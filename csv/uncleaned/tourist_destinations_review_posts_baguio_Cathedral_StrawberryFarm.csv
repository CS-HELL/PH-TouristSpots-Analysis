Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"The Baguio Cathedral is in the center of the city, just along session road. You have to climb up the famous stiff stairs but you have an option to go the other way. The Cathedral itself is huge and it's amazing as it's well maintained church though there's a lot of people going to mass. There's a Chapel that you can go to if you want a more secluded area and more peace."

You can reach it via taxi, Grab or just follow google while driving.Parking spaces are available but you will be charged per hour. There is a ticket upon entering and they‚Äôll charge you at the exit.There is also a food court but it was closed during our visit. Restrooms have minimal charge but are clean.When we got there, we were lucky to have heard mass and see and touch the Black Nazarene visiting Baguio."

Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"This church is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Baguio. We went here on a weekday. Hence, there are no crowds, and we were able to pray in peace and silence. If you want to hear Mass, go early since it is always packed with crowds especially during Sundays. There is a pay parking area in the front courtyard. As in any church in the Philippines, services are held in Filipino and English."

Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"Our Lady of Atonement Cathedral / Baguio CathedralOur Lady of Atonement Cathedral which is popularly known as Baguio Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral which was constructed in 1920 and got finished 1936.  It got its name from one of the titles given to Mary mother of Jesus. This church has a simple but elegant facade which (was) pink in color with rose style windows. It is located on top of Mount Mary Hill where visitors can access it using hundred steps stoneMy side story:I originally planned to come here after my appointment(Nov 4, 2021) at the Nationwide Health Systems Baguio Inc. but had to got to Triage first to secure a health certificate. God must have wanted me to go for adoration time before anything else bc there was surprisingly enormous surge of people at the place and each priority number takes a while to get accommodated on the counter. At that time they just called out for #26 and I got #56 on the line and was growing anxious waiting with the uncertain time I have left so i hopped in a cab and went to this beautiful city cathedral. The cathedral was like 5-10mins away from Triage so i figured I can spend a little more time there after saying my prayers. By the way, the cathedral is currently on renovation so I just managed to take a few photos inside and prayed at the Face of Jesus mini chapel located at the back of the cathedral. After 30mins, decided to go back to Triage and arrived just in time! My PN was called in within 5 mins! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èAs to my experience, Baguio Cathedral is a great place for spiritual reawakening! Try to visit and see why I said so üòâ I truly feel blessed for being able to visit and spend some prayer time here. My prayers were actually half answered by the time I stepped out of the clinic(my appointment in Baguio). Baguio Cathedral is a new addition to my favorite places ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚ù§Ô∏è"

Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,Forgot how to go about the Cathedral since the last time I visited Baguio was about 4 or 5 years ago. Went to the area to offer candles/prayers and to offer mass intentions. Loved how it's so near the best places. I just wish that I was there with better weather conditions.

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The strawberry farm was more organized now than the last time we visited. There is a huge parking space, restrooms are also available and garbage bins. The vendors are all on the side and their food maybe affordable but not very good quality. Hope they improve on this.The farm itself has been closed to the public and we were only able to close up to the gates. Despite it being closed to the public, I think this improved the farm by maximizing the space: putting lettuce below and strawberry on top (see last photo).It was fine for me that the public cannot pick strawberries for tourist purpose because it made a healthier growing environment for the strawberries. Hope people will support this so we can improve the quality of the PH Strawberry."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,This is one of the go-to places when visiting Baguio City. You can buy fresh strawberries here at an affordable price. The vendors are really nice and funny. They sell strawberry flavored ice cream and taho which is a must try! The place is very scenic as well.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"When we decided to go to this strawberry farm we wanted to make sure we will be allowed to pick our own strawberries, we checked with hotel staffs in holiday Inn, taxi drivers we rode in past 2days, vendors in local market nobody was sure if the strawberry season was still on (May 22). No phone number to call and check if we will be still allowed to pick our own strawberries. We arrived at the farm and it is a huge disappointed, Place is full of mud (make sure you are not wearing your favourite shoes), garages, discarded veggies everywhere. Walked half way in mud only to be told there is no starberries and have to go to the other enterance and try our luck there. Picking strawberries is expensive than buying from the store nearby. (Paint my fence and see how fun it is). Overall it feels more like a tourist trap. Good for Instagram influencers."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Good for shopping, not much for sightseeing or experience. Entrance fee of 10 pesos into the farms, but nothing much to see inside, and with all the strawberries harvested, there's no strawberry picking. Even the lettuce planted in this place can't be picked. But you can buy the purple and green lettuce at 50 pesos per stalk.Large strawberry farm with different owners separated by fences. It's a proper farm with workers going to and fro with their vegetable. You can take pictures here, but most spots aren't picture worthy, just take a random view.The area sells lots of goods not limited to strawberry. Vegetables are quite cheap here compared to NCR, so if you have the space or a fridge to put your haul later on, it's the best way to spend in this spot.There's a wide collection of fruit wines from strawberry, blueberry, mangosteen, Bugnay, etc, at 200 to 250 pesos per bottle, very nice. There's also a strange snake wine with aphrodisiac components for the daring, as the seller said it can also strengthen the bone. Strawberry here are sold at 150-200 per pack of about 1/4 to 1/2 kg, a little cheaper compared to other spots in Baguio that sell strawberries at 250 pesos for less the weight.There are a few canteen style lunch options, the drinks are pricey, and there's no service water or soup to go with the meals,.be prepared to pay about 180 pesos to 500 pesos for canteen style meals.There are other odd wooden toys and items for sale in this place, and strawberry taho and strawberry ice cream (the ice shaved type) here, and lots of parking space. It's a hotspot for people into buying things. Shopping is the norm here, you'll enjoy if you brought cash. Selected vendors accept GCash too, just ask them."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Went here to pick some strawberries but unfortunately it's not yet harvest season. Nice place to buy pasalubong and of course strawberries. There were a lot of stall to choose from. Be ready to bargain so you can get big discount.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"I'm not really fond of strawberries but the ones I had in the farm and pasalubong center were good. The strawberry shakes were good, too. There were a lot of shops to buy from."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The scenery is just that great and you can buy cheaper priced strawberry goods and vegetables.Avoid fixed taxi fare coz there are passing taxis here and you won't be stranded. The fare here is like less than 200 pesos from Genesis bus terminal if no heavy traffic, but if fixed you might get charged of 600 back and forth."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"This was quite a fun experience for us. The municipality of baguio is really strict when it comes to tourists coming from neighboring towns especially to ones who came from metro-manila NCR region. Nevertheless it was a compelling assurance that the people we get in touch with are uninfected or at least vaccinated. My group had so much fun with the different products the people has showcased. What gave us more excitement was the fact that we can actually pick our own strawberry fruits. It was not an everyday experience so for us, it was rare and really special. Hope to visit the place again. The people are also very kind which made it more friendly environment. The restaurant we ate with, gave us free vegetables to take home with us. We really appreciate our time here. Thank you so much la trinidad, strawberry farm!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"They have different varieties of pasalubong/take away treats to offer. From fresh fruits and vegetables, to the sweet and satisfying jams and other delicacy. They also sell souvenirs like Baguio printed shirts, keychains, broom, carved wood items, ref magnets and many more."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"So enjoyable, strawberrys are so delicious, fresh and so refreshing. I had taho strawberry and smoothie , Super sarap.There are great selections of vegetables, ornamental plants and herbs , just right for your culinary needs. Highly recommended"
