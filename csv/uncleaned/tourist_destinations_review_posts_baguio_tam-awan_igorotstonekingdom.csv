Tam-awan Village,"Reconstruction of traditional huts and showcasing Baguio arts/history. Nice and short hike trail especially for young people to get them starting, or a couple looking for fun time out. Some stairs or walkways missing handrails though."
Tam-awan Village,Place is a bit dark as there were alot of trees. Highlight of the attraction would be the paintings made by i believe people living there. There was quite of it and if you love paintings and a little bit of trecking you will enjoy the place. You can also buy items there as there is a souvenir shop inside as well as home made kitchen food.
Tam-awan Village,"If you're into nature tripping, this is the place for you to explore. Though, one has to be ready to take the challenge in climbing lots of stairs. Entrance fee is discounted for students and seniors and paid upon registration. There's a hut selling souvenirs, another hut if you want to have a sketch of yourself, another hut where you can have a tattoo. Lots of things to explore and do. But for seniors, take note to visit when its summer cause the stones and steps are slippery and not senior friendly. There's also a gallery featuring paintings of local talents."
Tam-awan Village,Been here before and it was not exactly what I remembered. I remembered more art pieces back then. More sculptures and huts. Also don't bring a stroller here you won't be able to use it. It will just be an added weight. It's a hike going here so be ready.
Tam-awan Village,One of the best tourist spot in Baguio! The place is kinda far from the city but super worth it. Though it's not kid and senior friendly because the stairs are too steep. The place is still perfect if you want to learn about Ifugaos.
Tam-awan Village,"Amazing views at the very top view deck, you can even see the new Igorot Stone Kingdom nearby. Can be quite challenging to climb some high steps throughout for the children and elderly, and some steps were slippery, but it's the closest to nature you can be without doing actual hiking. The cool air is also a plus."
Tam-awan Village,"This village is a blend of Arts and Baguio's Nature. Located at Pinsao Proper Baguio City, art and nature loving indivoduals will surely enjoy this new tourist spot in the City. Nearby tourist spot are the Igurot Stone Kingdom and the famouse Baguio Strawberry Farm"
Tam-awan Village,"When I first visited this place 10 years ago, there were lots of artworks to see. It really showcase what it was like for the indigenous igorots to live during their time. That's why I decided to take my kid this time around. I was disappointed. Very few artworks. The hike turned slippery and dangerous because of the drizzle we were experiencing that day. So we didn't do the full hike. We had to turn back and leave. It was a waste of entrance fee because we didn't see much. Also, there were people in costume if you want to take pictures with them for an additional fee. We tried to get in one of the huts to explore but there are 2 men (the one in costume) that was sleeping inside. So we felt like we were intruding. But this is supposed to be huts on display. I feel like they shouldn't be in there sleeping."
Tam-awan Village,"It's a small village, like a cultural village. There's a short trek, I believe its around 20-25 mins trek. you can also have a picture taken with staffs wearing an igorot costume."
Tam-awan Village,"If the culture or living conditions of people from this area are unknown to you, this place is a must place to visit..it is rather small but it showcases thr houses, terrain..additionally for me very tasty food in the cafe, well worth the price you pay...."
Tam-awan Village,This is such an amazing place! I love how they preserved the trees in this area amidst the busy city life to where it was strategically located. Be prepared for it is cold inside because of the big trees surrounding it.There is also a café inside and some artists who sketches impromptu if you want your own.Tam-awan Village is open daily from 8AM to 6PM including holidays. General Admission is ₱60 only.
Tam-awan Village,"The basic entrance fee is Php60 for adults, Php40 for students, and PhP30 for children below 10 years old. Children 3 years old and below may enter for free. The entrance fee is not worth it for the place.  There is no information about their culture, tradition. You will visit the place by your own with out explaining anything about the place."
Tam-awan Village,"Omg. Loved it.   The art work is amazing but the dancers were the highlight of my trip to Bagio.   (However,  my fiance was very quick to pull me away from the very handsome boys after the dance.)"
Tam-awan Village,The plants are beautiful but it can be seen that the heritage places or old things used by the Igorots in the past have been neglected and the path is not cleaned a bit slippery and dangerous for the elderly
Tam-awan Village,"Extremely disappointing. There is hardly any information around the site to describe anything you are looking at - you cannot learn much here. It’s just a place for taking photos (and not a very good place for that either). Also, the directional signage is really bad so it’s hard to know where you’re supposed to go."
Tam-awan Village,"First time to come here and I must say, anyone who comes to baguio should visit this culture-rich venue. Nature embraces the place and traditional stuff takes you back in time as if you experience the igorot's life first hand. Traditional dances performed were also a delight!"
Tam-awan Village,"They presserved their tradition very well especially the traditional dance. If you love art, you will surely fell inlove with their paintings."
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-Awan Village is a cultural and art hub built by local artists to showcase and preserve the heritage of Cordillera. It’s a must-have addition to your Baguio Trip and you will learn about the origins and culture of our fellow Igorots. Discover the way of life of the Igorots, and enthrall yourself in their vibrant lineage and heritage in this garden in the sky. If you’re going to Baguio City, make sure to include Tam-Awan Village in your itinerary."
Tam-awan Village,"When in Baguio :Visited the Tam-awan Village (meaning vantage point). Again, one must have good stamina to complete the tour. Beautiful culture and heritage."
Tam-awan Village,"One word I can say.. AMAZING. If only I can live on one of their huts, I will be contented forever in life. So peaceful and refreshing. I like buying all of those paintings and place it in my gallery room (if only I have a gallery room). So cool, really amazes me, and enchanting going up the wonderful hilly side as if going to heavens. 😊Best place I have been into"
Tam-awan Village,"This place is a bit different than most any other places I've been to or any other small villages of people of old. You'll want a good pair of hiking/walking-running shoes for this place since you'll be doing a lot of climbing and walking upstairs and downstairs and some of them can be quite slippery.It's doesn't take very long to visit this place. Maybe almost 2 hours and you can have a good tour of this village and what it has to offer. There's some nice pictures you can take and there's some staff who dress up as the tribe people and do a little ritual dance, which was fun to watch. The price wasn't a lot. I can't remember exactly but I remember it wasn't too much."
Tam-awan Village,It’s ok but not that exciting to go to. All you do there is just climb up a mini village
Tam-awan Village,Clean facilities.If you are an avid art enthusiast you will enjoy it here.
Tam-awan Village,"For a brief view of the Cordilleran culture, with mossy forest and fog thrillers..u can also buy paints arts"
Tam-awan Village,A great visit for a quick learning of Baguio's past culture. Good for kids too.
Tam-awan Village,"Be prepared to climb up a trail leading to the top for a nice view of nature.  Wear your rubber shoes or any time of hiking boots for easier climb. I was wearing my flats and skirt and it was a bad idea, although manageable.  You will appreciate the culture of the locals for example what their houses looked like during their time. They also have a small souvenir shop to buy a little memorabilia with you and a cafe inside."
Tam-awan Village,Nice place. Be ready to hike those stairs. They also feature a local group of dancers with their cultural igorot dance. There is also a small restaurant where we were served a local delicacy called pinikpikan.
Tam-awan Village,Not the tam-awan village that i used to go before. Hopefully more things to do here.
Tam-awan Village,A perfect place for lovers! Especially for couples who are wishing to have a child.❤️📵 - Free Wi-Fi❌ - 24H✔️ - Body Temperature Checking✔️ - Well Maintained Area✔️ - Entrance Fee of 50.00PHP❌ - Parking Area✔️ - Food Stalls✔️ - Comfort Rooms⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Historical📸📸📸📸📸 - Instagrammable😊😊😊😊😊 - Enjoyable           - For Lovers & Family Bonding🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿 - Nature Tripping
Tam-awan Village,I've been here 4 years ago and I enjoyed my time here. The locals were nice and having a tour around the place made me glad because they were able to preserve their culture for the new generations to see. I heard that they have added some new attractions recently and I hope I could come back to visit again some time in the future.
Tam-awan Village,This place is a good place to know more about the life of native people in Benguet. There are guides who will tour you around the village. There is a few hike in view deck 2. The cafe is nice. I love their brewed coffee! Must try!
Tam-awan Village,"An amazing place for nature and art. The place is on a mountain where you can hike to different places like a dream catcher hut, spiritual hut and 2 view decks."
Tam-awan Village,Great showcase for Baguio artists. Artworks of various media enrich Filipinos' appreciation of own culture.  Let us support local artists by patronizing their works of art.
Tam-awan Village,"When you enter you pay a small fee. In my opinion it is so worth it. The fee helps with the up keep of the place. It's a small compound but feels like a big adventure inside. They feature small art galleries, restaurant and a viewing deck that's perfect for sunsets."
Tam-awan Village,Lot's of parked cars and hard to commute going back to burnham
Tam-awan Village,"Date of visit 2019 Dec 23.Time of visit 10.40 am to 12.50 pm.Sight Seeing 6.5.Transportation / Getting there 6.Ambience 8.Price PHP60/pax.Expected exploration time 1 to 2 hours.Sight Seeing: This is small sky jungle with a wishing well / pond, huts, dream catchers and hill top views. There is also a cafe inside. Great shots can be taken depending on your ingenuity with nature. The uphill climb has some slight risks, trek slowly and firmly on the muddy terrain, some rocks could be slippery and even dry terrain is dusty and flaky and is a slip hazard. Some parts of the trek do not have any railings to prevent an accidental downhill fall. Nevertheless, it is fairly simply uphill trek for elementary school kids with adequate caution. The only drawback is that this attraction is isolated, as compared to Camp John Hay or Mines View Park.Transportation: Transportation in Baguio for those without a private transport is either jeepney or taxi. The Jeepney begins the journey from Fairview Central Jeepney Terminal, Hilltop street. Then, it takes about 15 mins to reach Tam Awan Village.Ambience: The garden jungle provides just enough challenge for all ages. The air is fresh and clean as expected."
Tam-awan Village,Wear comfy shoes coz its a climb up. Really portrays how our native cordilleran brethren lives.
Tam-awan Village,Huge place. They will give you a map so you can guide yourselves when roaming inside. There's no too much difference compared to other landmarks in Baguio. It's like a combination of museums and view decks that were formed on the same area. It's still a cool place to go.
Tam-awan Village,It's a few tribal houses maintained like old style. And u can do little trekking.
Tam-awan Village,If you are looking for a solemn nature trip this is a good place especially if not peak season. At the same time you'll be able to appreciate the tribe's culture and art. :)
Tam-awan Village,Nature and art in one place. Not very much accessible to public transport so its best to rent a private vehicle/cab/taxi to bring you to and from this place. Entrance fee is collected for maintenance and upkeep. Some areas may be slippery especially on wet season. Late review - visit date: May 2018
Tam-awan Village,a short but very invigorating nature trip. dont try to miss this one. we had a mini hike to the top and had much fun. then we check different native house. good thing they were able to preserve it. and ofcourse the art gallery thats so wonderful. you gotta appreciate the way they did their craft. see sample of pictures. enjoy
Tam-awan Village,"Nice little place, intersting to see the artists paintings,scultures, little exhibitions in the traditionnal houses even though that's not a village. mini trek, in the beajtiful landscape around it."
Tam-awan Village,So perfect when you need some me time... Walking through the paths and discovering branched ways along the way for me is the best feeling... I find it meditating and don't forget to walk through the area with mirrors!It takes about 2 hours if you are alone and wants to discover the place by yourself... Quite difficult to reach thru public transport due to limited jeepneys so taxi is better.
Tam-awan Village,It is good for somebody visiting Baguio for the first time to go and see Taw Awan Village
Tam-awan Village,"Thank you Tam - awan villageThe place is good, so relaxing, and the igorot dance so enjoy to watch, friendly staffWe will promote this place to our friendsLove it❤️❤️❤️"
Tam-awan Village,"It's a must-go for everyone visiting Baguio. Entrance is 60 PHP per person and you'll have a helpful guide to tell tales about the Ibaloi culture from their religion to daily living.The tour lasts around one hour and you'll be taken to art exhibits, old houses, and view points.You can buy arts and crafts stuff, which I think are reasonably priced considering they monopolize the area. Many souvenir stuff there are uniquely found in the place, so if you LOVE something, buy it!You can also buy paintings and have a sketching session.They also have a restaurant that serves delicious meals. We ordered Pinikpikan (surprisingly large enough for 4 to 5 people), Pomodoro Pasta, and a bottle of Strawberry Wine (which is fair priced at 250 PHP).As a side note: Pinikpikan is a dish using chicken meat that was repeatedly beaten to death, giving it a unique taste because of the blood clots. Besides chicken, it also has salted pork (Etag)."
Tam-awan Village,I love anything ethnic and this place has a lot to offer they even has a dance show ( igorot dance)  with igorot costume. What i love here most is the gallery with paintings of different artist. They also have shop where you can buy souvenirs and if you want accommodation they have also the igorot house where you will experience first hand. Don' forget to trekk You'll love the experience.
Tam-awan Village,"A few Igorot native huts scattered in the property,  a cafe, a barebones gallery and souvenir shop,  plus a challenging hike up the hillside (Garden in the sky) which is really not advisable for elderly and not so active people,  that's all there is to this destination. Quite not worth the 60 pesos entrance fee."
Tam-awan Village,"Garden in the sky, nice place to visit if you're within Baguio and want a little hike. It has replicas of traditional Ifugao houses, small art galley, and a view deck on top."
Tam-awan Village,A native village with their natice houses. There is a resto insidrle and an artist who sketched in 20 mins of any picture but would take around 20 mins more so a total of 40 mins. The pathway to the viewdeck is unsafe specially if there would be a rain. View could not really be appreciated if there is a fog
Tam-awan Village,"This is the place where the rich cultural heritage of the Cordillerans are displayed through the ingenius artworks of many well-known artists. From paintings and drawings on display, to simple handmade accessory in their souvenir shop, there'll surely be something in store for everyone. Great for presents to friends and loved ones. I esp. loved the coffee shop/resto, nice ambience. Minimal entrance fee (P50 for adults). For students, make sure to bring your ID's to get a discount. Tip: Come during the summer months. The pathways are narrow/ascending and tends to get muddy/slippery. Wear comfortable shoes."
Tam-awan Village,"Make sure you use proper shoes for ""biglaang hiking"" haha! Better be safe than sorry because I was wearing vans shoes and it's very slippery. Overall experience is a perfect 10/10! The view, paintings, weather, food, people and the history in it are very well taken care of."
Tam-awan Village,"It was okay. View from the deck was not so good with mostly just roofs and houses. Parking is not very many. I liked the pond, the native houses. There is also a souveneir shop, an art gallery, a very short trail, and a view deck."
Tam-awan Village,"Truly a place to see in La Trinidad that preserves cultural heritage.Seniors may find it a challenge with steep climbs and stairs. But for those I saw after visiting the place, surely felt glad to have done so.Park your vehicles along the side of the road and will be asssited by attendants. PUJ's are also available for commuters.Your next stop should be Mount Costa."
Tam-awan Village,"so-so with lil kids they are short tempered this place are for those who loves nature and art at the same time...  trails are slippery. if ill got lot money and decorate home with paintings surely i know where i could buy (ill come back here). the only regret was i should start the trail at the right side instead at the left trail...  because i saw a portrait on the spot for only 150/head 30 mins to finish good remembrance to keep. (i was not able to got my portrait because of the hungry,  irritating kids with me)😕entrance fee is 50/adultkids 10-below 20/ head3ft and below -free(*paintings are for sale * souvenir shop inside* resto inside)"
Tam-awan Village,"Nice place, a bit long trail with hiking. The steps sometimes is slippery because of the moss, seniors are advisable to be escorted to prevent slippage."
Tam-awan Village,"A traditional heritage cottages and show, with small land scape of jungle, and nothing more, they have restaurant but no any traditional foods"
Tam-awan Village,Tam Awan Village - Garden in the Sky. You can find an authentic Igorot Hut with a village trail designed to adapt to the natural mountainous trail of the Cordilleras. A must have visit! A fee of 60 pesos for Adults and 40 for kids.
Tam-awan Village,One of the quiet place we've visit in Baguio
Tam-awan Village,"I have been coming here for years. The only thing that has noticeably changed is more trails on the hill and couple buildings.  Some early artist have made a name for themselves for sure. But i don't understand this place. By now with the cash that have brought in and the artists that have been through here they should have a museum, endowment, much improved artists spaces and able to support and nurture an entire community of artists.  Either way, ill keep coming, hoping one day its true potential will be borne out!"
Tam-awan Village,This place brings you closer to the arts and traditions of the indigeneous tribe of Benguet Mt. Province-- The Igorot tribe.A cultural dance is also something that you shouldn't miss!
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-awan has a great summary of Cordilleran history if you haven't discovered any of these. Moreover, the place is also a spot to pick-up souvenirs. The downsides of this spot is that it's a little ways off the city proper and it's a little underdeveloped (which in hindsight, may be because they want to keep the mountainside feel). You should be careful if you are bringing Seniors."
Tam-awan Village,it's a go-to place for art lover peeps but a tiring place to go around. haha
Tam-awan Village,A cultural historical place where the basic lives of our ancestor showcased and preserved well.
Tam-awan Village,"Entrance fee Php 60, strawberry and ube taho are available, there are Ifugao houses, cafe, sketch area and art gallery. Taxi rate from Burham is Php 110 pesos. Long wait for taxi /jeep going back to Burnham."
Tam-awan Village,"Place is cool. Nice contrast of green and red which is relaxing in the eyes. A little hike, overlooking, overall... it's refreshing."
Tam-awan Village,Very informative about the Igorots culture. I love the displayed paintings. Just be careful especially when you decide to climb the higher part of the village.
Tam-awan Village,Love the paintings here
Tam-awan Village,An immersive experience.I get to enjoy their dance performances.Will require you to traverse steep rocky climbs.
Tam-awan Village,"Good art works. But we were lost inside because of lack of signages and no one to guide us. ""Can't find the beauty of this place"" I comemented to my sister who is with me during my visit here."
Tam-awan Village,"If you are planning to visit Tam awan, you need to wear shoes because its slippery this place is a mountain so you gonna climb to see the small cottages made of wood, the small art gallery. Going there takes 20mins by taxi. And the intrance fee is 60 pesos for adult and 30 pesos for the kids."
Tam-awan Village,Don't expect too much when you go the place..entrance fee is 60 pesos for adult..they have cafe if you want to eat
Tam-awan Village,Good for long walking. Great heights. Near farmer's daughter resto. Be early or you lose the parking space.
Tam-awan Village,Awesome historical place. Must visit. Do take the guided tour. Closes like 6 pm in the evening. So plan better.
Tam-awan Village,"This is not your usual tourist destination.  The Village requires you to hike to reach the different art installations and cultural artifacts. It can be difficult for young kids.  We were actually dissuaded from climbing to the 2nd View Deck because the kids may not make the climb.  The trail around the Village was a bit slippery. However, the trails were clearly marked and the art pieces had their own name plates and descriptions.  The aroma from the cafe was also appetizing."
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-awan, meaning vantage point, is a reconstructed Cordillera village. Aside from a great view of Baguio, you are also treated to beautiful works of art by local artists, displayed in galleries around the village. Definitely a must-visit location when in Baguio!"
Tam-awan Village,Foods are great and staff are friendly! Will surely come back the next time we visit Baguio City. Highly recommended. Wi-Fi access is awesome!
Tam-awan Village,Absolutely wonderful place full of art and other hidden gems. You'll find an unlimited supply of Instagramable places for photo ops!
Tam-awan Village,April 14 2017I was in tam awan village back in april 14 2017. Its a must visit destination in baguio city and pet friendly also.
Tam-awan Village,"A must place to visit in Baguio...to understand Tam Awan's Culture and Arts.  A little exercise of your hiking ability, so be ready with your comfy shoes and enjoy the nature while visiting this village."
Tam-awan Village,Not much going on in here. Just a quick art tour around to appreciate. Involves a bit of climbing which are also slippery on the rainy season. View is honestly terrible from the view decks. There is a place to eat and have coffee here
Tam-awan Village,"A really nice cultural place to visit in while you're in Baguio. There are traditional huts, cafes, and at exhibitions held here."
Tam-awan Village,A visual artist’s sanctuary. Anyone who loves arts will love this place though it has a very creepy vibe.
Tam-awan Village,Place is ok. Perfect for nature-loving tourists.
Tam-awan Village,"The entrance fee is at PhP60.00 for adults.This isn't a living native village instead this is a man-made landscape designed for tourists to be able to take a nice hike. They have interesting plants, they have museum pieces such as a real rice granary that was used by the natives long ago, replicas of native houses and their different functions. This is a place for people who are interested to learn cultures.I recommend wearing a good pair of shoes fit for hiking as the ground tend to be slippery."
Tam-awan Village,"You can stay here in an historical hut, cottage. Walking up and down between the huts to two view points. Meet artist and and do different art class. Take taxi to go there only 60 piso, jeepney back."
Tam-awan Village,Nice garden but only takes 1/2 to an 1 hour to go through not well maintained paths supports post loss for hand rails
Tam-awan Village,Amazing view. specially in viewdeck 2. The cultural dancers are good. The place was nice. Its near Farmers daughter restaurant and igorot stone kingdom.
Tam-awan Village,This spot is worth it! Esp if u like nature tripping.Restau inside is good too!
Tam-awan Village,"The best for pictorial, and also the ambiance of the trees"
Tam-awan Village,"The place is full of art works. Not for the elderly as the steps are steep. We went when it was raining, not recommended during the rainy season"
Tam-awan Village,Nice place for learning the traditional Igorot culture and art. Also offers lots of souvenirs for tourists.
Tam-awan Village,Big area to go around and you'll see art pieces and replica artifacts of how the tribes lived. Their view deck was a bit sad cause your view was the clustered houses.
Tam-awan Village,"The view was good. If you love climbing mountains, you can go here."
Tam-awan Village,Indigenous surroundings showcasing the culture of the people! Painting workshops and galleries too!
Tam-awan Village,Great tourist spot!  Probably the best place to go in Baguio!  Did not see many tourists in Baguio and will not return. Too dirty and loud now!
Tam-awan Village,- Loved the place ❤️- Amazing staff 😍- Place is a bit slippery so be careful 😘
Tam-awan Village,If you are a nature lover you will love this place..Comes with great view deck.
Tam-awan Village,"An open museum close to nature just like Pinto Art and Bencab, P60.00 per person (2019). A twist in here is that you have go up and down with the cliffs to enjoy the views. Be careful of the unknown insects here. We went here and had multiple bites that we still dont know what insects are they."
Tam-awan Village,Too slippery.  I was more concerned on where I'm stepping.The young Igorot dancers were a joy to watch though.
Tam-awan Village,"This place is for those who appreciate art & poetry, paintings, sculptures, nature, short trek, and the like. Thank you for putting up a haven for the local artists and promoting the crafts and ingenuity of Baguio/Northern Luzon folks. The cafe is artistically designed and the food is served fresh and hot, great for cold waether. I liked all thei food choices. Taste of the local is great. The coffee smells good. I brought a Korean friend here and he loved it."
Tam-awan Village,"Has limited access for parking and not accessible for PWDs.The stairs are man made, the rails are bamboos and the steps are carved from soil which makes it muddy and slippery during rainy season.If you are going with kids or with oldies, I do not recommend going during rainy season."
Tam-awan Village,how great theifugao dancers to watch the traditional dance of ifugao
Tam-awan Village,Nice place to relax your mind. This garden is full of arts and cultural information.
Tam-awan Village,"Peaceful. If you're looking for something that is of art and nature related, this is the place to be."
Tam-awan Village,Great cultural experience. Some parts are muddy and slippery. We enjoyed our adventure here. It's far from the urban area but the experience is worthy.
Tam-awan Village,This is our last stop for our 3day Baguio Tour and it didn't dissapoint us. We get to see the different traditional houses for the rich and poor of the natives way back.
Tam-awan Village,Nice artsy Igorot village replica with house designs you could actually live in. Also nice artworks in their gallery. Too bad they don't serve any civet cat coffee. I bought two packs two years ago and it was heavenly. Now the one I bought in Sagada is not as good.
Tam-awan Village,Quick cultural immersion.  Highly recommended if you have not visited this tourist spot.
Tam-awan Village,Great place for art lover also very peaceful and cool place
Tam-awan Village,"For just 60 pesos, you get to experience the cool and quiet Tam-Awan Village. It was fun seeing works of local artists which really showed the rich culture of the place."
Tam-awan Village,Good place to visit. Need to ready your feet
Tam-awan Village,The guided tour was a little short but it was very informative.  Would highly recommend.
Tam-awan Village,"Nice place to unwind alongside the nice weather of Baguio. Although, would suggest that they'll put another view deck on top. To see the overview."
Tam-awan Village,You have to had enough energy to climb to viewdeck. The scenery is beautiful and for me its refreshing.
Tam-awan Village,Amazing Artworks
Tam-awan Village,"Place is, uhm good to visit if you have kids. And if you're really looking for the ethnic experince. No Tam-Awans to see though, would be worth it if you'd pay for the guide. The food in their restaurant is great!!"
Tam-awan Village,"If you are truly a nature lover,you can drop and visit the place,what you can see there is the old ways of living of their people,their kind of old house or kubo in the village.What i like there is the trekking i perspire a bit even its too cold in there....and be careful of the animals esp...the snake we saw a very small snake ,like the size of our smallest finger and i call the attention of the guide,and what he told us is just be careful coz we dont kill them,i am with him though.....all in all its an experience also its cold there,and please buy their products...."
Tam-awan Village,A very relaxing and peaceful place with real touch of nature..
Tam-awan Village,Good place and good hike to get to the top and take instagram-able photos.
Tam-awan Village,"Nice view over baguio, very cold weather, also its a bit big and required a little bit of hiking."
Tam-awan Village,Awesome place!!! Thank you!
Tam-awan Village,"Nice place to visit in Baguio, but very small area to walk around."
Tam-awan Village,A humble place that showcase Baguio Local Artists. A must visit in baguio.
Tam-awan Village,"I miss those times when there were real Igorot tour guides who tell you about their culture and Tamawan Village. Don't forget to go inside the huts, some of them are accessible."
Tam-awan Village,Great!
Tam-awan Village,Of all the places I've visited so far in Baguio this is where I enjoyed the most. A must visit place. Promise.
Tam-awan Village,"This is a wonderful experience, not just for me, but for my nieces and nephews too.Will definitely go back there in the future."
Tam-awan Village,First time but this place never disappoint me. I love the view from the top.
Tam-awan Village,A perfect display of Cordilleran culture located at Benguet.
Tam-awan Village,"An alternative experience in Baguio apart from the usual tourist sites. My favorite, besides the beautiful artwork of Baguio artists, is the trek up the view point to witness the Baguio sunset."
Tam-awan Village,Good place and friendly staff the boss was also very accomodating. Loved the bonfire!
Tam-awan Village,"Great place to learn about cordilleran culture and heritage. There are other places to visit within Baguio (or the whole of the Cordillera Region), but you should Tam-awan village in your itinerary."
Tam-awan Village,Where art and nature meet. But I think the entrance fee of 60 pesos may not be that reasonable.
Tam-awan Village,"Place is too small. No good spot for taking pictures. Muddy stairs, kinda dangerous."
Tam-awan Village,Nice place I enjoyed it. They got native igorot dance.
Tam-awan Village,If u like a light trail... preferrably afternoon... the cafe served good food
Tam-awan Village,Place is good if you want to see a photo gallery and watch a cultural dance and also if you want to see a beautiful sceneries of Benguet.
Tam-awan Village,"Educational..nice place to enrich cultural values. Nice Trekking place, you just have to be careful."
Tam-awan Village,Nice place to see the culture of cordillera and meet with the locals
Tam-awan Village,Awesome with free coffee  and camote due to festival
Tam-awan Village,Beautiful place that showcases art of indigenous people.
Tam-awan Village,Liked it so much the restaurant there is good too
Tam-awan Village,This place is a must visit! Shows how rich the culture of the region is.
Tam-awan Village,It's my 1st time here and I enjoyed it.
Tam-awan Village,For 60 pesos entrance it's okay. Not super big but they have a small trail and gallery. And other things Takes around a hour to see everything.
Tam-awan Village,A good place to learn about history and culture. Visit this place when it is not raining to avoid slipping along the stairs while climbing.
Tam-awan Village,This place is great but there is little to see. You may find great paintings in their art museum. You may also want your portrait to be painted by the artists that frequents there. You may also experience dancing the cordillera dance when you go there in tge weekends.
Tam-awan Village,Totally love this place just view the photo😍
Tam-awan Village,"They’ve re-opened since August. It’s my second time after more than 10 years and it is still a beautiful place to appreciate nature and Ifugao culture. We hiked, entered the typical Igorot house, breathed fresh air, feasted in a rich flora & ended with a free taste of local wines — strawberry, duhat, rice wine, over some street food. Bought a woven head band in the souvenir shop."
Tam-awan Village,Food are expensive if you don't like art what's point visiting it
Tam-awan Village,Love the arts. The ambience is great.
Tam-awan Village,Historical arts and culture
Tam-awan Village,I liked the traditional dance. The hiking trail was tough and a bit dangerous for children aged 7 below. I saw one snake passing by in front of me. I was not so shocked because the place is almost like a forest with a community inside.
Tam-awan Village,The place is good for exploring. Good stuff. The trail is very slippery specially during rainy days. You'll find no guides or anyone to ask for assistance. They have a disclosure of being not liable for any injuries occurred inside so be very careful.
Tam-awan Village,Amazing art and view in one place.
Tam-awan Village,They have rooms that you can book for an overnight stay.
Tam-awan Village,Very educational. Made me appreciate my country's culture even more.
Tam-awan Village,"Art, culture, education and fun in 1"
Tam-awan Village,A Local village with traditional cultural information and arts.
Tam-awan Village,"One of a kind place. There are 2 galleries here a souvenir shop and a cafe on site with local grown coffee and eats. All the souvenirs are local made. Follow all the paths when you are there some beautiful and unique hidden spots. Like the pathway of mirrors; the bamboo bridges, hidden koi pond, spirit house and more."
Tam-awan Village,Super nice. 😊 Amazing artworks.
Tam-awan Village,"Good place to go on a weekday where visitors are not that many. Tho on the weekend cordilleran cultural dance is presented. Honestly nothing much to see, it's basically a hillside decorated with cordilleran huts that are not that awing. Again what's good the see are the cultural dancers and the traditional cordilleran attire you can use for free that you won't look like a tourist. They also have a portrait artist who has excellent work."
Tam-awan Village,Nice place for nature lovers.
Tam-awan Village,"It's a great place to get to know the people of Tam-awan. Learn about their way of living, their culture and their art. You can also join them dance! The area is mossy though probably because of the season during our visit. But it's worth to visit."
Tam-awan Village,full of art..cool weather..awesome!!
Tam-awan Village,Not much to expect. A hundred bucks fee is not really worth it. Parking is a mess. A very risky hiking experience with a not so safe trail and stairways.
Tam-awan Village,"eat at there cafe, they'll served you an over size meals 👌👌👌"
Tam-awan Village,It was ok not that much good what we think
Tam-awan Village,"It was a bit rainy because of two tropical depressions in Luzon but the place was still open, there were still some people visiting the place. The map they provided was simple enough to understand, somedays there are cultural presentations inside but we didn't see one. The experience was quite enlightening to have to witness the eclectic art collection and the different houses of the Cordilleras."
Tam-awan Village,It is great place! But too small. They have a biggest dream catcher I ever seen. And some arts from tribe are so beautiful.P.S don't go up. Nothing there in upper view point.
Tam-awan Village,still love going to this place. it's like my comfort zone when in baguio.
Tam-awan Village,A must visit place in Baguio ! The place has a lot of steps so expect a little “hike”. The steps could get a little slippery especially if it has rained. Might not be grandparent or child friendly however the beautiful scenery is worth the hike. Must watch the cultural dance as well !
Tam-awan Village,The peak is one of my most fave points. You can really see the fog. We came here and it was rainy so I would say that the village was not as vibrant as it should be. The have a nice gallery and accomodating staff. It was also brownout when we came here and they have no gensets so yeah. I wish they could improve the stairs and the path.
Tam-awan Village,"Good place to explore to appreciate nature, art, and culture. Be sure to ask for guidance how to navigate the facility."
Tam-awan Village,So many excitement place and the dancer igorot so very good😊
Tam-awan Village,"If you're up for a quick trek, this is it. Parts of the trail are slippery too as some are moist and a bit muddy. My companions who can't make it up stayed to view the galleries that showcased the rich culture of the locals"
Tam-awan Village,"If you are into arts and culture or just in search of the perfect background for your next profile picture, this place is for you. There are colorful murals and paintings and well preserved ancient Igorot houses. There are cafes and restaurants nearby too. However, caution is proper if you are with children and elderlies because visitors need to climb some steep stairs to fully explore the whole village."
Tam-awan Village,"Family bonding, relaxing.. nice place.. friends venue..😘😍😊"
Tam-awan Village,very good place for the culturally-inclined
Tam-awan Village,We didn't really enjoy it quite slippery make sure to wear proper trekking shoes if you want to visit it and enjoy to the fullest... Entrance fee is a dollar or less so don't expect much unless you are a really really nature lover.
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-awan Village really made sure Baguio's culture will be showcased in the most authentic possible way. However, guests are not ""warned"" of the steep trek going to the viewpoint. There were no signs around the place how many more meters/steps to finish the trail. Overall, will still recommend to teens or adult tourists but not kids and seniors."
Tam-awan Village,"experience local culture and arts here. it is also an artist haven ( have your pencil sketch done by a local artist, in Dec 2019 it was PhP 300 for about 10-15 minutes live sketching). you can arrange to stay at traditional igorot house and enjoy nature in this village."
Tam-awan Village,Really liked the experience. Simple hike and it's an important good to support local culture. It's also good to be a part of helping reduce poverty around the world and especially in the Philippines.
Tam-awan Village,We visited December 2017. There's really not much to see aside from very few interesting things plus the hike. They should either develop it or at least lessen the fee so they could attract more people.
Tam-awan Village,Very relaxing place to go around and check on different artworks. Parking is a problem
Tam-awan Village,The area was not organizedTemperature was great
Tam-awan Village,Fun place to visit while in Baguio
Tam-awan Village,"I wouldn't say it's the most original but I think it's still a great place or something you'll put in your 'lists of places to go when visiting Baguio'. The art gallery contains a lot of interesting things and also there are things that will make you go ooooh and of course, there are stuffs that will make you go 'mehh'. It also showcases some cultural and historical topics and themes about Cordillera. Overall, I find It great and still has a lot of space to grow."
Tam-awan Village,Prepeare for a hiking experience to reach the top of the said mountain perfect to watch the sunset. The art here is truly amazing and you can even get a sketch of yourself
Tam-awan Village,"It is a quite interesting place to visit when you've been to Baguio a couple of times and you hope to go somewhere other than the usual destinations in Baguio. But I find it a bit small, and I was hoping to see more. However the entrance fee was inexpensive, so I suppose it wasn't all that bad."
Tam-awan Village,trail was neat and easy 😊 good for family affair. gallery featured Eclipse 🌒
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-awan used to be a nice place where different local artists can exhibit their works. Now, it is now poorly maintained and the facilities are so old. There are no good views from here and trail is far to be appreciated."
Tam-awan Village,A place to relax and feel the nature while walking in the trails. There are artworks and live band.
Tam-awan Village,"If you are into culture, arts, tradition, and environment, this place is for you. You,ll find paintings as well as murals in the area. There are some replica houses of the northern Cordillera tribes. There are also huts/rooms for rent to stay for the night. A must place to visit when in Baguio"
Tam-awan Village,Good food. Have to prepare yourself with steep steps though.
Tam-awan Village,Appreciate more if there is a tour guide who will explain the stuffs inside the village
Tam-awan Village,Awesome place!
Tam-awan Village,You can feel that they are trying to preserve their traditions. A group of will showcase their traditions by doing some of their traditional dances. Surprisingly they have little room that has full of paintings which.
Tam-awan Village,In short there really wasn't much at all to see and do. The 2nd view deck also has no views and no deck. It is just an overgrown loop track with nothing much to see. There are much better tourist destinations to see in Ph than here. Not worth the visit IMO.
Tam-awan Village,"Climbed to the top, to see what's on view deck 2, and I was disappointed. Trees were covering the supposed to be view but if you really try to look beyond those trees, you'll see houses. Urbanization destroyed the surrounding area. I am not complaining, I tried to see what's in it at least. Should have taken a pic"
Tam-awan Village,"Not much to see except for the local cultural dance. If you like walking on elevated dirt paths then go ahead and try it. Otherwise, try going somewhere else instead."
Tam-awan Village,"Garden in the  sky, that's  Tam awan village  although  its  not a  real native  village  but has  been converted to contemporary  art gallery where  you can get  nature  and  art  .Nestled into the hilly mountains of Baguio is an unsuspecting art village. At a glance, you only notice traditional huts with grass roofs scattered on different levels of elevation throughout the forest.they  have  nice  forest views  koi  ponds and  much more. Enterance  is  60 Php"
Tam-awan Village,"I went there september 28, 2022"
Tam-awan Village,There's a cute cat in here. The cat was sleeping and keeps on sleeping while we are there. They also got a cafe wherr you can buy coffee for an affordable price. We got an unexpected trekking there.
Tam-awan Village,"Best to go when there's an event or tourist seasons like holy week. Get there by taxi, around P90 from town, w traffic. Also a Jeep route, but forgot what it's called. On regular days, the ""village"" is dead."
Tam-awan Village,"If you love nature, visit the place"
Tam-awan Village,I love the place small compact but able  to tell the world of its heritage
Tam-awan Village,"Well preserved place of history and culture to know what Baguio City really is about. The place is a bit steep and high, so if planning of going, it is better to wear comfortable clothes to fully enjoy the place and tour."
Tam-awan Village,"Nice place, nice heritage, nice people and nice coffee. Love this place but be extra careful in driving their roads."
Tam-awan Village,ambiance is nice but viewdeck 2 is not worth it. culture is well maintained.
Tam-awan Village,Best place to escape from stressful working week. A place to bond with your love ones.
Tam-awan Village,The place to get your art fix. A one stop shop for culture and arts. Witness the traditional cordillera dances...have your portrait drawn or if you are lucky you might get a nice view of the sunset.
Tam-awan Village,The entrance fee for adults is 60php and 40php for students and kids. It was affordable for a very nice place to visit. :) You can even wear their traditional costume for free.
Tam-awan Village,Culture Rich Resto. But you have to pay entrance fee.. hope to lower the fee
Tam-awan Village,A fairly exhausting yet enjoyable side trip specially when you choose to continue hiking until the end of the trail. Lots of interesting stuff to see.
Tam-awan Village,"if you want to experience some traditions of cordillera, the taste of Ki-niing (smoke meat) and see exquisite painting of local artist, you should visit this place."
Tam-awan Village,Very interesting place although not extensive. Wandering at your leisure you come across some delightful views and some interesting buildings and pathways.
Tam-awan Village,"A must visit if you are in Baguio. Well worth the symbolic price of 50 pesos. Went on a gloomy day and it was picture perfect. A bit slippery and lots of stairs, so not recommended for the elderly."
Tam-awan Village,Small village with interesting stories. Hard to find parking though
Tam-awan Village,"It's a good place to unwind and relax not that much crowded,not that typical it's between a hiking and art place, there's a restaurant nearby were you can eat exotic food"
Tam-awan Village,"It a good place to see culture and arts, especially the works of the many talented artists displayed. It also shows the wonders of nature with many plant life atop of a slope."
Tam-awan Village,Very cool place. But it's veru tiring to get up to the mountains. Not everyone can finish the whole tour. I suggest to read the notice in the entrance before proceeding.
Tam-awan Village,Good location for appreciation of Cordilleran tradition.
Tam-awan Village,Rode a bike from Burnham Park to this place. Good for those who are appreciative of arts and culture of the tribe. Too many paintings. There's a souvenir store and sketch service inside.
Tam-awan Village,"Great stop for your Baguio trip. You can see here the Cordilleran culture from the houses, bul-ols and arts. They have free guided tours"
Tam-awan Village,"I haven't been to anywhere else like Tam-awan village. Hence, the five stars. I learned a lot about the lifestyle of the natives. The staff are actually Igorots. We talked to one of them and he taught us a lot about the bululs and some of the rituals. The place is big, but they'll give you a small map upon entering to help you navigate the area."
Tam-awan Village,"I'm not sure where the good reviews came from but it's gonna be 1 star for me. Probably because I've been to better studios, seen better installations that are priced with way more value for my money. At 50 pesos you'd get to see a mishmash of mirrors made in china (with the 15 peso price tag still intact) hung around bushes they called an art installation!I am all for Cordilleran cultural education but when I read about their justification of making their own bulul of their own invention (in the pretext of art) and installed to serve a purpose of their own imagined purpose I was disappointed.The entire place is disappointing, it's an embarrassment to the local culture it professes to promote. It's a complete hoax (except for a few select pieces) and it tried so hard to mask it by setting up authentic Cordilleran houses."
Tam-awan Village,I came here with no expectations but I really enjoyed the place.   There will be a bit of walking involved so make sure you wear the right shoes especially if you want to explore the place. Take your time in each kubo to appreciate the artworks.
Tam-awan Village,"I hope their food has more taste than their coffee, which was about 50% strength. Otherwise, charming atmosphere to relax after hiking the hills."
Tam-awan Village,Peaceful… arts and nature
Tam-awan Village,"Tam awan village a bit far from the city center, you need to pay an entrance fee of 50 and you need a strong knees to climb up the big stones stairs, their gallery is nice, we did not stay long its hard to go up hahahaha not suitable for  very old people."
Tam-awan Village,"This place is for people who appreciate and respect ""art, culture and tradition"" of the Cordilleras. One must wear appropriate footwear in order to be able to ""hike"" the trails."
Tam-awan Village,Symbolizes traditional Ifugao culture
Tam-awan Village,"It's a very good place to have a look of the rich Cordilleran culture. Just bring a good rubber shoes, it's a slippery slope during rainy days and in the morning."
Tam-awan Village,The best part of the experience was watching a performance of mountain tribal dances
Tam-awan Village,"we loved Tam awan the first time we visited in 2014, but we were utterly disappointed when we went back last march 2018, they weren't able to maintain it's beauty especially the view deck 2, and the fact that they collect entrance fee per head but still weren't able to maintain it just adds to our disappointment"
Tam-awan Village,Great place to feel the culture of the Northern Province.
Tam-awan Village,"Theres payment for comfort room, 5 pesos. Not that clean and theres no tissue. Very slippery when climbing up. Theres not that much too see except houses from a high point of view."
Tam-awan Village,Not much to see. The village l visited a decade ago seems much better. It seem it was relocated. Nothing to see but small museum and a few hike. Entrance fee is not worth it.
Tam-awan Village,"Eight traditional Ifugao homes and two rare Kalinga huts were taken apart and then reassembled on the side of a hill at the artist colony Tram-awan Village. Spending the night in one of these huts is a rare treat. You can participate in art workshops, learn dream-catcher making, and see indigenous music and dance demonstrations. On clear days there are wonderful views of the South China Sea. To get there, take a Quezon Hill-Tam-awan or Tam-awan-Long-Long jeepney from the corner of Kayang and Shagem Sts."
Tam-awan Village,It's more on arts and culture
Tam-awan Village,It's good to see the place and to request for a tour guide.They are open to accommodate tourists over night in their huts.
Tam-awan Village,overlooking and feel the fog on top of th viewdeck
Tam-awan Village,...miss the place. brief but worth it.
Tam-awan Village,Good walking shoes required. Have a picture of you and someone on your phone. A nice lady will sketch it and she does a nice job
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-awan. Vantage Point. Overlooking. This is a nic place where you get to catch a glimpse of the rich culture and tradition of Benguet. The artworks are so pleasing to the eyes and heart. Busog na yung eyes mo, nakapag-exercise ka pa as you roam around elevated spots. I think it would be better if may tourist guide kayo na idedeploy per batch, para mas ma-explain yung ibang spots and hindi ma-out of track. That's it!"
Tam-awan Village,"Best time to go there is during sunny season (if you wish to hike uphill),  the pathways are slippery during wet season (take extra care and watch your steps when walking)."
Tam-awan Village,A place of modern and traditional culture
Tam-awan Village,"Better not to include this place in your  tour, because its far from other spots and nothing to see here, only huts.And there is an entrance fee plus its not good for elders."
Tam-awan Village,The place and art exhibits are fascinating. It wad just raining when I visited so we were not able to roam outdoor trails.
Tam-awan Village,We went hear when it was raining so hard! I say that it gave an eerie feel which made me feel more appreciative for nature. The place is good.
Tam-awan Village,🙂 I cant say anything much
Tam-awan Village,"OJTs as tourist guide r well trained and very pleasant, too. Learned quite a lot about d igorots' culture. The pasalubong items r quite pricey compared to other areas...."
Tam-awan Village,They showcase the traditiona and cultures of the different tribes in Cordillera.
Tam-awan Village,60 entrance fee for adult not worth it.
Tam-awan Village,Nice place to visit. Local youngsters the original indigenous dances on Saturday. Expected village of a bigger size though.
Tam-awan Village,The best place to stay in Baguio. You'll sleep to an Ifugao hut and wake up to a cold foggy morning. Then eat your breakfast with a great view of the neighborhood below.
Tam-awan Village,A place where you can learn as it showcase local heritage.
Tam-awan Village,"The artists haven in the sky. Known for its authentic Cordillerian huts and its internationally renown artists. Tam-Awan Village has art galleries, a restaurant that serves native dishes, and the native huts can be rented for the night or a week stay. Some notable artists you might encounter in the Village are John Frank Sabado, Art Lozano and Jordan Mango-san."
Tam-awan Village,nice place for whole family to go to.
Tam-awan Village,"A reproduction of the Village of the Natives,Wherein,The roads are accessible only by humans but not of gasoline fed vehicle,Prepare for somekind of short hiking skills."
Tam-awan Village,Art + nature adventure  very nice place. And the food on thier cafe/restaurant is very delicious. But the place is not really commuters' friendly as well

Tam-awan Village,Great place for pinikpikan and brewed coffee!
Tam-awan Village,"A place for art enthusiast,but very limited parking space."
Tam-awan Village,Nice person nice venue and friends get to see again and foggy while at the place.

Tam-awan Village,so cool and cute❤️❤️❤️
Tam-awan Village,"If you're ready for a quick and educational tour, head out to Pinsao Proper and visit this very unique place, Tam-Awan Village. I paid less than a hundred at the entrance area and then they will provide you a tour guide. It was a very educational trek for me. The tour guide Chester, made sure that I am safe while we're up and down the stairs, (I was just wearing my leather sandals that time, wasn't expecting that it will rain, it was slippery) he brought me to the gallery then to the different huts that was used by the Ifugao people ages ago. It was a fun way of learning, and the view up above was breath taking. There's a cafeteria inside the village and before I went to my next destination, I got myself some souvenirs from their Souvenir Shop. If you'll visit the place, wear sneakers and put on some insect repellent."

Tam-awan Village,"A decent place among many attractions in BaguioNothing to see other than dance performancesThere are no handrails in many places during the climbing process. Although the climb is short (20 minutes slow), the road is slippery, so be careful."
Tam-awan Village,"These mountains were the land of the Igorot tribes.This Igorot ethnographic village is well organized for sightseeing.The village is tiny and very collected, perched on a rather steep mountain side, surrounded by very lush and colorful vegetation.The 11th Tam-Awan Arts Festival recently took place and traditional works are mixed with modern onesThere are several wooden huts with water-repellent thatched roofs.Next to each hut / work there are plaques that illustrate the ethnic / artistic context.There is a wedding hut, for the honeymoon, on stilts, with a special 'do not disturb' tinsel too.Mirrors are hung on a driveway with the aim of representing past, present and future… beyond that, a scarecrow.However, the rooms are small and getting around is not easy."
Tam-awan Village,"The place is cool and has many trees, traditional dance with unspoiled terraced paths like being lost in a forest."
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-Awan Village. A must-visit spot in Baguio. You must have a photographer with you to make your gala worthwhile. And for those who love coffee, you can have coffee at their restaurant. Their salad is delicious. Bastaaaaa it's good here, there's more good food. go with friends!"
Tam-awan Village,"It was beautiful here, the design of nature and the simple means of life is beautiful, the large pond with its koi carp is also wonderful. It is recommended to make a stop and eat some toast, which tasted very tasty and the fries were very tasty. It is recommended to wear sturdy shoes when complaining about Tam-awan Village.It was beautiful here, the design of nature and the simple means of life is beautiful, the large pond with its koi carp is also wonderful.

Tam-awan Village,"100 pesos by taxi from downtown BaguioAdmission is 60 pesos, but there is nothing special to see.There is a short hiking course and the air is very good because it is a mountain."
Tam-awan Village,"Nice art works. The ambience is super relaxing. Their mascot Hydro the cat is also cute, Suplado nga lang, 😁"
Tam-awan Village,"For 60 pesos per head, these are goods. You will also get tired because the trails are not flat. Of course, when it rains, the other stairs are slippery. The dance they did was also good."
Tam-awan Village,"If you can only go to one place in Baguio, I recommend it here.bamboo forest walktraditional performanceExhibition of local artistsview from higheverything is great"
Tam-awan Village,"Location:Expectation Vs. Reality, It's a waste of 60 pesos here.Parking:Don't bring a car here, the jeep is easy to get there, if you go it's near Burnham Park on Kayang Street.Experience:There's nothing to lose, so don't give up if you can avoid it :)"
Tam-awan Village,Here you will find ancient igorot houses and unique paintings
Tam-awan Village,"It is still a must see place around Baguio. If you're going to the Igorot Stone Kingdom, pass by it too. Someone performs Igorot dances. The ambiance in the area is different and you can even do a quick hiking/trekking. There is also a small souvenir store that is very unique compared to the Generic Baguio Souvenir stores around."
Tam-awan Village,Where to visit Baguio. Admission fee P50.Like the Aboriginal Culture and Art Village.There is a nice restaurant next to it!
Tam-awan Village,"Great outdoor activity. Watch out for trails because they are slippery. But if you are alone, it's okay ... you know what's left. 😄"
Tam-awan Village,Nice place..nkakarelax..
Tam-awan Village,It gives you that feeling of where and how our fellow Filipinos and our culture began. Such a nice place especially if you love history.
Tam-awan Village,Entrance is 10 pesos
Tam-awan Village,Fine Arts Center Paintings and the story of the people of the place and the roads and heights of nature Hallelujah
Tam-awan Village,"Although the place is small, there are people like Taiwan performing here. It ’s very interesting.Dance is almost XDDD like a nightclub like Golden KalalengIn addition, the chicken legs in the restaurant are delicious"
Tam-awan Village,Very relaxing and you can really see a glimpse of the native lives. It's just that it's hard to climb because it's all stairs and it's steep and slippery because there are rocks and moss. but all in all it's still a good place to visit
Tam-awan Village,A good place to take a stroll.
Tam-awan Village,nice place.. the food is delicious
Tam-awan Village,"A beautiful heritage village, I highly recommend visiting it"
Tam-awan Village,"👏👏👏👏👏 nice , it's a shame it was slippery when we went We didn't get to hike"
Tam-awan Village,"The place is okay. I just have your feet ready because there are many stairs HAHAHHAHAH. Lots of art works and plants, the area is small, so limit your expectations hehehe"
Tam-awan Village,The place is beautiful. It's good to go on a weekday so there aren't too many people. ❤
Tam-awan Village,"Enjoy being ready for a hike., Hahaha. There is a student tour guide if you want to assist"
Tam-awan Village,In case of rain or high humidity necessarily wear non-slip shoes. Interesting excursion point.
Tam-awan Village,to ngy😊 males
Tam-awan Village,"I love nature and Tam-awan is one of the places you can go to relax with adventure.And if you are an art lover, you will appreciate the painting collection they have."
Tam-awan Village,Love here
Tam-awan Village,Nice place to take a leisurely stroll.A place where you can have the feeling of a jungle for a while.
Tam-awan Village,"We hiked with senior citizen we were surprised to climb faster than us .. We were under estimate to mother ... It was easy to climb cases with a wet part ""the slippery slope"" hahaha .. The beauty of native houses seems I'm back in my teens .. Free!"
Tam-awan Village,"It's nice to go around here, although when I went there, there was absolutely nothing."
Tam-awan Village,"only three stars, because it is a bit far from Baguio town, and the views are limited, so it's not too good to climb the mountain because it's steep and tedious and it looks like nothing good can be seen at the top, just good to go because the paitings can be seen immediately. Also the huts, if you have time to wander around, it's okay to go to this place"
Tam-awan Village,It is very beautiful and has many beautiful adventures
Tam-awan Village,Postmodern style accommodation.A great experience for everyone who wants to experience something far away from normal accommodation and want to be close to nature. Also functions as an exhibition for regional artists.
Tam-awan Village,Tired of climbing the trail. Hope you have a gazebo or chair in VIewdeck 2 to relax. The railings would have been given to Viewdeck 2 because some of the older people would have climbed it but had stopped because it didn't seem to be in danger. (the disease bes)4 stars still due to ifugao huts and artworks.
Tam-awan Village,"A must visit place when in Benguet. There's a gallery if you're an art lover, there are groups of people performing indigenous Cordillera dances, and you can also try a little bit of hiking to complete the experience."
Tam-awan Village,The place is like a small furrowWhere the roads are very small wandering through it full of quarrelsOverall beautiful and terrible atmosphereFor those who are mainly located in Baki they deserve a visitThere is no foodEither if you cut a long distance do not recommend it
Tam-awan Village,"Even if you take a leisurely look around a section of the mountainside, the life of the indigenous people is reproduced in a course of about 30 minutes. There are original souvenirs not found in Baguio City."
Tam-awan Village,Beautiful
Tam-awan Village,Very colorful!))
Tam-awan Village,Very bad. The parking lot is muddy. It's always there. It's not always. It's advertised. Very risky
Tam-awan Village,Nature and art lovers will love the place. I am hoping to fix the defects or make it better for more to go.
Tam-awan Village,Several huts spread over the hill. Interesting descriptions. A bit of a climb. Pleasant experience.
Tam-awan Village,"A beautiful place, an old garden, a lot of beautiful things, and an opportunity to make a portrait for yourself in the tourist city of Baguio, Philippines"
Tam-awan Village,Happy PNK manga taga dating daan. Thank GodThe view is beautiful and it's my place to sleep free ercon

Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Interesting to look at, challenging to finish looking at unless you're used to trekking. There's much walking and climbing on both left and right sides, and it's not suitable for seniors. The angle of inclination for its slope appears to be retained as is that's why it's tough.The left side from the entrance uses a lot of stones and looks rural while the right side has lesser stones and is like a western-inspired castle exterior. If you choose the left side first, you'd get tired, so better to choose the right side first. It's the side with proper stairs and the tunnel with stones painted like gold. The statues on this side look nice.The left side has a way of sparking your imagination. There are also references to Philippine folklore on this side especially on the gods.What's bothered me on the stone side was the lack of safety precautions in the area. The fence is barely there and is quite flimsy, the stair stone steps tiny, and if you slip, that's a super long way down!This left side has the Igorot costume fitting for a fee of 50 pesos for pictorial and several good photo spots for the view.They also have official photographers in the area who print the photo for a fee of 250 pesos when we came to ask.It's worth a visit, but do take your time, it can't be climbed and finished so quickly if you're easily tired. Rushing this place would spoil the experience."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It was my first time here and I think it's a really nice place. It's great to see this amazing stone temple giving people some bits of history about the Igorot tribe. Good for picture taking but you must be brave enough to climb to the top to appreciate this beautiful picturesque.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I personally admired the effort put into constructing this kingdom of stone. They deserve the visit. We really enjoyed taking photos of the stone structures that appear like stair-like terraces. It gives you a glimpse of history of the Igorot communities. With the actual houses and garden, this is a must see!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The spot is still developing as it was made during pandemic. Some parts of it were not yet finished, workers are seen while visitors are in. The rate per person is 100 pesos. I think it’s a bit pricey but, it’s understandable as it is a privately owned tourist spot."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Entrance fee is Php100. Pretty crowded during the mid of the day. Great place to do a  hike.  A good place for photography because of it’s unique structure and architecture. After a 30-minute to an 1 -hour of walking, some variety of storesare available outside the kingdom for snack and drinks. A comfy pair of  shoes are advisable because there’s a lot of walking/hiking to see the other unique parts of the kingdom."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"View is beautiful. It is a stone throw tourist attraction from our relative's house so we went there as early as 7AM. Because the place gets packed by 8AM onwards, especially on holidays and weekends. Good for picture taking and learning bits about Igorot History. Entrance fee as of May 2022 is 100.00 per person. Parking space is a bit tight but there are few pay parking around. Transient houses are available near the area, too. Best to go as early as 6:30 AM so the place do not have much people yet."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Such an amazing sight to see! This place is built from stone, by hand I was told. I can’t imagine the time and hard work put into this location. This is a must see in Baguio if you have the opportunity. We stayed a couple of hours here and took some wonder pictures. Even as crowed as it was, people were polite and very patient. I would love to revisit here if I come back to Baguio."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Open, but few areas still under construction. Good to visit in the morning sunrise. Good for pictures but the same stone background everywhere just different structures.Few shaded areas and amenities."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A beautiful and a must visit place when you go to Baguio City. Kids and adults will surely love this place. Not advisable for senior citezens though especially to those who have difficulty walking  and climbing up and down the stairs. The place is not fully finished yet.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A very beautiful place. It gets too busy on weekends, rain or shine. I hope in they control the flow of people inside and remove the shops/stores from the highlight spots.Nevertheless, I will definitely come back."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is still under construction and the entrance fee is affordable. I would like to see specific routes on my visit (tourist movement was a bit chaotic last time). I would also like to see the stores moved out of the grounds and closer to the ticketing office so there's less crowding. Overall, it was a good experience, and I enjoyed learning more about the Igorot culture through the placards near the photo opp sites."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,If you are looking for a new place to explore in Baguio then this is the perfect place for you. Entrance fee is 100 for adults and 80 for kids. Foods and drinks are available inside. Best time to visit is during weekdays and in the morning when there are only a few tourists going there.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,we visited while the weather wasn't good so it's really a struggle can't take selfies cos it's raining especially the site is a wide open. my legs hurt from climbing the steep stairs—that's my own problem. the site is still on going. there's allotted time for tickets. you can buy raincoats if it's raining. there's street food inside—located at the top called sunset view. expect the parking is just alongside the road. restrooms are not that fine. but great experience!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"We visited when the place was engulfed in fog and it made it all the more surreal. It's like being in a historical fantasy movie.Although not yet completely finished, thus the 4 stars for room for improvement, it is a worthwhile place to visit. A bit of a climb but that's a given in Baguio. Could use a history gallery to highlight the pride and significance of the culture. All in all a good trip. Will revisit once thoroughly completed."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place to visit especially in the afternoon when it gets so foggy! The entrance fee is 100 for adults and 80 for children and senior citizen. kids 3 yrs old and below are free. They also offer food and drinks below the view deck. I hope that the place will always be well-kept.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"One of the new tourist attraction in La Trinidad, Benguet, amazing work of the local and some says it is handmade by themSome areas are still work in progressParking is one of the problem if you travel with your own car, drop-in and pick-up in front of the place is a good idea. Parking space inside and infront of the place is available but to limited upto 10-12 cars only. Parking space around the place is also available but due to the out-pouring tourist, you should have luck and good timing to park; parking along the road will get you a traffic violation ticket.Foods inside is available and also some outside"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is in development for further enhancements as of the moment of this review. Though that's the case the place is already great. Before entering the place you must pay the ticket fee first. 100 pesos for adults, 80 pesos for children and free for toddlers. After paying the ticket you need to show it to be stamped before you can enter. Inside the area, after entering through,you can have a picture with a big dog for a hundred (100.00) pesos per set which means per group or per person but many pictures can be taken - you need to give your phone to the photographer then have your friends or yourself, if you're alone, ready for the photo shoot. Food and drink stalls are available inside. You can also rent an igorot outfit for 50 pesos and have photo sessions inside the premises only - kindly return the outfit before you leave. There is also an amazing band - South America Bolivia, which plays a native flute together with several music pieces, kindly give him a tip or two if you please. It's a great experience. I haven't visited the igorot mine inside because I was so hungry and needed to eat and forgot about it 😅."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"This is one of the newer attractions in Baguio which highlights the stone-building skills of the Igorots. For a small fee, one could experience firsthand this marvel. Before entering, one could have a photo taken garbed in the Igorot costume complete with a headdress. Two giant statues of native Igorots are by the entrance. As a senior citizen, my climbing skills were challenged, so to speak 😂. Young people would love this place. One is afforded a truly exhilarating view on the upper tiers. This is a must-see when you visit."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice view especially from the top. You will be amazed by the structure and the story how it was built.Additional attraction when you visit Baguio....Would recommend that they put up some shelters when it rains or under the heat of the sun for quite some time....
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"₱100 entrance fee/ticketAs of today, I've read an article that it was ordered to closed over violations such as safety issues and operating with no business permit.Maganda sya kaso violation is a violation.And it's better to take action now bago pa may mangyaring masama. Ang dami pa naman ding bumibisita."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Though its man made but its also unique. People could flock and experience walking through stairs of stones and cement. Nice looking view down on people walking below.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"its just a fancy place with no account about history. just a way to rip off money from tourist. if you want to enjoy baguio. go in the outskirts of the city enjoy nature,, enjoy the natural parks"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A new tourist attraction in Baguio. It features the ancient rip-rap technology of the Igorots and the present day concrete retention wall approach. Intagramable and selfie/groupie spots. Php 100 pesos entrance fee. Php 80 pesos for seniors. You can rent the traditional Igorot  costume for 50 pesos for unlimited time. And take photos with it around the area. With minimal parking slots. Restrooms are available in the entrance lounge. Souvenir, street food snacks and strawberry and ube ice cream cart are available.  Expect climbing up and down as part of the experience."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Highly recommended place to visit when in Baguio. It adds to the common tourist spots that are overcrowded already. Just pray that the rain does not caught up with you as it may ruin your opportunity to get and capture great pictures of the place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The Igorot Kingdom just opened in June 2021 and if you are into hiking or walking, then this is definitely a pla there for you to start your tour in Baguio!Parking is difficult. Either infront of the attraction, roadside or at Petron (to which you have to walk back a around 280m with the cars right beside you).There are 4 attractions here: First, stone walls which was inspired by rice terrace;  second, the Igorot Gold Mine; steel bridge; and modern-day castles made of cement and hollow blocks. There are other on-going developments in the area.At the stone walls, the pathway is almost good for one person only and is a two-way path. Hopefully they improve the flow of people so as not to interrupt those moving up and going down from the top. It will be better to have a one-way system especially that people stop to take photos.The pathway around the modern day castle is wide enough to accommodate two-way system. A floor before the 360 overview is a mini canteen with refreshments. The over360 view was worth the steps! It was relaxing and refreshing."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Not for the faint hearted, there are ramps for parents wanting to bring their little ones on top yet uneven terrain makes the travel difficult. Be sure to wear RUBBER SHOES for comfort. The diner on top of the structure is just quail egg or kwek x2, drinks and snacks so don't expect lavish meals since you only paid for the scenery and view. My advice would be to go to the gray or castle like structure for a better view rather than the rocky side."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Place had a quite pleasant view. Though there will be alot of walking and climbing to the highest peak of the attraction it is worthwhile. You can also rent Igorot clothes costume then take a selfie to make you feel the vibe of being an Igorot even better. It is well maintained and as of our visit last March improvements still are on the way for more attractions. PS there was a food court on the almost top of the attraction on the right side peak :). Only problem you can encounter though when going weekends would be the parking as there might be alot of tourist nothingless all is good.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Looks okay but too crowded. Came here on a weekday but there are oh so many tourists. Some pathways are just too narrow for 2 people passing at the same time not to mention ongoing construction during visiting hours in the middle of the pathways which makes it more narrow. Also, some paths can be too steep for senior citizens. Andddd, it's so hard to take a decent photo. If you want to visit, they're open as early as 6am. Visit early to avoid the crowd. I wouldn't visit again unless maybe after the construction's finished or if they control the number of people inside. Entrance fee is 100 pesos."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Wonderful place to visit. So amazed on how they were able to build the stone structures. Just a heads-up that there is an entrance fee that we need to settle before we get in. A portion of it also allows you to have pictures with our native people, a dog and there is also a space where in you can ask for a hena tattoo session. On right side is likely a kingdom that has different windows os a castle then there is a bridge that connects to the left side of it where you will see the staircases of stones. Please be reminded that if we are bringing kids with us, make sure to always look after them to avoid accident's."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Love the view and the architectures. However, I heard from the news that they were closed down by the government as of November 9,2022. The same day we visited. Please double check before you visit."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Needs a lot of work. It will look good once it's fully finished. Hope they  will also fix the road since Baguio has a lot of rainfall and it will be muddy. Also entrance fee is a bit pricey
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Another new attraction in  Baguio. If you're planning to visit, be there early cause parking is limited. Entrance fee for seniors and and seniors are discounted and paid at the registration area. It features safety rails to assist visitors in climbing the stones. It features the skills of the igorots in building ripraps which is  much like the famous rice terraces. Its still a work in progress. More levels are still being added. One can rent igorot costumes for a fee. Be sure to wear sunblock before visiting."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,When youre looking for some cardio exercise in the City of Pines.There are better sites to visit in Baguio but this attraction boasts of its creativity and construction skills of locals.Parking space is limited and so is the public transport.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The Igorot Stone Kingdom offers a unique and beautiful concept. It’s one of the most attractive tourist spots in the city.  For 50 pesos, tourists may rent costumes and dress up like Igorots while sightseeing. Official photographers are also present in the area. You may claim your pictures near the entrance for 150 pesos."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Newly build and still under construction for the most part. It showcases the indigenous culture of Cordilleras, as well as the practices, traditions, values and way of life of its people. Insta worthy place.Let down is they should have finished the construction before opening it for the public, not a pleasant experience to walk in-between gravel-cement mixture. No proper signage to guide you thru the entire stone kingdom. Lack of dustbins, in the floor, rest area and almost everywhere you might see litters candy covers, chocolate covers, not the way to respect indigenous culture by polluting the place. They should add a guide for the tourists to get deeper understanding in the tradition, beliefs and to answer basic question  for the full experience and knowledge abt the culture.If you are travelling by taxi, make sure you will be leaving before 5pm as it is very hard to get a taxi or grab taxi after 5pm, as the place is kinda outside of the busy zone and the taxis that frequent this area is not that many.Ticket rates as of may 2022:Adult: 100 PesoChildren age 3-12: 80 PesoOverall a nice try and improvements can be done."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"With its gates opening in June 2021, the Igorot Stone Kingdom is one of the latest attractions in this part of Benguet.It is a man-made theme park that highlights the culture of the indigenous tribes in the Cordillera Region. According to owner Pio Velasco, this 6,000-square meter area is where he exactly saw a white carabao. He used it as an inspiration to build the structure there.The site is easily noticeable from a distance. It looks like a castle ruin from a bird’s eye view. The walls are made with stones interlocked together with cement for additional strength.The fully constructed parts of the attraction include the fertility tower as well as statues of Igorot legends Kabunyan, Gatan, and Bangan. There’s also a section that depicts a gold mine, a steel bridge, and a modern-looking castle. You can have a photo taken with the resident Igorots there.At the top of the castle is a canteen-like store where you can buy food and refreshments. There are also stalls selling goods and pasalubong.As of August 2022, there are still parts under construction, so you could expect more life-sized statues and other features soon. Regardless, tourists still flock to this destination, especially during weekends. It’s best to visit the place on a weekday morning to avoid the rush of visitors.This new bucket list item is located along Longlong Road in Pinsao Proper, roughly five kilometers from the city’s center. It’s also a stone’s throw away from the Tam-awan Village.Aside from taking a private vehicle, you can get here via jeepney by riding the Longlong- or Tam-Awan-bound jeep from Kayang Street. However, taking a taxi, Grab, or InDriver ride is more convenient.Getting back to the city proper is a bit challenging. There’s a queue outside the attraction for passengers needing a taxi ride back.The Igorot Stone Kingdom is open every day, from 6 AM to 6 PM. Here’s the list of entrance fees:Adults (at least 13 years old): P100Children (4-12 years old): P80Kids (3 years old and below): FreeSenior citizens and PWDs get a discount."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Entrance fee is costly,   what you see is what you get , in photo and in actual..  No particular superb in this place,  too crowded  because its the new attraction  here in bagiuo..  But again no extravagant  feature,  only they said that the true history  of igorot stone house was vanished  sometime ago.  . And know they just remake it.√® i paid my entrance  fee,  i rated based on my experience. 😊"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A lot of families visit this place... you can rent  set of native costume and have your pictures taken.Worth the price of entrance (P100/pax).
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"❌ Entrance Fee is quite expensive. P100 per adult!✔️ Igorot Flute Man is really great. Watch him play and spare some tip please!✔️ Mom loved this place. She was amazed so yeah. 😅Note: As of Dec. 26, 2021, some facilities are not yet finished."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Good site for pictures, unique place to visit...still under construction...owner of place wanted to show physically what it was like during those days....if completed we will go back and check God willing"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"They say that there is life in stone. I agree. This huge monument of stones is breathtaking. Although it is new, but the history is old and alive. The architecture is somewhat similar to Indonesia."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,An awesome place to visit with loved ones. I love how peaceful the place is especially in the morning. It made me appreciate more the hard working people of the highland. A must visit place for nature lover 💚🌳  ⛰
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Igorot Stone Kingdom is one of the newest attraction in Baguio. Very Instagram-worthy and this is the place where your hd widescreen cameras gets handy because of their 360° views are picture perfect.There are also budget-friendly stores around for souvenirs and picture taking ( Php50.00 unli shots)The other stone kingdom where there are restrooms and food stalls are stroller friendly. However, the other stone kindom is steeper and has a lot of stairs and not stroller friendly but the view and lighting is much better.Entrance fee is Php 100.00 for adults, Php 70.00 for studenta (just present a school id).Parking is well provided. Commuting is easier since taxis are always present in the area.Nearby places includes the Tam-Awan Village which is walking distance from this place."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Parking is kind of hassle coz you will be called out via mega mic when there's parking issue. And more hassle, if you happened to be at the top.They have 100 pesos entrance fee.The steps are slippery and not recommended for wheelchair."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I got amazed with the story telling behind its construction and the vision on how this project  would go about. Stop by and read the signage around, its educating and beautifully worded that easily captures the imagination.Be awed with the  igorot workmanship and creativity at the Igorot Stone Kingdom"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It is what it is. This is basically just a roadside attraction.  It looks cool, but there's really no historical significance.  It was constructed because ""On this site on March 1,2020 a white carabao appeared before Pio G. Velasco (Igorot name: Bagowan).""It does have some pretty good street food. Also, as others have mentioned,  parking is a huge challenge."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"This place is recently built on baguio, i think its 95% done but there is still some construction on going, a good place to visit and you can climb at the very top of the castles I like it in here even if its kinda tiring because of all the climb we need to do, also there is like a caves or places with notes on it about some history or ancient gods of mountain tribes."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Nice but it's not finished yet.Also to add, very limited parking space. So you have to resort to nearby private parking spaces that will charge you 100 pesos."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place was really nice. Sobrang daming tao lang that time na pumunta kami. There are still some construction inside and outside the place. The food was kinda expensive for it's size and qty, and sana expand yung place for eating."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Stone. Stone. Stone everywhere. Well, it's a Stone kingdom--- it shows the brief culture of the igorots and one thing I love in this place is their pasalubong area(where they aCcepted our gcash payment cause we're out of cash lol) and my friends enjoyed climbing it, they also have a cafe in the new building. You can check it out, it's a breath of fresh air. The entrance fee is 100php."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Igorot Stone Kingdom. Located in Baguio City.This is a nice place to stop by. You can rent Igorot traditional clothing for only PHP50.Climb into the Top to experience overlooking view. There is also a Cafe and Snack bar on the Top.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It is still under development but the place is already spectacular. It is the top place I recommend when visiting the highlands of Baguio and Benguet. It is one of the works of my kababayan (kailyan) that I am proud of. It has a taste of the rich culture of us Igorots. Our first visit here was actually raining and it was so thoughtful that they have given us free entrance tickets of which we used during our recent visit of this place. Enjoy barbeque and street foods located at the top most part of this park. Value for the entrance fee (P100php for adult I think) is 5/5. Parking can accommodate many cars. Enjoy your stay and hope you will like it.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It is good... But this month June 2022 there are still renovation happening insidw the Stone kingdom. If you want to buy food, there are stores but make sure to prepare enough allowance. The entrance fee costs 100 pesos and the parking lot too."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Great workout if you are into climbing stairs while enjoying the view. Entrance fee is affordable and you can buy souvenirs here.We learned so much about the life of the igorot tribe, wish that the local government will continue to support this attraction and develop signages and other amenities."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Place is still under active development. Smaller in actual vs pictures but is no less than a beaut to visit.Just be wary that you can get exhausted just by climbing up the area. lol.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Really admired the effort put into constructing this kingdom of stone. They deserve the interest of people visiting Baguio.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Looking for a new place? Visit ISK. newly made. Place is still under construction but view is nice. Expect more visitors. 100 pesos fee for adults and 80 pesos for kids.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"New attraction to go. Since it's new, expect a lot of tourists. Good thing there were authorities outside to mitigate the crowd."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"You'll have to take a lot of staircases so it's better to wear comfy shoes and clothes. It's kinda hard to go here on a rainy day, and it's extra windy, so you better bring a rain coat than an umbrella."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Just stones and shops. Not much history here. Most are fantasies made real by the owner. It's great exercise though for 100 pesos. Slippery when wet. Limited parking and always packed with people.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I don't know if they have the map of the place, on going construction of the site.Railings are too thin, unlike in Mirador. So be careful and do not lean on it."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It was good, though construction is being done on both sides but is not affecting the flow of people that much. Great for taking pictures"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice structural designs~ although we didn't see the view bec of the fog. Lots of photo op and also pet-friendly!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Very nice place to go, you can see Cultural beliefs and traditional attire that can wear for picture taking. 100.00 entrance fee is worth the experience ☺️"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Great place. Breathtaking view. Great architecture. Need to work on more and fix the rest rooms. There's only one for the whole place and you get thousands of tourists everyday. Parking is a bit of a challenge and arriving here is a bit of a headache due to the congestion. There's a noticeable lack of public transport in the entirety of Baguio and is mostly populated by taxis.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Amazing architecture, two different styles of castle, love the view and weather, ooohh the fog! 100 pesos entrance fee per head, a bit crowded though"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A new attraction at Baguio City. A man-made Igorot Stone Kingdom still with a ticket worth of 100 pesos. Despite there being some ongoing construction in the said place, the area is still worth it for your instagram."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It’s not recommended for wheelchair/ senior citizen who hardly to walk, since lots of stair to going up.Entry ticket: ₱100 for adult, ₱80 senior, kids below 4 are freeThe place is so crowded and there is picture station who will gave us some props for free (only donation)."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Great! Some work is being done when we visited. Really impressive as it seems that every rock/stone is custom-shaped by hand.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Too crowded place but still we enjoyed staying there. I’ve seen like these place before when i was still working in saudi arabia.Nice place’nice people too👌🏼😊
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"100 pesos per head entrance fee. It's a gem in the middle of a residential area. Not recommended for people with weak knees. Ive noticed that there is a ramp for PWDs which is great. Pero available lang sya sa loob and not sa entrance so idk how they are going to get inside. Parking space are limited. There is a small cafe and eatery at the top. Overall, it's very beautiful."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Awesome man made structure. Beautifully arranged all the things. Little bit describe about igorot people . 100 peso enterace fee per person
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"1) terrible car park attendant, had my 5month old kid and a senior getting off the car , and he just said to hurry it up on a serious tone or put the car on the other side where there is traffic in between, he even was bragging about having a feast fight! tried to report to the admin he just brushed it off....2) P 100 entrance not that cheap so be ready to shell some money3) no parking space , better to go there on a taxi or better yet dont go at all , not a picturesque place.....since this is a private institution customer service should be a premium ...... wont recommend this place at all"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not pleasant at all. It's a private spot wherein it was created purely for business. Nothing special except to climb the stairs that lead to the topmost level of these man-made stone terraces. Everything is for a fee. Very small parking and food are expensive.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The creativity and craftiness of the builders are commendable. Better to visit this place in summer to enjoy the 360 view.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,When in Baguio:Visited the Igorot Stone Kingdom. One of the recently added tourist spots in Baguio. Rich in history. Great for uphill downhill walking but one must have good stamina lol.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Glad to know this place was built as a safe space for Igorots and to showcase their amazing building prowess. Definitely a must-see attraction in Baguio.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Definitely, creative. A bit unsafe due to protruding metals. Construction is ongoing without warning signs. Date of visit May 5, 2022."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A new tourist destination that tells about Igorot folklore and showcases the locals' rock-laying skills. The park covering a 6,000-square meter area features the Igorot ingenuity in creating stone walls similar to the rice terraces in Battad, Banaue."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The scenery and construction are amazing....bravo to the architects, engineers and all who are part of creating the Igorot Stone Kingdom."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Update Sept 22: I stopped by this place today. It still looks much like a construction site from the inside. I am forever baffled how local governments can approve opening attractions that are still construction sites. 1) Railings throughout are a joke, were not even installed or are temporary rebar. There must not be any regulation on what a railing should be in a venue with many fall opportunities, esp for children. 2) this venue does not appear to have ANY connection to Igorot anything accept the owner (Private owner braggs he had a dream he would be rich, so he installed a huge tourist trap, BTW not supporting anything nobel but his pockets) is apparently Igorot. The few already badly faded and worn signs claiming to make connections to Irogot heritage are a side show. 3) This is nothing more then a Disney-fied Instagramable bunch of rocks emulating some kind of European Castle aesthetic.  4) Finally, i would bet they don't report honest revenue to BIR. You don't get a receipt. They issue the whole ticket from a book. There are no ledgers or registers. Tickets are preferated but the gate takes the whole ticket. They go in a big box. Nice to burn, so there is no record of any sales anywhere. Please don't waste your 100 pesos. Have lunch at Farmer's Daughter and move on! See some art at Tamawan. For real don't waste your tme here!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Igorot Stone Kingdom.They have this food court. Unfortunately, they dont serve their local cuisine, which he indicated his favorite bean stew. How i wish they serve this gastronome art in this place.update: i found an eatery where you can find the Pork and bean but without the pork mentioned.As per my palate, the taste is interesting. I havent tsted it before, in my opinion its a must try if you go to Baguio, also this is where the best tasting Adobong Puso ng saging according to my senses.The kitchen can be found just beside the Baguio Townhouse condomiun. ""Mama Dins Bulalohan at kambingan sa kanto"""
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A nice place but not advisable to elders. Theres a coffee shop on the top that serves merienda, and a small eatery at the entrance."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I enjoyed being here and you will pay 100 for entrance fee, less 20 for kids. If you like to experience the stone filing by igorot and Igorot culture and environment. This is a yes-yes suggestion!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,So many people means it is a famous place since it is also a new attraaction to baguio city. The entrace fee is okay. Even though its still nit finnish but it still looks fabulous and safety to roam around .
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Place is really nice. A bit far lang sya sa baguio proper. I suggest na magdala bg car coz public transport in this area is not that easy. Hehehh. Though there are few taxi's naman. You just need to wait.Di pa tapos yung place when we went there. But youll see already how beautiful the place is.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New place to visit in Baguio. 15 to 20 mins away from Sm Baguio. Must visit this romantic place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Its a very nice place many tourist even it's under construction still you can enjoy the view very accommodating people they have.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The php100 is not really worth it because the place is not yet finished. However, the place is nice because it has postings about the history of Igorot’s."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Awesome stack of rocks with igorot statues.With cafe/canteen on the top and a viewing deck.Crowded when we came here (Saturday Afternoon)We came here with a cab but I noticed that parking area is small.P100 entrance fee for adults.Update: Nov 9 it is closed due to permit and safety issues.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It is still half done. The right side is still being constructed as of this moment but still worth your time.Just a few reminders:- few minutes away from Session rd/SM but can be longer due to traffic.- Situated beside a four-lane main road and a cause of traffic.- Parking space is very limited.- Jeepneys are available by chance and you need to guard your taxi before somebody else will take it from you.- Entrance fee for adults is ₱100.00.- Be careful of the rocks.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"So majestic & artistic. What a great idea, how lovely, isn't it? Well anyway, this place is perfect for your Baguio tour because it is near in tam-awan village, just a few walk ayaw.. There they are, my awesome guest all the way from bicol.. #Boy Bagito"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Beautiful View 🌁Nice weather❄Its like you're in the other country🌏
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Awesome place. A must not miss to visit place. Although parking is limited, the place is absolutely awesome."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New place to visit in Baguio. Quite far from the metro and entrance fee is kinda expensive knowing that area could be roam around in less than 30min.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's a nice place to visit. Construction and improvements on going at the moment. Nice view. Will go back again. You will be mesmirized and amazed on how they constructed it.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Incomplete and lots of people visiting daily. Didn’t stay long. Seems covid is too great a threat
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Super great place nice to see how the Igorot people do the place making more beautiful and more attractive to invite people to visit the place, for me salute to Igorot people"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Place is nice but they are not yet done constructing some areas so some areas are not yet photo-friendly 😁.For the future visitors, please be decent and have some respect, DON'T VANDALIZE!!!!When we went there we saw names written somewhere at the castle-like area!Please take only pictures, and leave only footprints! Imagine if every visitor will leave their names on the walls, that will be an eyesore!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A supposed-to-be picturesque place that got visually marred by a thick fog throughout our afternoon visit. But it is a good place to visit.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"One of the new attractions in Baguio. Entrance fee costs 100 per adult and 80 for children. Parking can be a challenge. Parking fees cost P25 for each car. The place has ongoing construction as of July 2021. If you're up for hiking and don't mind some skin-scorching, this place is okay. Otherwise, it is not worth visiting. There are still inaccessible areas due to construction. Food options are overpriced. Structures are all man-made and not historic. Social distancing is not well-enforced. Can get very inconvenient and even dangerous when it's raining."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place. Not much to do but take pics. So instgrammable.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Entrace fee is overpriced. Too much commercial, to less focus on Igorot culture and history. Good for photos."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"They were charging 100 pesos for regular adults and 80 pesos for seniors. A bit pricier than other Baguio tourist spots. Inside, the stone structure was impressive. I only went to one side, the finished side, of the kingdom. I was not confident in the structural integrity of the other half. It looked unfinished and it was just simple cement. Now it was closed by the city for not having a permit. Hoping they will fix their papers and finish the site. It was great for photos."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This is a man made park and one of the most tourist attractions in Baguio City. This Igorot Stone Kingdom is a rock laying skills of the Igorots.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A park that showcases Igorot culture, practices, and traditions as well as the life of the denizens of the Cordillera region. The owner's concept is an Igorot child's fantasy of castles, his childhood in Mountain Province, the stories about the first Igorot people, man's belief that there is a caring God, and the culture of the family accentuated by the Igorot's skillful hands of stone laying. Among the main attractions at the stone kingdom is a tower that depicts the fantasy story of Gatan and Bangan, an Igorot man and woman who survived the great holocaust, a fertility stone tower, and a Kabunyan (Igorot God) tower. The park is a representation of the new and old Igorot culture and values of the Cordillera people. Then we can see some proud Igorot playing local musical instruments which are so entertaining to see. They showcase their dexterity as artisans and entertainers. The wonderful visitors are having fun at the park. From distance, we can see an underground and a bridge which is a picturesque view. For this reason, we take many pictures and videos at the top. Indeed it is one of the must-visit places in Baguio City."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The journey to this place is so exciting... You may feel tired but the experience is incredible😊
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's a unique experience to be here while eating strawberry ice cream in the Baguio cold weather is

Igorot Stone Kingdom,"although it ain't complete yet when I visited, it is amazing to look at already. very accessible by commute if you will be coming from baguio town, only 1 jeep away, fare at 15php"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Nothing special, maybe it's more beautiful if it has more colors. Entrance fee is 100 and you will have free 1year pass because it's still under construction."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is clean, though it is under construction during our visit. There's food in the area. Best time to visit in the morning. Entrance fee is kind a expensive though for just a castle and stone."

Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Nice stepped and elevated place, for selfie and group pictures!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The entrance fee is unreasonable since there is nothing to do inside but take pictures. A minute after the initial shock of what the place looks like, I was over it. I didn't even want to go up the stairs if it wasn't that I have an energetic 8 yr old boy that wants to see every crevice of the place. If you had seen it once, it is not something you would want to view again."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place to visit. Still have areas under construction but there is enough to take nice pictures as remembrance. They could improve safety especially at heights. Good thing it was not running when I went. Be careful if it rains. Must be super slippery in some areas
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New attraction in Baguio. Dreamy and foggy. Enjoyed taking photos. Great experience!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Interesting tourist trap, great photo opportunity, good workout to walk around.A bit crowded, a little bit not child friendly since there's a lot climbing and possible places to easily fall if you don't watch your kid attentively.Very little parking though on-site so be prepared to hunt for a (pricey) parking spot in the nearby areas..."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Always crowded but it's fine since there's still places where you can sit down, rest and just enjoy the view.Too expensive for 100pesos and if you think about how many people go to this place maybe they really shouldn't be asking for more money on the used of costume like it should be included with the 100. But I guess people who do rent out the costume and sell stuff inside pays a for their stall or something.Maybe make it more worth your money kind of place."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Unique view and good for people who love the view of nature because u can see everything when your on the top of the igorot stone
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New attraction in Baguio with 100 pesos each entrance. THEY opens by 6am
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It was easy to find, the placd looks really cool, they are still developing the place, friendly people, you have to pay for the entrance for 100 pesos. You can also rent the Igorot clothing. Wear your comfortable shoe or walking shoe. It was kinda slippery to the other side."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Loved the place, the way the maintained and still taking care of it is good. Definitely worth a visit, rented indigenous clothing to take pictures and returned them back.An entry fees is to be paid per person."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Awesome place for pictures & stair climbing fitness exersize
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Good place to visit.Parking: look for nearby parking rental.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Additional features ongoing.. It's worth to visit. Better be prapared with water and lot of energy.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Interesting architecture. Just prepare your knees as you will go up. Nice view on top. Also, its better to go early as the parking spot gets easily full and to avoid crowding as well."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Amazing handiwork of the people of the cordillera. Great architecture, it may not be completed yet but you can  enjoy and appreciate how amazing it woould be when the works are completed.Better to come early  as early as 6am to avoid the influx of visitors/ tourists, limited parking space and if you arrive at the middle of the day it would be congested with people."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The kingdom is expanding adding more stones on the right side.. better visit this place around 3PM onwards to avoid crowds and appreciate the view of course.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Some of the areas are still under renovation on our visit but overall the place is a good tourist attraction
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice view and infrastructure. It's just crowded when we go there. Maybe because of the holiday.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I love this place so much..sulit ang 100 pesos entrance fee for adult and 80 pesos for children 4 years old to 12 years old..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The new tourist spot in baguio..its so amazing..luv it!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A good place for pictures. You can also rent igorot costumes.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"There is an indigenous creativity here. This place was probably borne out of the more than a year of lockdown by its maker. It is indeed amazing to see adjoining mountain slopes practically layered with stone walls on one side and concrete slabbed walkway that leads to a viewdeck on one side. In summation, this place is absolutely a must see when you happen to travel to this part of the country."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Igorot Stone Kingdom is one of the unique place we have ever been here in Philippines. I may say that we can be proud of our culture and natural resources. Travel now and visit this place not just because of the beautiful scenery but also the people are so loving, friendly and accommodating.Although it is still undergoing some improvements but still the place is amazing. This is a must visit if you will be going to Baguio City , Philippines."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Tiring but worth it because of the stones, hand rails can be improved to a much tougher one."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,What a historic man made structure. This is one  enermous beauty of man's  craftsmanship!. It exibits the igorots tenacity and pure craftsmanship. 5 stars!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is great. But there is no good resting area or shed especially when there is rain.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Might not have been a realistic stone kingdom but still facinated at how they come up with the idea and a touch of modern kingdom look.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"There were many people, and most of them were rowdy, undisciplined, not socially distancing, and not wearing masks like there was no covid or like the government wasn't mandating it when we were there last April 2022. Too bad because the place itself was interesting. The fog and views from the top were worth the climb. Limited parking."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It’s a great tourist destination in Baguio but the line of cars, vans and taxis going to that place is not worth the hassle.We’re lucky we got the chance to get there as early as 8:00 in the morning.Pro tip: When going to different attractions in Baguio, and you have the time from 7:00 - 9:00 am in your Itinerary, place the busiest places in that time frame. That could be Igorot Stone Kingdom, Strawberry Farm and Mines View."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Amazing place to enjoy relax have fun and hiking from bottom to top. And see the beautiful views around. Architectural designs are unique,stones they use."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It always looks good on pictures and hearsays but up front in personal it's a little underwhelming, the amount of people here and line queue for picture is a little unbearable"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Php 100 Entrance Fee (Sept 2022). Nice place to take pictures.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Beautiful tourist spot in Baguio I love it   
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Amazing construction of stone. Much more than ever expected this place is very big with two sides one all stones and one more of a cement construction.  We enjoyed very much. Recommend you go there and be prepared to walk a lot.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,An Igorot stone kingdom was A man made tourist attraction
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"EDIT: It’s CLOSED due to “permit and safety issues” until further notice. You may search it on Google.The place is good for picture-taking but we will not come back. There’s nothing special about it, in our opinion."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very cool place. Love it
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Good experience and beautiful views.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I.had fun w/ nieces..un pla ang igorot stone kingdom😍..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Entrance fee of 100php is a bit high for the place
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Place is very nice.But the entrance fee is too much (Php 100)Unfortunately, when we go there the fog is too thick and we cannot see that much.There is also limited parking space in the area (motorcycle parking is Php20)There is also food stalls outside and a cafe in the inside (on top of the building)"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"One of its kind. Make sure to go early for parking, because if it’s full, the properties beside it offer parking but they charge 100. Not wheelchair or stroller friendly though."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,How amazing is this kingdom built by Igorot from matching stones with little use of cement
Igorot Stone Kingdom,made only for tourists and money.  a lot of tourists.  I don't like these places
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's a good place though not much to see. Just stones and a lot of slope climbing. The place is still not finished when I got there, there were a few construction happening around."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Expectations versus reality. The place was teeming with people when we went there. It is hard to take a good photo of the STONE kingdom. May have some safety issues as there were scaffoldings in one area. Young children should not be left unsupervised.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Its a nice place for picture taking. Though its not advisable for old persons like our lolo s and lolas since there are a lot of walking and going up upstairs. There are food stalls before the entrance as well as food stalls at the upper part of the place. Entrance fee is 100 pesos for adults and 80 pesos for children. Though its hard to look for parking spaces and the parking fee is 100 pesos which is a little bit expensive considering that its open parking and has no roof. WARNING! YOU REALLY NEED TO PARK IN DESIGNATED PAY PARKING AREA SINCE WHEN WE WENT THERE LAST NOV. 1 I HAVE SEEN LOTS OF TRAFFIC ENFORCERS ISSUING TICKETS OR REMOVING PLATE NUMBERS FOR THOSE WHO DONT WANT TO PAY THE 100 PESOS PARKING FEE AND HAVE PARKED ILLEGALLY AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It wasca nice experience seeing those stones turned into something beautiful. However, since they are charging an entrance fee of Php100 (hope for a more reasonable price) they should improve the restrooms/ comfort rooms."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Still under progress... yet very promising tourist destination.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"New attraction for tourists, construction still in progress."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Lots of art and craft, so beautiful"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice new place and attraction in Baguio with 100 pesos entrance fee. There are paid parking spaces near the site but the one we got costed us 100pesos per vehicle. This is also close to the Tam Awan Village.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,On going construction/renovation of the beautiful place. Added attraction are the Igorots and St. Bernard dog. Be ready with your entrance fee.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Unique setting and good story behind the structure
Igorot Stone Kingdom,If you want to relax just visit igorot stone kingdom located at baguio city
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"This park also represents the creativity and rich heritage of the Igorots. It is said that the Igorots are skillful in balancing stones and creating sturdy structures. Aside from these representations, the Igorot Stone Kingdom shares valuable histories and backgrounds about their colorful culture. The Igorot Stone Kingdom is one of the newest man-made attractions in Baguio.Entrance Fee:Adult: P100Kids/Senior: P80"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Some part of the place was still under construction.  Enjoyed taking a photos at the main entrance but thats it. If you do not like climbing and walking a lot then this is not the place for you.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Beautiful but too crowded.not good for seniors
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Igorot stone kingdom is so beautiful to see,, it's amazing,.."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,One of the best new places to go in Baguio!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The best you can go and take pictures
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I rate only 1 star because I never been there inside. Temporarily closed at this time. The jeepney drivers told me it was closed since November 2022. For those who wanted to visit there please check first if the place is open.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Unique, not congested, you can take all pictures that you can as long as you have a big, memory on your phone and DLSR, showcasing the rich culture, very accessible either taking a PUV, Taxi's, our your own private car, you can buy snacks, drinks and souvenirs."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"This place is really something. The Stone Kingdom, with an area of 6,000 square meters surrounded by tall trees and created resembling rice terraces, was built by Pio Velasco. This opened June of last year 2021 and immediately became a huge hit."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Enjoyed much. Proud Igorota.Igorot Stone Kingdom is a representation of how our ancestors had protected the nature, how they work hard and as a team build"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It has no cultural significance to Baguio. It's a mere  stone age rock theme park. Don't waste your time. Go to the nearby Tam- awan Village.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's fun actually, maybe that place keeps you a memories with your families, friends,  someone and etc. Although it's not finish yet but yeah it's fun. Me as half igorot I introduce to you to visit are Igorot Stone Kingdom."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's looks fabulous the original stone carving is so beautiful, but now there were making concrete building on side which looks so dual and ruining the beauty of original one, as still work was going on may be after finishing the work it's will look nice"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Although some parts are still under construction, The family enjoyed the place. Nice place for taking photos. Igorot culture."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Ok for kids I guess. This is about as fake as it comes. All the statues are plastic and the whole thing seems contrived with a complete lack of igorot presence (apart from vendors hiring igorot dress for 50 pesos).  The fake ""castle"" may appeal to kids who can pretend they are kings and queens.The cafe at the top of the ""castle"" is ok and offers turon, cheese sticks, kikiam at 20 pesos a piece. Sadly there was no BBQ left"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Beautiful piece of work but other than that, it’s just some rocks and stones stacked up together, in some standards, this may fail due to some safety reasons like railings and other caution signs particularly to the little bridge across."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Enough space for the number of tourists with kind and helpful staff
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place and IG Worthy posts!Affordable entrance fee too!Prepare for short climbs though. 😇😂😅
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Place is best to visit if you visit other locations around the area like farmer's daughter and the village. However, the structures doesn't give the IP vibes due to roman and european archi structures. Place is still on ongoing improvement. You can get a picture of the St Bernard dog stationed there or you can dress up as a native. Make sure to grab either strawberry or ube flavored taho at the entrance."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Great view and we only climbed one half of the whole place. The place can get a bigger in the future because of ongoing construction.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It literally is made if stone. Its better if you visit the place during dry season. It has its own parking but its is too high to climb for common cars. Neighboring parking costs Php 100.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,See for yourself beautiful stone structures made by Baguio's Local Residents...Entrance fee at 100 pesos per person.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Just an amazing display of native art/architecture!  Pictures I'd seen prior to visiting cannot do justice to the enormity of this place!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Parking is very limited. Other parking costs PHP 100. Not very encouraging to bring own Car.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Perfect only for Commuters there are no Parking Lot for Tourist and the Police Outside are Vigorous to Apprehend all the Vehicles Outside the Stone Kingdom...😡😡😡😡
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Another bucket list you can add when you visit the summer capital of the Philippines - Baguio City. Something new to enjoy. Entrance fee is a bit costly which is 100 for adult and it tends to be a bit crowded during weekends. It would be best to visit this place during weekdays and in the morning. There's also a cafe on top of it which you will enjoy the full scenery of the place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The stone constructed amazinglyCozy surroundingsQuite a bit crowded during our visit because it was 12nn. If  you plan to make a visit I highly recommend to get there early to enjoy the area and for sure you will gonna get the best shoot for Instagram  😉
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Place is good for pictures, you can pay for an igorot atire for like 50php, and donate money to booths and real igorots for a picture"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice view but the parking fee is to much 100 pesos flat rate
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's one of the nicest attraction in Baguio. Must visit. Built in mostly white stones.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This new park is awesome and spacious. Another site that must be enjoyed while in Baguio furlough.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,What to expect? E di stones! 😁👍
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"For 100 pesos entrance fee, sulit naman since okay ung view even if construction still on going. Instagramable place din. Medjo crowded lang when we went there."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,On going construction. Expensive entrance fee.. good place for picture taking especially if you have the time and energy to go higher and capture the whole development. Igorot costume as well available in cheaper price.Nov. 2021
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Mainit, go here early so youll have parking space. Make sure you have energy coz its mostly climbing and more climbing. Better if you have your own water. Entrance is 100p for adults and 80 for kids, 3yo below is free"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Still a work in progress. Crowd control should be better.Picturesque area.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Another tourist attraction in Baguio. There is a ₱100 entrance fee for adult and ₱50 for children. You need to have energy when you visit this place because it's going up. The architectural is nice and you have to photograph the place in landscape to appreciate. There are some food stalls inside selling strawberry flavored taho and ice cream and fresh strawberry.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Amazing manmade tourist spot i’ve ever seen, can’t imagine how long did they build it"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Igorot Kingdom. The place was just new and under construction. Typical story of the Igorot's culture and means of living which is gold mining.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Great spot for photos. Still under construction but looking good. Will come back after a year or two.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very accommodating and amazing place to explore everyday nice place to view it
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Great for tourism, try it when you are here in baguio, enjoy the view and have fun."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I think this place is a total ripoff for its entrance price. Sure, it's affordable but comparing its rates from other spots this place is a total ripoff. It's not even finished. First reaction is it's like from the medieval period and not an Igorot kingdom. Nice to see just for curiosity and for the experience of coming here."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Love it but it is not finished yet I hope that it will be finished when we go there again.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New place to visit in Baguio. Still in the process of conatructing the upper part of the structure.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is so relaxing to visit. Inside the place has a milk tea shop located at the very top.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I really like the way they built the place. Great experience
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Too crowded,100 per pax. For pictorial its not worth it. Visit as early as you can"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This is an athletic challenge and worth a visit. I wish they can improve (as they are still constructing) and maintain it well. I hope it does not end up all faded and forgotten-looking as the coloured houses on the hill.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place and the structures.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A nice place to visit when you’re in Baguio. Sml but cultural.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Well we didn't get to see inside but I think it's once of the good place to do photographing specially at late afternoon to dusk.  Oh and maybe a little bit cheaper entrance fees
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I visited the place 3 times.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Overhyped. Nothing's special. Clearly they just built rubbles and called it a ""tourist spot."" A best seller for tasteless pinoy tourists. Cringy."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,So beautiful and it amaze me makes me think that how did they made this beautiful creation.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It’s a new tourist spot in Baguio.. still under construction.It tells a story about The IGOROTs.. beautiful place to visit.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Amazing structure hope will last but be careful coz i don't think there's any engineering calculation in here
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Do it on weekdays. Not worth it. Not for the old with achy knees. Traffic so heavy. Just went there awhile ago. Its Saturday.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not yet finished. The view were great
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is amazing as well as the story behind it. If you can, visit this place on a weekday to avoid the crowd. Don't go here hungry and weak because you'll be walking a lot. If you're lucky to be here on a nice and quite foggy weather, your trip to the top will definitely be worth it."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The entrance fee is bit expensive. The experience is okay but is not value for money. Parking is a bit small and can be tricky for car maneuvers, especially if the parking is almost full."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A unique place to have instragramable photo. Good to visit when not raining because there is no shed to stay if it's raining. Prepare also for entrance and parking fees.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Construction is not yet complete but nice view. Best to go on weekdays so fewer people.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This place is nothing but a heaped of stones put together like riprap and some as stone cladding on a big place. There are stores inside that do not add beauty to the place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A good place to take a picture and chill with friends/family It has 100Php entrance fee for every person, its fine but foods and souvenirs inside are expensive"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,* a new place to visit* great manual work* real stone work* good exposure to some highland culture and arts
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's not everyones idea of ""Stone Kingdom, a glorified copy if battlements very cleverly done, but you need to be fit and patient to go all around. In my opinion better suited as a playground for kids, there is nothing, in my opinion, warrants the title of "" Kingdom"""
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Beautiful places,i will be back soon"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This place is not 100% complete as of March 2022 but promises to be another good tourist destination in Baguio City. There is an entrance fee of 100 pesos per head. Parking may not be enough especially during peak season.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Terrible rip-off built on a delusion. You walk around and climb up stony stairs to see nothing, but bad views and ugly souvenirs. Worst of all, it is built on a delusion of a kingdom, doing history and culture a disservice. The Cordilleras were tribal lands, never unified under a ""kingdom."" Kids are bound to believe this moneymaking false news."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The experience is one of a kind but it still need minor improvements.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New place to see if interested. Over rated although lots of tourists visiting the place. Not recommended if you have a problem with your legs.  Not suitable for wheelchairs and pushchairs.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Nice place to visit and to have a bit of exercise in going up hehehehe, its about 90% on its finishing touches, but its open to the public already...."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Igorot Stone Kingdom is such a nice place, with good view and also good people around. I really enjoyed my little minute of time visiting this place cause it's really worth it. Traveling from Solano Nueva Vizcaya is really an exhausted Travel but really worth it when we arrived at Baguio.You can also visit Igorot Stone Kingdom in the Province Of Benguet...I tell you, your long travel would be worth it.😊You can also enjoy the view with your favorite street food and your favorite person😍Yiee.."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Was able to climb up to top of the kingdom. The view was very rewarding! Definitely coming back here.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,They display the art of stone showcase the artistry of Cordilleran stone walling. It also showcase the culture and practices of the place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's an amazing creation of their tribes craft making beautiful and astonishing building out of stone. This really captures my heart❤❤❤
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Still inder construction, but views are outtstanding, php 100 entrance fee during our visit aug 20, 2022 ... This is promising site in the future .... Cheap souvineers too"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,brand-new ancient buildings
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is nice. It's cold and foggy in the afternoon (most of the time) so I guess it would be better to go there in the morning.Ps. Friend on photo
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Amazing kingdom, lots of souvenirs,  clean toilets. Great Cafe n coffee shops. Very popular"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A must visit place. Not advisable for those who have knee problems. Very difficult in parking areas if you have cars, parking place is expensive range 100 above"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The site is privately-owned I think and then the developer thought of converting it into a tourist spot but didn't put enough planning so that it avoids over-crowing, parking spaces aren't enough and the traffic is high during weekends..."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I came here with my boyfriend! And nag enjoy kami sa view!!! Luckily we got there earlier before it went busy and packed with lots of visitors/tourists It was indeed worth the travel 👏🏼♥️
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place but go when its a weekday as the place tends to be full of tourists on holidays and weekends. The place is instagram worthy.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The stone structure are a sight to see but it seems a little dangerous due to the fact that it isn't secured by atleast cement or wires, but the viewing experience overall is nice"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A lot of work to get the rocks, stones in the right place, very prestigious project with a great result, enjoyable for the whole family, because of its popularity very crowded"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Still on going development so all thing are new. The view is clean. Some accessories are still to be put up. Over all since this time. The place really is like a kingdom on it's outside appearance. There is no indoor yet.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A decent theme park in Baguio. There is still work going on but this does not stop tourists from flocking to this attraction.The place can be chaotic as tourists were not mindful of the flow. Some people take off their face masks for photos but a number of them go around the park and do not wear their face masks anymore.Good for one-time visit.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice setup but some of the parts are still being constructed.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Its an amazing experience to visit the place Stone Kingdom in Baguio city...😊
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Still under renovation when we visited it.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Amazing . Another place to visit in baguio citu
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"None much of an offer save for a man made structure for picture taking and IG addicts to be honest. Very clever business idea what with 100 per head entrance fee and the multitude of crowd. Overheard an expat exclaimed, ""this is a tourist trap""."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very nice and goodWonderful
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New attraction in Baguio. Beautiful structures and overlooking of the place.

Igorot Stone Kingdom,Good for taking pictures. Family and couples.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Took some great photos here. Try to go mid week when crowds are less.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not Yet Finished but the place is a good place to know some igorot infos and stuffs. Might want to get a guide for a fee for the quick infos.. but can be done solo anyways. Make sure to have a good shoes that doesnt slip in case of rainfall..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Parking:If you're early, there's a few slots here. Nearby Sozimura, Long Road Cafe offers pay parking and pay CR as well. Further uphill, Petron also offers parking space. We were there around 8am and it can get really crowdy.Registration:Queue for registration is fast but they still use paper ticket that needs to be stamped right in front of the entrace. P100 for adult, P80 for seniors.Attraction:There are signs inside, you can go around and find a perfect photo spot as you wish. There's also food stalls and Igorot costume rental. I heard it can be foggy in the afternoon but better come on a weekday. There's also a sunset view point so I'm assuming it gets really crowded around that time.CR:Haven't tried, pay CR available in nearby cafesNearby:Restos but parking is hardThe Farmer's Daughter (with parking but opens 9:30am)Tam-awan Village (didn't see the parking, opens 8am)"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A surprising magical place. Awed by the intricate building of stone walls, towers and stairs. Trully mesmerizing. Get yourself a cup of coffee and spend the whole afternoon in cloud 9."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Great place for tourist, very enjoyable like hiking in a kingdom"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I'd rate it 5 stars if they improve the parking space.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"One of the best place to visit.Fastantic and enjoyable to visit in Long Road st.Baguio Best architecture of different stone repraft designs and made by the natives.Igorot Bridge,Mines Cave, and Castle ready for selfies to be enjoyed by family and friends."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Instagram-able place and great for family bonding. Crowded place as it was one of the newest tourist attraction in the city of Pines.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Place is nice and Instagramable .. do good clicks only the prob is parking
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Good for pictures. Just it. No activity.. You can eat snacks and ice cream in their snack area.. Good exercise to walk up and down..entrance fee at 100 pesos.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,My 1st time to go here and it was amazing hope to visit again with my fam🤗As usual parking space still hard to find out🤣
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The experience is surreal ❤️
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"One of a kind experience., u will prove it to yourself  that patience is virtue once u visited the Igorot Stone Kingdom how they constructed the igorot stone kingdom manually."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Best to go on a weekday. Its too crowded now to enjoy.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,if you're willing to ubos your energy.Go here.*historical*informational*entertaining
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Truly a place for the Igorot experience. The up and down climbs through small walk paths mimic the up and down climbs across the mountains. I kid you not. But its an enjoyable experience at certain levels and stops you get introduced to aspects of igorot culture: the white carabao, the prayer cone structures of the igorot gods, the stone throne of the igorot king,  the meeting chamber of the igorot elders where they decide to make war, and the igorot bridge of gold; are just some of the sights. Enjoy keep an open mind. By crossing the bridge of gold the igorot traverses into a western style castle. This is akin to the igorot migrants journey, who upon achieving success, he migrates to the great western lands and traverses their kingdoms and makes them his own. Look and see this underlying story in the great Igorot Stone Kingdom."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Such beautiful structures. Spent an hour or two mesmerized by everything. Very picturesque!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This one's a new place to visit in Baguio. Every corner is great to take some selfie pics!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Awesome... Thanks and keep improving
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"So expensive for the entrance, not reasonable for visit, there are thousands of tourist and yet they have only 2 toilets open, people need to fall in line"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,100 entrance fee
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Still in progress , much better if they consider more safety precautions"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This Stone Kingdom is one of a kind!!!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I loved the experience. One takes a journey through the 'Kingdom'. In the end, you experience immense joy and peace. It's beautiful and spiritual. Although it's still under construction, it's a great place to visit, alone or in group."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A must in your itinerary . old and young ones will enjoy the scenic view of this stone Kingdom. Make sure you wear comfy shoes as you will climb a lot of steps to get to the top.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Super love by the kids. 👍
Igorot Stone Kingdom,There's no parking space. You can park on the next establisment but its too expensive.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New tourist attraction place to add in your bucket list. A must see in Baguio City.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Its not finished yet but they already charge adult 100 pesos per head and discounted price for kids. Not much to do here aside from taking pictures and walk up the castle which is not yet a castle but a building of concrete. The white stones look nice on picture but they still lack baguio greenery there. it gets hot there when the sun is up its probably because of all the stones
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Another majestic new tourist attraction in Baguio City to visit.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Beatiful and good place, it reminds the Anse stories of the past."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,So much fun i love igorot stone kingdom super enjoy that place i love it very much i promise to come back 😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Such a great master piece from our igorot brothers and sisters. It is a must to visit.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I think the entrance fee is overpriced. Compared to Botanical Garden and Mines View where entrance is only PHP10, you can enjoy more beautiful scenes than at this place which entrance fee is PHP100 per person."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Well.... only taking pictures on high altitude. Nothing muchExpensive entrance fee 100 for adults 80 for seniors and kids. 3 and below are free, ridiculous 👎"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Igorots really have the knack in making stone walls
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Under expansion prin,i enjoy the flute music from local igorot musician"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,relaxing view from above. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A display of the well-known stone masonry skills of the igorots. Fascinating but not planned well for tourists to rsally appreciate their works. Sayang naman ang angking talento ng mga igorot. And parking is a b*&%$!!!!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Amazing and nice experience for kids...need to prep your feet and legs for a lot of walking
Igorot Stone Kingdom,One of the newest attractions in Baguio.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"They are still improving their place, but it is already instagram worthy! Visit now!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice and Historic Place
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Love it....Every moment counts ..It's a different kind of experience.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,100peso entrance feeGood for photos and that's itMaybe the owner is Lego lover ☺️
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is still improving.Even though its still under construction, its already a nice place to walk around and take photos..."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A new place to explore. Continuous development is observed. Maybe a museum of cordillera cultures will be here soon.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The fee to enter and move around doesnt seems to be worth it. Much better to visit the Mines View Park instead.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The architecture of the kingdom was spectacular! I've never seen such thing before. It was absolutely worth the trip for I took so many good photos at Igorot Stone Kingdom.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The amount of people coming in should be maintained. Went there earlier and it was really crowded to a point where you needed to squeeze to get through crowds of people considering that we are still in a pandemic. The signs for which way to go was not visible which caused confusion among many people especially on the path to the right going up. We weren't even able to go to the very top. The price of a ticket (₱100) is way too expensive for you to just walk up some stone structure with no proper signages present. It isn't really worth it.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Instagrammable place, great for those who love to trek and appreciate the stunning view of this man-made marvel. Native-Igorot costumes can be rented at 50PHP only, where you can take a picture anywhere within. Drinks/food stalls available at the side right when you enter, same as when you reach the top of the castle-front."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place seems to be a bit too artificial. The place is also too crowded. The place seems to be still under construction. Both commuting to get there and parking is a challenge.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place in view
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"looking at the kingdom from the deck view was amazing! its instagrammable! tiktokers, fb lovers, am sure you will like the place 100%!don't forget prenup events, too.  however, i can say it was a nice experience going up the top but, the entrance fee is quite expensive for 100php when all you could really do is to look at the view. and do a lot of photoshoot 😊"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Other parts were not yet finished when we visited. Far from where we stay.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,nice place to unwind and relax
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Place is great and has a lot ot potential. Must visit.Be wary of senior citizen and kids as this involves a lot of climbing to go into good spot
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Be aware of business during the weekends. Go for weekdays for the nicest pictures.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very crowded on weekends.a heritage place must be visited.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Appreciate the effort to have another tourist spot. But there is just no ""soul"" to it."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This is a popular tourist spot. It's really just a site where you have multiple pathways and a single bridleway for tourists to go through like a maze of sorts with the backdrops resembling a castle on one side and the other side being made of stone. There's food served at the top. Parking is limited
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The entrance is too high for what u can see are just pure stones.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New place and new experienced
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not recommended to visit..This is only a man made place I don't see any historical value or relavance to the place where it was build.And also don't go late to the place coz it's so hard to get taxi and no jeepney around the area.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It has to be finished to be able to appreciate it.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Beautiful and nice
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Supper worth it! I love the place ❤️❤️❤️
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Entrance fee for adults is 100. The place is very nice. Amazinh landscape and view. Cafe is also available.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The entrance fee is expensive compared to other tourist spots
Igorot Stone Kingdom,There was still some construction ongoing while people were visiting.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's ok if you want to get a feel of how a fortess is like. Be ready to walk and climb up stairs.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Good to see how they made this place so beautiful. Thankful to the locals, nice job👍"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not an elderly friendly place as the stairs are too steep. But the view is nice.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Great place to take pictures and to stroll around. Just hope more ethnic activities will be added. My family did enjoy joining the dance.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Kudos to those who constructed it. I hope it continues to be safe and awesome for visitors

Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's okay to walk around but it's semi finish and you feel you walk on a construction side. So for the 100 pesos entrance they should have waited to open.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A very unique experience and a very amazing place. Lots of history within the story of the building of this stone kingdom. Encourage all who visit Baguio to visit this unique place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place Is not yet done, still a great place to visit."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I think this place is so unique in terms of viewing a place since it's the fist time everyone can find this amazing kingdom made by our country men proud to be called the igorot stone kingdom.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It was a weekend and it was raining, but other than that it was okay."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is not complete finish constructing. It's still open for visit
Igorot Stone Kingdom,There's not much to see except the stoneworks are done by igorots and you can help them by visiting this place
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Still under renovation but It looks Good
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A lot of trucks and construction happening around the site. Not worth paying the money until it is complete.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Tourist spot in baguio

Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's a new attraction and still awaiting for the completion for us to see the beauty ❤️❤️❤️!

Igorot Stone Kingdom,Waste of time. Although the place is still ongoing construction and unless you're after the actual experience of seeing the piled up stones and less on nature immersion go somewhere else.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Although this place is still under construction, or is not yet finish, overall it is beautiful."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The whole place is great! It is just amazing how they build the stone kingdom. Another place to see when you visit Baguio City.

Igorot Stone Kingdom,An impressive tourist attraction.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This place is still under construction but is now a sought-after place to take pictures in…it has plenty of people visiting .. the cafe is not done yetBut they do have small “stores” where you can buy food to get by…This stone kingdom shows how the highlanders usually do stone masonry…
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's impressive to see, however an Igorot friend informed me that this is purely a tourist attraction and has very little to do with Igorots"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not ready entering very expensive
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Amazing creation
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I sooo love the place..❤❤❤...but they need to add a cafe or a better snack shack with lots of table and chairs to sit because surely after a stroll in this magneficient park many of the tourists visiting would love a good food to nibble while resting at the same time appreciating the beauty of nature.....
Igorot Stone Kingdom,One of the new places to visit
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The price of entrance is not worth ... it must have something souveneir aside from sightseeing ... or maybe lower the entrance fee ...

Igorot Stone Kingdom,This is a new attraction here in baguio. Well this was a stack stone castle. well i came here in the middle of a pandemic That's why i enjoy the view more.. the place is picturesque.👌🏻
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Sorry but I just wanted to give an honest review — I find this place quite overrated. Medyo mahal yung entrance fee, and I find the attraction as quite boring. Better to walk around na lang and get the most out of you Baguio escapade.If you’re already there, try the CARIOCA near the entrance, omg not too sweet at masarap talaga."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Was closed.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very nice
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The entrance fee is 100 pesos80 for seniorsIt's good that he's still doing it on the go. There is also a cr at the top near the canteen at the top on the right side. Parking is really the only problem sometimes and the traffic. There are also those who sell snacks inside such as jam, strawberries, and snacks that are available below if you can climb to the canteen above."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"・If you come to Baguio, you should visit this place for the time being・It is also easily accessible from SM Baguio, and I think it was about 130 pesos in about 10 minutes by taxi.・It is crowded with tourists, but the wait is not frustrating.・For the time being, the Igorotto costume is a paid rental, but you can wear it and move around the premises, so you can get excited (price I don't remember)・Going up a narrow road, the view from above is really good!・However, there are no special souvenirs at this spot just for taking pictures.・There are no impressive activities,・The aunt is wearing a costume and taking a commemorative photo, but there is no particular meaning. ordinary auntie."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A very nice new attraction in Baguio. The design is amazing. The place we are going is foggy and the cold feels good 😍. There are also food stalls such as arrozcaldo, corn, finger foods. The strawberry taho is delicious.Worth a visit here..It was in July that we visited there. The weather is nice so the sightseeing is super enjoyable."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not a Recommended Tourist Spot.100 entrance fee is not Worth ... Too High ..Overcrowded during weekends. There is no limit to entry .. how can a lot of people be picture friendly .. it's still not in order .. 100 is too much ..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A must place to visit if you go to Baguio. The place is crowded even weekdays. It's hard when it's raining and there's not much shelter but it's a nice place to explore. You will be exhausted from climbing chin.100 per adult80 for kids
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"We went there on Sunday. There are so many people, there is no more social distancing, the other steps can slip if you are not careful. It's nice to visit on weekdays and there are few people, but for me it's not worth the 100 entrance fee on weekends."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,great archi designs although the stone kingdom is over. Maybe we will come back when the place is finished to see more of the beauty. We couldn't even climb to the other side because our feet hurt and we were tired from 2 days of walking around Baguio..haha
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"If you want to visit Igorot Stone Kingdom, have breakfast, so that there aren't too many people and you can also go solo hehehe. Beautiful up to the heights. Parking is a bit difficult when there are a lot of tourists. But beautiful here, as in! Very good experience. No mixed char!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's okay to have a few people for a Wednesday afternoon. It's hard to take a picture without someone else being a photobomber. Nice to see but not to go back.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Nice place🤗 100 per person entrance fee, beautiful place, it's high to climb, not possible with rheumatism 😁 just google map to get to the location more easily. Parking is expensive, we went to 100 😞 just look for cheaper ones"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Great place. Clean and very relaxing. The entrance fee is P100 pesos for adults. It's worth it since it's long while walking and climbing. The store outside are expensive, it's better to buy upstairs because the store is cheaper."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Worth it. The construction of the buildings is very beautiful and quality. Go for a walk friends!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"As of May 2022, he still has construction going on. Not worth the 100 pesos entrance fee 😅"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is beautiful but the 100per head entrance is too expensive and the upstairs parking space for motorbikes is dangerous, it is prone to simple, although someone is guarding the helmets .."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's not done yet, but the place is very beautiful, the e-fee is worth it, make sure to bring water so you don't get wet while walking."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice view relaxing so nice location superb nice view at the very top😍💕💕💕💕 will be visiting again
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The igorot stone kingdom is super beautiful, you will be really impressed by their work❤️"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Too bad it's raining but it's so beautiful it's worth it!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"As for me, it's pricey because there aren't many activities, just good for taking pictures, appreciating and you'll almost just walk around."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Unique place and easy to get to, beautiful picture picture..Note with intance pay. except 3 years old below"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,He's not done yet. So some new ones will be added. There is an entrance of 100php
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"For P100 entrance, you can see and take pictures of many rocks! 😂 Kidding aside, the place itself looks great! Although, they are still doing a lot and improving in the area itself. Make the parking lot difficult. Very limited parking space outside."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A very boring place, low-cost construction, no artistic sense at all, not a cultural monument, and even a good perspective for taking pictures. The charges are unreasonable, the 200p admission ticket and the parking fee are also expensive. Disorganized management, only suitable for location shooting, not suitable for internal tours"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's a bit boring for me, the place is small, but these stone walls are special, and it's over after taking a few photos"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"akyatan to, mahangin pagdating sa taas..nice and refreshing .."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"We are so amazed to this place, tho we didn't go up to the very high part of the place and we are still adding a lot of improvements to the place :) Hopefully there will be mini activities for those who took the tour."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,There are a lot of people and it's still raining but the place is okay love the castle ❣️  
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's worth going even if it's storming😂😂
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's ok inside, so maybe 100 entrance fee because it's still under construction. It's also hot inside, more climb if you bet a good insta worthy pic"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is beautiful, there are many rocks, it's good to take pictures"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,You are worthless. If you're into photos and not experienced you might love the place. Very risky parking especially for motorcycles. A lot of falling and falling. Not worth the trip.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice 😍😍😍 you can stay overnight hihi.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"There is a plaque at the entrance to this under construction attraction.It's the story of how a guy, following a dream of a white carabao, decided to rebuild the Igorot kingdom, which disappeared many years ago.A bold idea, and construction is underway, with thousands of stones lined up.Maybe better to come back when the construction is finished."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"100per head senior 50php, 80 kids. It's ok for them to develop the place"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The road is slippery especially when wet. Not for those who are malululain kasi matarik tignan. Clean nmn the place but a bit pricey at the entrance of 100 then only less designs and the place has no other special features. They have statues and carvings plus the free use of thier traditional dress and pwede mag pa kuha with Igorot Locals. It's not almost complete yet because you can still see many under construction in this part of the place. On the next visit, I wonder if the fee will be more worthwhile."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is beautiful. But those who charge above the riprap area are unappealing. Paintings are only close together but 20/head. Then when we took a picture at the May Igorot standee, someone immediately shouted twenty per head, even more hostile. We took a picture again in the chair, another twenty, there was another twenty in the chair next to him, literally just 3 steps, another twenty can head. The two young women charged angrily. Unbecoming of a tourist spot. I hope the charge is only once upon entering. Every twitch, charge ... Umbra that leaves happy and went for a walk, leaves When he lost his appetite for the place -_-"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,You can also rent Baguio's folk costumes. Some of them were playing Andean folk music.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Good for picture taking. There are also parents of Igorot Outfit that you can wear in the whole place to take pictures. The size of the place and still under development when we went, but the potential is great if it takes time, given that it is 2020 to start working on it. Near Tam-Awan Village so it's good to go along with your walk."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's closed..until further notice.. We went on 11/21/22. They should have information on their page so don't waste your time going there..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Mdanda puru stone ,, under contruction pa pero ok namn"

Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's OK. You can see the art of the area but it seems unfinished. It's not friendly because there are a lot of climbers. 😂

Igorot Stone Kingdom,Love it. The beauty and the cleanliness of the place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"the best, nice work"

Igorot Stone Kingdom,"If you are going there with transpo be prepared for the traffic and very difficult parking space... I suggest you go around 7am and wait for it to open, because you won't be able to enjoy it at noon because the traffic is already difficult, parking is even more difficult, and prepare 100php per head..."
