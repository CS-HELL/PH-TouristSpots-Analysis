Burnham Park,"An excellent place for family and friends to visit. It has no entrance fees, and has a lake where you can ride a boat (P 150) and park grounds where you can ride small bikes (P 100). Not a place I would recommend at night as it gets quite dark here at some spots. But the morning is a superb experience you will definitely want to come back to."
Burnham Park,"A lovely place to be on a nice day.We were pleasantly surprised and very pleased at how long a period of time that we had aboard our boat on the lake.You may hire bicycles(some carrying as many as three people)on the cycle track for a modest fee,and once again the period of time allowed is most generous indeed ~ so it is good value for money.Spend time here is amazing. I love the place."
Burnham Park,"Definitely one of the best places to visit in Baguio. üíñ Burnham Park is a crowded tourist destination, but for good reason. The assortment of flowers that you will see in the park is truly breathtaking.Aside from sightseeing, you can also do boating, have your picture taken by a photographers' cooperative in tribal clothes, rent cars or bikes, and play at the amusement park."
Burnham Park,I have always been looking at this park ever since 2018. I only had the chance to review the park because I flexed the view of this park to my Japanese friend so that he can go here someday. Still crowded as ever. There's a lot of tourist as always. It is still fun to see everyone having fun here.
Burnham Park,Very beautiful park with boating and cycling available inside the park. Good place to relax and have clean air. Whenever I visit Philippines I make sure to visit Burnham park each time.
Burnham Park,A lot cleaner and crowd is more manageable more than ever. Police presence is constant so you feel more safe. More public CR are around and increased number of evenly spread out trash bins. Just make sure you do your part and clean as you go.
Burnham Park,Bring something to protect you from the heat of the sun when going up in this place. family vehicles are not  allowed to go up to this point because the area where you will see a good view of the tower and the west Philippines sea is not wide enough  for vehicles. tricycle fare per trip is 50 pesos as of 2022 with a maximum of 3persons per trip.
Burnham Park,"I/we enjoyed Burnham Park. We visited when it was busy and mellow, day and night. Felt safe. Numerous low level things to do for all ages. Fun to see nostalgic things to do (bumper cars, bike/pedal rentals) all sorts of food vendors, even massage people (but not sure where that happens).We had a picnic and someone offered (and we bought) blue tarp to sit on.Recommend and would return but wouldn‚Äôt call it a must see.Parking is hard to come by so walk or get dropped off is key."
Burnham Park,"Burnham Park is considered to be one of the most famous parks in the country. It is located on Jose Abad Santos Drive, Baguio City 2600 Benguet Philippines. A park is a popular place for both locals and tourists. This place is often full-packed with people regardless if it is rainy or not. The most well-known activity in the park is ‚Äúbiking‚Äù. There are lots of bicycles for rent at a very decent price. It is an excellent activity for youngsters and adults."
Burnham Park,"The place was also nice to see in the morning especially trying activities a family can enjoy like biking, riding a boat and having picnics. There are food area and lots of rest rooms. Parking is just hard during peak season. (Forgot to take pics since we just visit first in the evening for the night market üòä). The night market is beside the park."
Burnham Park,The best place to have a relaxing time after a long day or week. Most especially on a really nice weather. Have a sit in one of the benches around the park while sipping your freshly brewed coffee or any fave beverage. This is a not to miss place. Free and worth it!
Burnham Park,"Very busy during daytime, glad that we are almost back to normal now. Bikes, Tricycle, boat, etc. for rent are very affordable/cheap. Just the right price. Clean area minus the color of the lake's water."
Burnham Park,"A great place for a trip with your family, friends and your partner!-There are available paddle boat operators that you can rent from 200-350 pesos.-Bikes can be rented from 75 pesos up to 150 pesos that is already good for 30 minutes.Location is strategic. There are several walking distance establishments where you can eat and jeepney vehicles are just nearby."
Burnham Park,I love walking around baguio especially at Burnham Park because you can see a lot of flowers around the park. You can also do many recreational activities like biking and riding a boat. They also have food stalls once you got hungry! This park is also near markets.
Burnham Park,"one of our favorite places in Baguio. Unfortunately, only those checked-in or with membership are allowed to visit. they have golf and other sports activities, great food, activities for children, clean and spacious rooms, and very near to camp john hay."
Burnham Park,Burnham Park is a good place to stroll both night and day. There are paid parking lots around the area you have to pick the area where you will be staying for a long time to prevent longer walks.We took the boating at night and it is more beautiful and silent than in the morning. We paid ‚Ç±150 for the boat plus additional ‚Ç±50 because we were tired to row the boat.We wanted to try roller skates but it was already closed at 7PM. The bump car was the other ride we were able to try it was ‚Ç±100/5 mins/head and with a weight limit.
Burnham Park,Big park with plenty of space to do a variety of activities offered by the park or on your own. Many restrooms situated around the park as well as food stops. Not many restrooms open when it gets dark. Not sure I've seen many trash bins but the park seemed to be well maintained from garbage
Burnham Park,The park offers a lot of activities and is well known for the boat ride. You may choose what you want to do there and enjoy the weather while doing your activities.
Burnham Park,"Things to do around Burnham Park are:- Have a boat ride in the lake- Rent a bike to ride around- Walk around the park- Eat local food- Learn a little about history of the place.NOTE: There are locals who would suddenly stand near you and sing a song and ask for donation. It is up to you if you would give them. There are also locals who will offer you a massage for Php100.00.At weekends, it can be crowded. If you want a much quiet time, go on weekdays.There is a night market that pops up beside the park. It's a whole street of people selling products such as souvenirs, shirts, jackets, and a separate area for food."
Burnham Park,"Always iconic üåª Haven't been here for so long despite my distance, but it's due to some busy schedules and some usual distractions. Indeed, if you wanna ponder over things and genuinely cry while walking down the park like I did this early morning. Early as 4, 5 or 6AM is perfect if u wish for a wider space & less people. Meeting joggers too on the way pictures a healthy environment while the cold breezy wind dances.Tired now, benches are free, yet cold ha-ha!Burnham Park is üíû"
Burnham Park,It's a nostalgic visit for me. There you still have the man made lagoon where tourist can go on boating. There's these biking & cart area where kids & children alike can while away time waiting for their elders. Not far off is the market where fresh produce can be bought & taken as pasalubong.
Burnham Park,"Great park for a walk. In the middle you can rent a boat for a boat riding around P200 for 30 mins. On the upper part there was an amusement park with skating rink and or you can rent a bike, price depends on what bike youll rent. Overall its an enjoyable place with the family."
Burnham Park,"Had we arrived during day time, we would have relished the beauty of Burnham Park to the brim. We visited there late in the evening, but we still captured the spirit of fun and calmness that this park had offered to us. Thank you people of Baguio City. Your Burnham Park is superb!"
Burnham Park,"Gone are the glory days of this park but still the local government find ways to improve the park to be more attractive to local tourist you can paddle boat ,bike ,take a picture and taste of strawberry Taho  and Also nkt forget the cold weather"
Burnham Park,"This place is iconic and sits at the heart of the city. No Baguio trip is complete without this stop as a staple.Upside: there are lots of activities you can do in this park, including boating, biking, and skating. Early in the morning, there are also different workout groups you can join (Zumba, Tai Chi, etc) At night, Harrison Street is closed for the pop-up night market. There are nice policemen helping out with directions and making sure there are no peddlers. You can have a picnic here. Every street that surrounds the park has enough going--food places, souvenir shops, ukay stores, gas station. Name it. Easy to get taxis too.Downside: when in Baguio always keep your purse in front of you. Their streets are known for petty thefts. This last trip during the pandemic we felt safer and more relaxed. Restrooms are old, they aren't that clean. You have to pay up and some cubicles are squat toilets. Just do your numbers back where you're staying.Do we recommend this place? Yes.Are we going back? Yes."
Burnham Park,"Since we came there late at night, obviously I can no longer make a detailed review of the place. Anyways, from where we sat down, I still can see the beauty of the lake. There are still a lot of people going to and from my bench. Expectedly, the place is cold. Too bad I don't have anyone with me to cuddle. Hahahaha. Will be visiting the place again soonest I will be back in Baguio."
Burnham Park,"A place for the family and groups of people. It has everything from entertainment to relaxation, from skating rinks to bikeways to fun rides and food. Parking is quite difficult to come by, so you have to be patient to get one."
Burnham Park,"Its not complete for a tourist/visitor not to see this restored park b4 he leaves the city. Walk to see and take selfie with the (dont pick) flowers, grounds, boats, trees and fountains around. The lake has few fishes and different boats designed for you to have fun rowing or just ride. Also Join free zumba or just run and walk around best every (early) dewy mornings (sometimes to catch up fogs) . Located at the center of the city and its accessible to all transportation areas some with mini buses that offers free sakay going to the mall, market, cathedral.... Accessible to food houses, recreational centers, grocery, coffffeeee shops, churches, night market, pasalubong stores, close to meetings, banks, schools and other universities, other govt entities and tge like. Youll find almost everything nearby malay mu pati jowa ma-nearby Burnham Park. So i suggest u walk. Rampa your beauty and the pogi looksüòÅ and its good for your health walking. Enjoy. See more and have fun staying in Baguio City."
Burnham Park,"Wallow in the cold breeze and peace here in Burnham Park Reservation.Just before leaving Baguio, my friends and I settled to hit this park for photo ops of course.We rambled the area despite the fact that in a few hours we'd leave for Manila.Noticing the kayaks afloat the lagoon, we agreed to ride one. Each has an oarsman (unlike our experience in Villa Escudero that we ought to learn how to row a canoe because no staff will go with you) yet some of us take turns in rowing our vessel. And we enjoyed it!I have forgotten if the ride is 30 minutes or more. What I vividly recall is our conversation the whole time. We amused ourselves talking about the presentiables and teasing our oarsman of it though he never really revealed who was he in favor of. The lad who rode with us is a college students according to him. In my guess, they are working to support their education. I don't know but the staff are of the same ages so I thought that they work there in order to study. They wore blue t-shirt for their uniform. Hey, you can look for them should you decide to ride a kayak and you could help send them to school.It's not a only a park where you can ruminate about life in general but it's also a park where activities can be done. Come and have a peek of it."
Burnham Park,Burnham park was clean and an amazing place to be with. It has a lot of story that you'll going to realize upon visiting.Ps. Few photos due not really a fond of phone upon visiting and busy enjoying the moment.
Burnham Park,"It was a nice experience, A man-made lake known as Burnham Lagoon, there are wooded areas, and lots of flowerbeds, there are swan boats that you can ride, aside from it, you can also jog and bike here."
Burnham Park,This is the most beautiful and colorful Burnham Park has been in a long while. It was not too crowded when I took a stroll yesterday morning.
Burnham Park,A lot of activities can be done here. The ambiance is nice. Plenty of food stands are available. Enjoyed my visit
Burnham Park,The place is improved and there are many more things to do in this wonderful place... You may have a perfect bonding place with your family and loved ones üòä
Burnham Park,"Went here mid March, on the week of Panagbenga Festival. The park was decently maintained, not a lot of litter as expected, and there were park guards at the Grandstand, especially during the event.We also went in the evening to try out their boat rides (we paid around PHP200 for 30mins, and you can rent out a boater as well if you can't row your own boat for Php50 additional fee). Definitely a decent place with benches if you want to relax and have a picnic for free. They also have bikes for rent if you want to roam around the park.Accessibility to the park maybe a little bit hard as they have designated gates for vehicle entry. If you're travelling via taxi, the drivers can only drop you off at certain gates."
Burnham Park,"Lots of things to enjoy in Burnham Park!First, you can go boating and you‚Äôll have plenty of choices. You can ride the basic boats (manual rowing) for 30min at 150-200php or add 50php if you‚Äôre not fit for rowing and someone will do it for you. üòÜ There are also boats that move by pedaling at 250php for 30min.Cycling is also fun. You can choose a bicycle, tricyle or a 4-wheel kart which cost 50-75php for 30 min. Just beware of the reckless drivers (mostly kids)!You can also have photoshoots from traditional photographers with the Igorot attire in this park. They take decent pictures and even guide you to pose for better experience. They charge 75php per 5R picture and will also send you soft copies via facebook.Fooodies! Even with the cold weather, you can never resist the strawberry and avocado ice cream. It‚Äôs at least 35php per cone (cheaper than what we bought in La Trinidad). There are also strawberry and ube taho, cotton candies, green mangoes, pomelo, guava and more which you can munch while walking or sitting.Lastly, you can just walk around and enjoy the view and weather in this park. There are lots of benches around the park to eat and rest. I even saw some families bringing food and having a dry picnic there."
Burnham Park,"Located at the center of Baguio, this park is for me the most visited place. Activities are biking, picnic, relaxing, kayaking and many more"
Burnham Park,"This park is Huge. You can do alot of stuff there with your family and friends.  Picnic, biking, boating, or just walk in the park. It's a nice place to spend you weekend chill."
Burnham Park,"spending tym with my self üòÇü§£ .thank you to my partner (3 in one monopad) you saved my  DAY ü§£üòÇüòÖ.the pLace are very relaxing even tho there's a lot of people visiting here, but not to crowded,  and sad to say I only have few hours to spend time hereSUNDAY05-08-22"
Burnham Park,Had a great experience visiting this place riding a boat was so great. There is also a biking place they are all in affordable prices and people are very friendly and accommodating.. Visit Baguio now and enjoy üôÇ
Mines View Observation Deck,"I went on a weekend and it was overcrowded!!! Barely any space to move! Overcrowded just to see the views. You can buy souvenirs and food there. I got the üåΩ and it was yummy. The bathroom was clean though when I went. The ticket fee isn't pricey at all, but no parking unless you go early."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great place to visit. Don't forget it to your itinerary. However, sometimes it's too crowded that it's hard to get decent photos of yours because there are a lot of people especially during weekends. Luckily I was able to get these photos. Love the scenery."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Come to Mines View Observation Deck to breathe and relax away from work!My friends and I went here very early to watch the sunrise. I managed to get few snaps of the place as it was jam packed with tourists from other parts of the Philippines. On a hindsight, it is always like this whenever I come to Baguio. This place never run out of tourists. And one do understand why... Had I happen to live near here, I'd also frequent this site.We no longer took pictures with the horses nor with igorot costumes on and whatever there are. We just wandered the Mines View Park to appreciate what's in there and buy food and clothing to bring home as souvenir to our love ones.We had our breakfast just outside the Park where a canteen offers inexpensive but satisfying food nonetheless while waiting for the Good Shepherd Convent to open because we'd buy their products like the famous ube jam.In the years to come and given the chance to come again to Baguio, I would still come to Mines View Park and do what I did.Visit the Park if you can! It's worth your time and energy."
Mines View Observation Deck,As usual. You‚Äôve got a nice view here if the weather permits you because sometimes the fog eats the view. Never the less it‚Äôs so relaxing and there are stalls where you can buy your pasalubongs as well. You just have to pay a small amount for you to enter the place but it‚Äôs worth it.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Gives a nice view of the mountains. Can get too crowded though, since tourists are not limited even in this time of the pandemic. Nice place to buy plants or get a quick bite too."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Observation Deck is indeed a breathtaking view. Despite the sun shining bright, it was only warm and not very hot.‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüëèThe parking area here is limited but the locals guide you to places where one can park. We parked right infront of a gated place to which they reassured us that it will be fine. It was not a paid parking but we provided tip.üòäThere are also a lot of places to buy pasalubong around here. You may check out as you walk to outside.üëèüëè............."
Mines View Observation Deck,There are many other good places you can visit on the ways most stunning views will see on road side if you are going by your own vehicle. This just a small place where from you can see one mountain that's all I didn't find anything interesting there. If you are going to botenical garden then Mines View is 3km from there
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great view of the mountain range. Unfortunately some are covered by houses, unlike before when Baguio was not that crowded. Lots of souvenirs to buy. They even sell a variety of plants in the area."
Mines View Observation Deck,Who would want to miss the Mines View Deck in Baguio City? I think most tourists visiting Baguio would not miss out this spot on their itinerary. You also get to taste the local delicacies & Filipino street foods here.
Mines View Observation Deck,The view was stunning. People liked lining up for picture taking dressed like the one on my image and they are enjoying how beautiful the nature is. The warm sun didn‚Äôt bother us because we feel the warmth as a relief from the city life we had.Baguio has a place in our heart and we will be back again.
Mines View Observation Deck,Great view and less crowded during pandemic.I recommend visiting during afternoon for picturesque sunset or morning for a more relaxing view of the mountains.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Overlooking view with a cold weather. If you want to buy souvenirs, t-shirts and pasalubog, this is the best place to go to as well as to have photos with colorful horses. Make sure to include it on your itinerary."
Mines View Observation Deck,The view on a clear sunny day was absolutely stunning. It's so crazy how the mountains of Benguet look like that for miles and miles. The deck itself wasn't big but just enough for everyone to see the view and have their photos. The visitors area where the shops were offered many pasalubong options
Mines View Observation Deck,"It is a great place to visit with family amazing  view with fog and lots of shops to buy goodies for pasalubong. But sometimes you have to move a bit far away from the entrance if you wanna buy some stuff, as the shops located in front of the entrance are a bit pricey compared to the  right or left side shops."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Observation Deck is indeed a breathtaking view. Despite the sun shining bright, it was only warm and not very hot.The parking area here is limited but the locals guide you to places where one can park.

You may check out as you walk to outside."
Mines View Observation Deck,"It's not like it used to be said by my sister. But the scenery is still breathtaking. Baguio really did get great guns.It's my first time here in Baguio. And I'm gonna make the best out of it.P.S a little thrifty advice from me to you. Try not to buy everything (i mean pasalubong) in just one place. If you're planning to visit places in Baguio, try buying memorabilia or pasalubong from each place you're gonna visit. For you to have various options and memorabilia from places to places."
Mines View Observation Deck,Pretty overrated in my opinion. Yes the view is gorgeous but it‚Äôs literally one lookout point and it‚Äôs ridiculously crowded on the weekends. Not super worth the trip up and honestly feel there are better views in other parts of Baguio.
Mines View Observation Deck,"A majestic place with beautiful scenery. However, you do need to pay attention to the fog. There will be moments that there will be so much that there will be nothing to see. If it seems a little foggy in the city reschedule your trip if the view is more important than the wonderful side attractions and authentic food.Love to witness an amazing sunrise behind the meadows, in the cold foggy morning, head to mines view park, and reach to the observations point. it is really interesting place to visit with family. there are Plenty of craft stalls and souvenirs. so that you can collect the things what you want. Costumes to try on for a small fee representing local culture, horses to sit on for photographs. A place that's got real attraction. The marvelous viewing gallery over the valley. I would recommend that you make this a stop off point if you are near Baguio."
Mines View Observation Deck,"The view is magnificent where you can see the horizons of Baguio and Alphaland country Club is visible from Mines View.Compare to my last visit before pandemic, they already have an entrance fee of Php10.00. Several renovations has been done and the comfort rooms was improved. There are more Tiangge‚Äôs where you can buy Pasalubongs and Souvenirs.HorseBack photo ops starts at Php50.00Traditional Clothing photo ops starts at Php100.00A picture with the St. Bernard dog is Php100.00You will still get the same classic feeling of Mines View Park!Follow me for more review critics!"
Mines View Observation Deck,This is a famous tourist spot so there are tons of people. A lot of souvenir and plant shops inside too. You can also rent costumes inside for only 30 pesos and take pictures with the big fluffy dog and pink horses for 100 pesos. The view in the observation deck is breathtaking.Entrance fee: 10 for adults and 5 for kids
Mines View Observation Deck,"Very busy place with lots of visitors. Entrance fee is just 10php per head. Aside from the view, there are also horses and dogs which you can take picture with. Pasalubong stores are found inside and outside Mines View. Plus there are bulalohan restos around the place."
Mines View Observation Deck,Always a nice place to get a view of Baguio. My friend told me to go here on sunrise but I wasn't able to. Nice place to buy plants and souvenir as well. The sellers that we talked to were all nice.
Mines View Observation Deck,Great place to explore with 10 pesos entrance fee. You can also see plant shops inside and astonishing view.
Mines View Observation Deck,"The entrance fee is only P10/adult and less if you're a PWD/Senior/Child.  Please follow social distancing protocols (yes - wear that face mask)You can actually bring someone like your elderly mother on a wheelchair down the wheelchair ramp that goes all the way down - and the security guard/staff will gladly assist you to bring them down and up the winding wheelchair-accessible path.  Please give the friendly security guard a tip too for the free help.They've got it all inside the park - the pink ponies with P50 for solo shots or P100 for a group shot (guide tells you to do a 'wacky' pose), the Igorot costume-for-hire, the St Bernard dogs too.And it's great to buy succulents and other plants on sale - heck, even the strawberries too (if you know the prices of strawberries being P350/kg - you can always ask the seller to top-off her box on sale).  Plus other food items and souvenirs on sale.It's cheesy, it's corny, it can be loud and I wouldn't go here if it was too crowded.  But if you're an old Baguio regular - you gotta check out the much-improved park that is Mines View Park.  Before you know it - they'll be doing the Mines View glass walkway similar to what's been done in China, the Grand Canyon, etc."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Park is an overlook park on the northeastern outskirts of Baguio in the Philippines. It is five kilometers away from the Heart of Baguio, passing through the Botanical Garden, the Mansion House, Wright Park, and the Pacdal Circle. Entrance fee is ten pesos."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Wide, open area. Bikes, boating, jogging, any and all park things, you can do here. Walking distance from a lot of great places around the city and... Night market!!!"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mind blowing views. Pink horses. Rediculous ""covid precautions"". Being charged ""cano"" prices on things vs what locals paid. What's not to love? A seemingly random golden gate bridge in the botanical gardens. Random wooden carved keychains."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Kind of disappointed when we got there. Was hoping to see a beautiful and majestic landscape but was just a normal mountain view. I've seen more beautiful landscape on the way up and not on the main road, and the place was packed! Love the stores though. Honestly I think this place was overrated IMO.We took an alternative road through Asin. Super windy, uphill,  crazy hairpin turns and off-camber banking! (Love it!)."
Mines View Observation Deck,"We were here during the weekend. So I wanted to come very early to avoid the crowds. As early as 6:30am, there are people already there. They were kind enough to avoid being in your picture, which is great. I highly suggest that you go early or else it will be harder to avoid having photo bombers."
Mines View Observation Deck,The view was lovely! Less tourist on weekdays. There are a lot of selling pasalubong in this area. Pwede kang tumawad ng price. We decided to buy pasalubong here in Mines View cause its a long queue in Good Shepherd. Nice place to visit.
