Burnham Park,"An excellent place for family and friends to visit. It has no entrance fees, and has a lake where you can ride a boat (P 150) and park grounds where you can ride small bikes (P 100). Not a place I would recommend at night as it gets quite dark here at some spots. But the morning is a superb experience you will definitely want to come back to."
Burnham Park,"A lovely place to be on a nice day.We were pleasantly surprised and very pleased at how long a period of time that we had aboard our boat on the lake.You may hire bicycles(some carrying as many as three people)on the cycle track for a modest fee,and once again the period of time allowed is most generous indeed ~ so it is good value for money.Spend time here is amazing. I love the place."
Burnham Park,"Definitely one of the best places to visit in Baguio. 💖 Burnham Park is a crowded tourist destination, but for good reason. The assortment of flowers that you will see in the park is truly breathtaking.Aside from sightseeing, you can also do boating, have your picture taken by a photographers' cooperative in tribal clothes, rent cars or bikes, and play at the amusement park."
Burnham Park,I have always been looking at this park ever since 2018. I only had the chance to review the park because I flexed the view of this park to my Japanese friend so that he can go here someday. Still crowded as ever. There's a lot of tourist as always. It is still fun to see everyone having fun here.
Burnham Park,Very beautiful park with boating and cycling available inside the park. Good place to relax and have clean air. Whenever I visit Philippines I make sure to visit Burnham park each time.
Burnham Park,A lot cleaner and crowd is more manageable more than ever. Police presence is constant so you feel more safe. More public CR are around and increased number of evenly spread out trash bins. Just make sure you do your part and clean as you go.
Burnham Park,Bring something to protect you from the heat of the sun when going up in this place. family vehicles are not  allowed to go up to this point because the area where you will see a good view of the tower and the west Philippines sea is not wide enough  for vehicles. tricycle fare per trip is 50 pesos as of 2022 with a maximum of 3persons per trip.
Burnham Park,"I/we enjoyed Burnham Park. We visited when it was busy and mellow, day and night. Felt safe. Numerous low level things to do for all ages. Fun to see nostalgic things to do (bumper cars, bike/pedal rentals) all sorts of food vendors, even massage people (but not sure where that happens).We had a picnic and someone offered (and we bought) blue tarp to sit on.Recommend and would return but wouldn’t call it a must see.Parking is hard to come by so walk or get dropped off is key."
Burnham Park,"Burnham Park is considered to be one of the most famous parks in the country. It is located on Jose Abad Santos Drive, Baguio City 2600 Benguet Philippines. A park is a popular place for both locals and tourists. This place is often full-packed with people regardless if it is rainy or not. The most well-known activity in the park is “biking”. There are lots of bicycles for rent at a very decent price. It is an excellent activity for youngsters and adults."
Burnham Park,"The place was also nice to see in the morning especially trying activities a family can enjoy like biking, riding a boat and having picnics. There are food area and lots of rest rooms. Parking is just hard during peak season. (Forgot to take pics since we just visit first in the evening for the night market 😊). The night market is beside the park."
Burnham Park,The best place to have a relaxing time after a long day or week. Most especially on a really nice weather. Have a sit in one of the benches around the park while sipping your freshly brewed coffee or any fave beverage. This is a not to miss place. Free and worth it!
Burnham Park,"Very busy during daytime, glad that we are almost back to normal now. Bikes, Tricycle, boat, etc. for rent are very affordable/cheap. Just the right price. Clean area minus the color of the lake's water."
Burnham Park,"A great place for a trip with your family, friends and your partner!-There are available paddle boat operators that you can rent from 200-350 pesos.-Bikes can be rented from 75 pesos up to 150 pesos that is already good for 30 minutes.Location is strategic. There are several walking distance establishments where you can eat and jeepney vehicles are just nearby."
Burnham Park,I love walking around baguio especially at Burnham Park because you can see a lot of flowers around the park. You can also do many recreational activities like biking and riding a boat. They also have food stalls once you got hungry! This park is also near markets.
Burnham Park,"one of our favorite places in Baguio. Unfortunately, only those checked-in or with membership are allowed to visit. they have golf and other sports activities, great food, activities for children, clean and spacious rooms, and very near to camp john hay."
Burnham Park,Burnham Park is a good place to stroll both night and day. There are paid parking lots around the area you have to pick the area where you will be staying for a long time to prevent longer walks.We took the boating at night and it is more beautiful and silent than in the morning. We paid ₱150 for the boat plus additional ₱50 because we were tired to row the boat.We wanted to try roller skates but it was already closed at 7PM. The bump car was the other ride we were able to try it was ₱100/5 mins/head and with a weight limit.
Burnham Park,Big park with plenty of space to do a variety of activities offered by the park or on your own. Many restrooms situated around the park as well as food stops. Not many restrooms open when it gets dark. Not sure I've seen many trash bins but the park seemed to be well maintained from garbage
Burnham Park,The park offers a lot of activities and is well known for the boat ride. You may choose what you want to do there and enjoy the weather while doing your activities.
Burnham Park,"Things to do around Burnham Park are:- Have a boat ride in the lake- Rent a bike to ride around- Walk around the park- Eat local food- Learn a little about history of the place.NOTE: There are locals who would suddenly stand near you and sing a song and ask for donation. It is up to you if you would give them. There are also locals who will offer you a massage for Php100.00.At weekends, it can be crowded. If you want a much quiet time, go on weekdays.There is a night market that pops up beside the park. It's a whole street of people selling products such as souvenirs, shirts, jackets, and a separate area for food."
Burnham Park,"Always iconic 🌻 Haven't been here for so long despite my distance, but it's due to some busy schedules and some usual distractions. Indeed, if you wanna ponder over things and genuinely cry while walking down the park like I did this early morning. Early as 4, 5 or 6AM is perfect if u wish for a wider space & less people. Meeting joggers too on the way pictures a healthy environment while the cold breezy wind dances.Tired now, benches are free, yet cold ha-ha!Burnham Park is 💞"
Burnham Park,It's a nostalgic visit for me. There you still have the man made lagoon where tourist can go on boating. There's these biking & cart area where kids & children alike can while away time waiting for their elders. Not far off is the market where fresh produce can be bought & taken as pasalubong.
Burnham Park,"Great park for a walk. In the middle you can rent a boat for a boat riding around P200 for 30 mins. On the upper part there was an amusement park with skating rink and or you can rent a bike, price depends on what bike youll rent. Overall its an enjoyable place with the family."
Burnham Park,"Had we arrived during day time, we would have relished the beauty of Burnham Park to the brim. We visited there late in the evening, but we still captured the spirit of fun and calmness that this park had offered to us. Thank you people of Baguio City. Your Burnham Park is superb!"
Burnham Park,"Gone are the glory days of this park but still the local government find ways to improve the park to be more attractive to local tourist you can paddle boat ,bike ,take a picture and taste of strawberry Taho  and Also nkt forget the cold weather"
Burnham Park,"This place is iconic and sits at the heart of the city. No Baguio trip is complete without this stop as a staple.Upside: there are lots of activities you can do in this park, including boating, biking, and skating. Early in the morning, there are also different workout groups you can join (Zumba, Tai Chi, etc) At night, Harrison Street is closed for the pop-up night market. There are nice policemen helping out with directions and making sure there are no peddlers. You can have a picnic here. Every street that surrounds the park has enough going--food places, souvenir shops, ukay stores, gas station. Name it. Easy to get taxis too.Downside: when in Baguio always keep your purse in front of you. Their streets are known for petty thefts. This last trip during the pandemic we felt safer and more relaxed. Restrooms are old, they aren't that clean. You have to pay up and some cubicles are squat toilets. Just do your numbers back where you're staying.Do we recommend this place? Yes.Are we going back? Yes."
Burnham Park,"Since we came there late at night, obviously I can no longer make a detailed review of the place. Anyways, from where we sat down, I still can see the beauty of the lake. There are still a lot of people going to and from my bench. Expectedly, the place is cold. Too bad I don't have anyone with me to cuddle. Hahahaha. Will be visiting the place again soonest I will be back in Baguio."
Burnham Park,"A place for the family and groups of people. It has everything from entertainment to relaxation, from skating rinks to bikeways to fun rides and food. Parking is quite difficult to come by, so you have to be patient to get one."
Burnham Park,"Its not complete for a tourist/visitor not to see this restored park b4 he leaves the city. Walk to see and take selfie with the (dont pick) flowers, grounds, boats, trees and fountains around. The lake has few fishes and different boats designed for you to have fun rowing or just ride. Also Join free zumba or just run and walk around best every (early) dewy mornings (sometimes to catch up fogs) . Located at the center of the city and its accessible to all transportation areas some with mini buses that offers free sakay going to the mall, market, cathedral.... Accessible to food houses, recreational centers, grocery, coffffeeee shops, churches, night market, pasalubong stores, close to meetings, banks, schools and other universities, other govt entities and tge like. Youll find almost everything nearby malay mu pati jowa ma-nearby Burnham Park. So i suggest u walk. Rampa your beauty and the pogi looks😁 and its good for your health walking. Enjoy. See more and have fun staying in Baguio City."
Burnham Park,"Wallow in the cold breeze and peace here in Burnham Park Reservation.Just before leaving Baguio, my friends and I settled to hit this park for photo ops of course.We rambled the area despite the fact that in a few hours we'd leave for Manila.Noticing the kayaks afloat the lagoon, we agreed to ride one. Each has an oarsman (unlike our experience in Villa Escudero that we ought to learn how to row a canoe because no staff will go with you) yet some of us take turns in rowing our vessel. And we enjoyed it!I have forgotten if the ride is 30 minutes or more. What I vividly recall is our conversation the whole time. We amused ourselves talking about the presentiables and teasing our oarsman of it though he never really revealed who was he in favor of. The lad who rode with us is a college students according to him. In my guess, they are working to support their education. I don't know but the staff are of the same ages so I thought that they work there in order to study. They wore blue t-shirt for their uniform. Hey, you can look for them should you decide to ride a kayak and you could help send them to school.It's not a only a park where you can ruminate about life in general but it's also a park where activities can be done. Come and have a peek of it."

Burnham Park,"Went here mid March, on the week of Panagbenga Festival. The park was decently maintained, not a lot of litter as expected, and there were park guards at the Grandstand, especially during the event.We also went in the evening to try out their boat rides (we paid around PHP200 for 30mins, and you can rent out a boater as well if you can't row your own boat for Php50 additional fee). Definitely a decent place with benches if you want to relax and have a picnic for free. They also have bikes for rent if you want to roam around the park.Accessibility to the park maybe a little bit hard as they have designated gates for vehicle entry. If you're travelling via taxi, the drivers can only drop you off at certain gates."
Burnham Park,"Lots of things to enjoy in Burnham Park!First, you can go boating and you’ll have plenty of choices. You can ride the basic boats (manual rowing) for 30min at 150-200php or add 50php if you’re not fit for rowing and someone will do it for you. 😆 There are also boats that move by pedaling at 250php for 30min.Cycling is also fun. You can choose a bicycle, tricyle or a 4-wheel kart which cost 50-75php for 30 min. Just beware of the reckless drivers (mostly kids)!You can also have photoshoots from traditional photographers with the Igorot attire in this park. They take decent pictures and even guide you to pose for better experience. They charge 75php per 5R picture and will also send you soft copies via facebook.Fooodies! Even with the cold weather, you can never resist the strawberry and avocado ice cream. It’s at least 35php per cone (cheaper than what we bought in La Trinidad). There are also strawberry and ube taho, cotton candies, green mangoes, pomelo, guava and more which you can munch while walking or sitting.Lastly, you can just walk around and enjoy the view and weather in this park. There are lots of benches around the park to eat and rest. I even saw some families bringing food and having a dry picnic there."

Burnham Park,Went there for Nostalgia. Not the park I remember from when I was younger but it was still fun.Still relatively clean and the facilities seem to still be adequately maintained.Water quality on the artificial lake could be better though.

Burnham Park,"Hopefully, the LGU will make an effort to make the place as beautiful as before or more during holidays.Christmas lights, decorations, and the Christmas tree are being liked by people in the park, thus it may have been a good project for the city.Locals and tourists love to go here to spend time with families and hang out with friends especially during weekends and holidays, so attracting designs will entice them to go often to the place which will eventually help the local businesses in the area as well.At night time of holidays when there are many people in the park, if there are designs, it would be a great opportunity to attract more tourists to go to the city.Additionally, regarding the waste, large garbage bins or regular changing of trash bags will also help in the problem of 'full bins' as some address.The place has been one of my favorite places to go since I was a kid and I wanted it to be the same with the locals and tourists.Also, we observed that the fountains are not being played already and it kind of disappoint me and others.This coming holiday, I hope that the fountains will be on."
Burnham Park,"The most iconic park of Baguio offers all kinds of activities. In the morning, you can jog and exercise around the perimeter and after that you can join the zumba dancing.

Burnham Park,"Everything here should have been perfect and I would have given this place a perfect score because of its vast green spaces and cool air, aside from the various sights. However, with regards to cleanliness, I cannot just overlook the plastic bottles, food wrappeds etc. Furthermore the rides are too expensive considering the pond water is so dirty and smelly. Furthermore, this place is not safe at night. One time, when we chanced upon this place at night, there are a lot of suspicious looking people tailing you and there are some offering sexual jobs. Plus, there are no police or security people at night."

I hope that they will reconsider this soon."

Burnham Park,"You can jog here in early mornings like at 5:00 am or so, do picnics, or just hang out. Take your time, take pictures, and relax. You can do other activities here as well, like badminton. There's few shelters against the sun here so noon is not a good time if you're cautious about the sun. There are more people here during weekends, night or day, so do be wary. Comfort rooms cost a fine but is cheap. Just look for any sings if you need it."
Burnham Park,"Best public park in the Philippines. Weather its day or night, its great a place to relax a appreciate its beauty."

Burnham Park,Great place for taking photos~ but can get a bit too crowded at times especially during holidays. I prefer going there during the rainy season (and sometimes during typhoons which is NOT recommended) just because there would be fewer people and getting epic shots becomes a lot easier.PS. Always guard your valuables. 😅😉
Burnham Park,"The park is easy to navigate. On specific nights, you get to enjoy the night market on its side as well. The park is livelier on day time when activities such as boating and cart driving is more appreciable. At night, its better to loik for local food on the side or get a good meal at good taste first before roaming around."
Burnham Park,I was so tired of walking the whole day that i just decided to sit and watch everything around me. They have different kind of bikes and boats to rent inside inside. Everybody will enjoy while chilling inside. It will bring back your childhood memories for some. Most of all there's a lot of bench everywhere that's why you'll easily find a spot for yourself.
Burnham Park,One of the best parks I've ever been to in the Philippines. I walk here almost every day. Perfect park for nature lovers. 🍂
Burnham Park,"Baguio is an historic place.A lot of Filipinos, like to spend their holidays in Baguio because of the cooler climate, it's very cluttered and to be fair probably over populated...I was there over Christmas and it was extremely crowded...so it would be unfair to be critical. If you are traveling in the area, it's well worth a, visit...there are some historical sights. The so called ""haunted"" Diplomat Hotel, Strawberry fields, Mines view lookout, Burnham Park, John Hay's eco trail..to name a few..."

Burnham Park,"A nice place to bring your family for picnic and playing. Boats, roller skates, and bikes are available for rent, nice view and ambiance."
Burnham Park,Burnham park is one of the most famous tourist destinations of Baguio. It's in the heart of Baguio and walkable from session road and the public market. Most people here just stroll or go boating. It's very near the night market as well so you if you don't have anything to do then there are certain things you can do here. Just be careful of pickpockets or those offering massages. Also sometimes the place can be very crowded
Burnham Park,"Visited at night.Pros: not to endure the humid daytime.Cons: cannot enjoy the view of the blooming flowers and the whole place because it is already dark.But we enjoyed the group bike activity, serve as an exercise and quality 30 min before the park closes that day. I would love to visit again if the temperature is lower than 20-ish to really enjoy the cold Baguio."
Burnham Park,"Amazing place for leisure, picnic, family bonding and more! I even enjoyed skating with friends."
Burnham Park,"What I love about this place is the night market or bazaar. Every 9PM till midnight a main road around Burnham Park is always closed down to give way for this. If you're interested in flea markets this is a place to check. They sell jackets (winter, leather,denim), pants, shoes, ladies bags, head wears for an affordable price. Plus if you're into street food that got it they even have Korean street foods. Good way to load up on carbs before legging up the market. The local folks here are very friendly. The taxi cab drivers are very polite. No worries. Hotels in Baguio are very decent and air conditioning is optional most of them none very cold here. If you're visiting this part of the country this is a must visit. In the daytime Burnham Park have a lot of activity for the whole family to offer. Bikes, and boat rides..lot's of restaurant and eatery around."
Burnham Park,Burnham Park is very clean.  It is senior- and kid-friendly. It's not too crowded in the morning (as of Nov 2021) since Baguio City is still controlling the number of incoming tourists. Will definitely go back when we return to Baguio.
Burnham Park,"The park has improved since my last visit last year. :) However there are still some slides that are not fully repaired and aome swings are not fully functional. Nonetheless, the effort to maintain the functionality of the whole park is commendable."

Not just this park but Baguio as a whole. and i love the way the street sellers food and crafts..."
Burnham Park,"I've visited this park a couple of times. If you've been here before, you wouldn't want to go biking or boating again especially when the lake water looks filthy and when the biking area was divided by an ongoing road construction making it very crowded. On the good side, there are a lot of good restaurants around this park."
Burnham Park,"Place has lots of people and is back to its former glory! Wear your masks and don't entertain those that offer massages as social distancing should still be in effect, the authorities will fine both of you if you do."
Burnham Park,"The restroom is SO dirty. Like most of the restrooms I've been to during my Baguio trip, it was paid, so you would at least expect some level of maintenance but there was none. The ube taho I had here was straight up sugar syrup and not ube at all. There were some unpleasant experiences with vendors :("

Lol.Since it's peak tourist season, the crowd is just overwhelming when I visited. There are paths less trodden and with very minimal people though for your enjoyment of the breathtaking scenery minus the noise pollution."
Burnham Park,I don't know in which point I will review it but if it would be according to the part that it was a park it was good but not as good as other parks but the location of Baguio city make it better
Burnham Park,"The lake is cleaner than pre-pandemic days. Plenty of food places and restrooms, as well as picnic areas. Good for a variety of activities from walking to rowboats. It can get pretty crowded, though, especially during weekends and holidays, so if you are looking for relaxation, come on weekdays."

Burnham Park,It was a very fun experience with family and friends.
Burnham Park,"This park is absolutely wonderful! A place of joy and laughter. This place is nice as you can ""chill""  and is child friendly. The place is clean and with a lot of activities. You can try the boat in the lake for around 50-60 pesos, and your kids can also rent a bike for only 20-50 pesos! Budget friendly! Also, there are a lot of taho vendors with the MUST TRY strawberry taho! It costs 30 pesos. I recommend you try their ube halaya taho. That stuff is heavenly"
Burnham Park,"A good place to go for a vacation with your family and friends. There's a lot of foods to choose from and the people are friendly.Fun fact about Burnham Park:The park is named after Daniel Hudson Burnham, an American architect and urban planner. He was also the one who laid the plans and design for Baguio City. Most of the park’s features were originally from Daniel Burnham’s design but a few changes and alterations were made to enhance the park’s beauty."
Burnham Park,"Although located at the center of a busy city... Burnham park offers the peaceful, serene and tranquill place to relax. Fresh air, street foods and open wide spaces... a place for any age group. The only drawback is the limited parking space as ratio to visitors."
Burnham Park,Went there during the end of Ramadan.It was a holiday but also off season so I think there were relatively less people than usual. there were areas in the park that were bustling with people but generally the place was quiet and a good place to walk around in the morning.saw several groups holding zumba/tai chi events for health (most participants were ladies/old people) while in other areas families/friends were having picnics and just hanging out. there's also a special area where you can rent bikes and play aside from the swan boats for rent in the pond.I recommend trying the Strawberry Taho vendors were selling for only Php. 30!
Burnham Park,"Burnham Park is obviously a tourist destination close to the city center. Tourists can enjoy biking, boating, and buying some plants in the orchidarium adjacent to the park. It is also convenient and accessible, so we advise tourists do some exercise or use public transport.Join the locals exercise and dance at the park from early to late morning here. You'll appreciate the park if it's less crowded.The lights can be enjoyed here when the nightlight bites. Lightings are installed all over the park. More festive lights are enjoyed here at Christmas, though."
Burnham Park,Nice park for socialising/walking in the city of Baguio.
Burnham Park,"Welcome everyone to our Baguio city Burnham park,a snap shot while passing by."

You can try biking and boat riding, there is also a rollerskating rink near by. Depending on the time of the year there are also events within the area.  And at night the front of the park becomes the also famous Baguio night market where you can buy tons of items. The park is very easy to reach since it is near the busa terminal and the SM Baguio."
Burnham Park,It was my first time there yesterday. I asked for a fresh donut. I didnt get one. The place wasnt busy or anything.  So sad. But i asked for ice and they complied. You have to buy 6 donuts for them to put it in a box. Donuts are large. 1 inch high and 4.5. In diameter. Good or sharing if you areused to krispy kremes. The taste reminded me of eating donuts in Baguio City's John Hay (when the americans were still there). For some donuts they have on offer buying two krispy kremes would be more efficient. Good to try at least once. Not all flavors available. Holiday creations were available when i visited
Burnham Park,"It's a big park in Baguio that i never missed to go to whenever we're around. A lot things going on in the place. The park is ideal for walking and jogging also for a weekend-picnic with the family. There's a man-made lake where anyone could test their paddling skills and go boating ( your option to go on your own or together with a boatman). Of course, that comes with a fee. A wide area to test your biking skills. Rent is minimal. Stalls selling souvenirs like handwoven bracelets, key chains, ref magnets, and the likes are everywhere so you'll have the chance to grab a present for your friends and loved ones. Must visit when in the city of pines!"
Burnham Park,Looks like Baguio is back to normal. Lots of kids enjoying the bike rides and open space
Burnham Park,"Perfect place for your kids, enjoy doing different activities like boating , biking and riding bump cars ."
Burnham Park,When you are boring living in crowded place. Why don't you try to relax and feel the nature. Im always in the Baguio because i fell in love to the place. Pine-tree and there's alot of flower and of course the weather. Its cold even you are just in the Philippines. One way bus trip pitx to baguio that's its just sleep in the bus when you wake up you are in the baguio 😊😊😊.
Burnham Park,"Ideal place to hang around with your love ones. Biking, boating, jogging are some the activities to choose from. I won’t get tired going back to this place to spend my afternoon."
Burnham Park,"So crowded now.  You will see the rose garden, but not that full of roses, unlike before. The one i noticed, the prices of renting bikes, are so cheap as well as in boating. P100/boat (4 pax max), if u would like to have a rower, you will pay him P50 for 30 minutes."
Burnham Park,Nice place.. you need to park your car in nearby  and dont go there in weekend
Burnham Park,"The most visited tourist spot in Baguio. This place gets very crowded at times, so it's best to go here very early if you're up for some photo ops. Even the biking area gets very congested, so be careful. You don't want to shorten your trip because of an injury.This place is very big so be wary of your companions especially kids. It is also good for joggers beacause of its vastness. Also, zumba classes on weekends at every corner(just follow the loud music).I just wish they would clean the water in the boating area, the smell denotes very diry water. I remember going here years ago when the pond has fishes and jumps on your boat.I also don't advice going/passing here at night or very early for safety reasons."
Burnham Park,Nice place. Best for the family.
Burnham Park,"Great place to spend the day= boating, cycling, walking, skating and if there are kids, they will playground is . Also near church. Accessible to every establishments."

Burnham Park,"The heart of Baguio City, atleast fo me that is. You cant say you've been to Baguio if you havent visited Burnham Park. The best place to go where you don't know where to go.  I forgot the prices for the boat rides. There shop nearby if you wanna go eat or drink. There are a lot of people but it usually isnt a problem cause the place is big. You can always find a place to sit whether on a bench, a sidewalk, or even on the grass. Numerous couples make this place their meeting/dating spot. There are bike shops where you cant rent bikes but only on the designated track though. The place is also nice at night"
Burnham Park,Crowded on Sunday afternoon but if you went late at night there will be less people. Though expect there are a lot of Christmas carolers in the vicinity. In a span of 30 mins shelled out 4 times for 4 diff groups. Still quiet and relaxing place to stay
Burnham Park,"Its a very nice and comfortable place to go to in Baguio City. So many amenities to enjoy such as skating, jogging, biking, boat riding, etc. It also has that environmental feel for those types of people that usually wants to unwind with nature."

Burnham Park,Family bonding good here at Burnham Park
Burnham Park,"amazing park with lagoon. best experience, riding a boat"
Burnham Park,Our family went on a weekend vacay and it was so fun! A lot of tourists around and the bike lane was full. There are no single bikes but there are bikes for kids and adults. 50pesos/30mins or you can go for the two seater for 75pesos/35mins. We will go back this aug2022. It was raining in the night so be sure to bring an umbrella when you go out.
Burnham Park,"You don't have  anywhere to park, it's best to find a suite, place, or hotel nearby so you can just walk from there. The parking really is terrible if there's alot of people or peak season of tourist specially their annual panagbenga festival. All in all its a nice place to spend with family."

Burnham Park,"With the amount of tourist visiting the area, comfort rooms must have seen a major improvements but there is none. Below basic. And they even collect fee."
Burnham Park,Place where you can relax with your family
Burnham Park,"We went there yesterday for the holiday. As expected, the park was crowded. Even the part where people go biking and do other fun rides looked like there was a traffic jam of go carts and bicycles. Even boats bump into each other in the boating area. It was understandable since it's vacation season. However, what irked me is the Pay CR. It asked 6 pesos for urinating ""with tissue"" lol, and they don't even have water to flush toilet with... They charge higher if you need to defecate but they'll only give you a bunch of tissue, still, no water. Just hoped there was proper maintenance since it's already paid... Other than this part, I think the visit was still enjoyable."
Burnham Park,Great buys for cheap prices. Security can be improved. Police visibility is not that great. A roving one might be needed to avoid pickpockets.
Burnham Park,"We have so much fun during our visit here with my family. The kids will surely enjoy activities like go carting, biking, roller skating, boating and it has a mini amusement park inside. You can try their rides at an affordable price. Once tired, you can also enjoy the food as there are a lot of stalls you can choose from. If you're on a budget you can just enjoy the view and walk inside the park, watch people around, etc. It's right at the center of Baguio, near the mall, hotels and markets. Not so much to share on photos as I enjoyed the personal experience."
Burnham Park,"It's peaceful place for jogging in early morning, enjoy the beautiful scenery Of the lagoon boats & friendly local people & foreign & local tourists roaming the big Burnham place..."
Burnham Park,I was there at night time only and it was raining. Looking for parking space was a challenge and nothing much was changed. I don't see a compelling reason to visit unless you on a motorbike and enjoy riding the twisties.
Burnham Park,"Nice place to take pictures...Biking, boating and skating are available here"
Burnham Park,"Nice place located at the heart of Baguio City. You can find several activities while you are there. Try rowing a boat or riding a family wagon! There are many street food sellers, too. Don't forget, always keep your wallet and phone safe!"
Burnham Park,"Fun place to be in when your in Baguio. Lots of outdoor activity such boat riding, bike riding and off course doing nothing and admiring the park 😜. Downside, it is very hard to find a parking spot. Be warned, if you park on a non public parking place, your plate nos will be taken by authorities. 😲"
Burnham Park,"It's a big park with man made lake where you can go boating or biking on the other side of the the park. It's a favorite tourist destination so you have to expect that it's crowded. You can see lots of families spending time here enjoying strawberry taho, ice cream and cotton candies while strolling around."
Burnham Park,"The best place and famous park lol. Very easy to reach because its withing the city. Many hotels, restaurants, and many things to do like bike renting,  boat riding, relaxing, photo op w/ the famous ifugao traditional clothes and 3 to 5 mins walk going to SM City Baguio"
Burnham Park,It was such a nice visit in Burnham Park.
Burnham Park,A very great place to exercise since there is a lot of people that would motivate you  because your not the only one working out or could also be a great place to meet an old time friend.
Burnham Park,"Boat ride @ 200php unli, 4 wheel bikez @ 75,50 php for 30 min, ztrawberrry taho and dirty ice cream for 35 and 50 php cupz.. come early parking iz a challenge @ the parking for 35 php for the 1zt 2 hourz.."

Burnham Park,"Burnham Park is so wide and big. Use google map to get to where you wanted to be. There are food stalls here as well as tiangge stalls and souvenir stalls. You can also go paddling boats in the lake (located at its heart), go jogging, there is also zumba every morning, and bike rentals. Comfort rooms are also available here, 5 pesos per head, bunch of people in the park equals long lines in the comfort room. Enjoy!"
Burnham Park,Lots of fun activities for the kids ❤️❤️
Burnham Park,"Great for family bonding. Lots of activities to do, from biking to boat rides. The park becomes more interesting during Christmas season, where they reveal their giant Christmas tree design for the year."
Burnham Park,"This is the first time I went to Burnham Park.This place is definitely perfect for picnic bonding.(You must make sure you clean as you go to save the beauty of Burnham Park.)You can even rent a bike and ride on a boat.The only two things I didn't like was it was a bit overcrowded and too many cars passing by. 😂But overall, this is a must-visit place for Baguio.(sidenote: Here are some of my photographs at Burnham Park)"
Burnham Park,Great park!  Loved the lights at night.  Beware of people offering massages.  You will be prosecuted.
Burnham Park,One of the nicest in baguio to spend quality time with family
Burnham Park,"Nice place for family outing and good tourist spot but can be more organized in parking. And put up more signs insude the place. Playground is great for kids very safe. It has boat rides, biking, mini carnival old style and lots of things to eat and buy. And very nice flowers. Can put more trashcans especially of its peak season."
Burnham Park,It's a good place to do visit you can attend zumba/taebo  or other activities in the morning and kids can enjoy the newly renovated children's park
Burnham Park,People's park.Everyone can enjoy.the  boat ride.or simply walking around.they also offer rides for children.

Burnham Park,Felt like a tourist!Boat ride was 150 pesos per hour which is okay.
Burnham Park,Its very family oriented park. You can enjoy rowing on the lake on board a swan boat.
Burnham Park,We went here before the pandemic and it was my 1st time..i just loved the place  
Burnham Park,"It still has some charming spots but overall, the park feels rundown and is perpetually overcrowded. The lake looks especially stressed. Maybe it’s time to close it for some time to give it some much needed rehabilitation."
Burnham Park,"I enjoyed biking!It was fun! I tried all sorts of bikes and there are plenty to choose from. If you ever get hungry from all the biking, there are dozens of food stalls you can choose from. The ice, the strawberry and ube taho are a must-try.This perfect for family occasions or if you want to spend some quality time with a loved one. Just remember, be prepared for the cold and rainy season. You might need some thick coat and some gloves and mask.Try different kinds of bikes to double the fun.One note to remeber though, the lagoon in the center needs some cleaning as there is quite a bit of unpleasant smell lingering around the area."
Burnham Park,So much fun when you are with your family and friends. It is indeed a park that needs to be preserved. Alot of activities surrounds the park.
Burnham Park,Renovations happening right now. Not the best time to visit specially after a night of rain... But... The Rose Garden and the flowers will give you a good morale boost.
Burnham Park,"An experience that was enjoyable, the Colors of Baguio and the Cordillera . I am so honored to be one of the Judges @ The Panagbenga Festival. The Final event after the Parade was held here @ The Burnham Park.A place to visit and experience , an attraction truly enjoyed thru the years."
Burnham Park,It is a beautiful park for everyone but it's in people's hand how to handle it as well as their moral to clean or leave garbage around
Burnham Park,I just love spending my freetime here. Watching families paddling the swan boat. No worries. Hakuna Matata.😍P.S. try going at sunset. Take some photos. Very nice
Burnham Park,Nothing beats the classic. Its not Baguio city without this park. Surely is a melting-pot. Almost always crowded during the day especially on weekends and on peak seasons. If crowd is not your cup of tea dont visit this park on peak seasons; but if you want to experience Baguio to the core especially for first-timers in this cold and happy little city then Burnham is a must see. The pictures/shots i took are taken around midnight at the park which means no crowd (haha).
Burnham Park,"Well maintained gardens, cheerful atmosphere, lots to do, but quite popular and extremely difficult to find parking, sometimes even in their dirt lot."
Burnham Park,Still an immoral landmark at the heart of Baguio City
Burnham Park,"Burnham park is a very nice park and is accessible to restaurants, hotels/ accommodations and transportation.You will enjoy so many things because it offers a variety of activities to do like biking in different types of bikes, riding boats along the waters of burnham, taste strawberry taho of ice cream, etc. I enjoyed walking thru this park any part of the day.It is best when you got to hold someone hands while walking in this park may it be night or day. Will never get tired of going back to this park <3"
Burnham Park,"Nice park to stroll with kids! Many activities for kids and adults to enjoy like boating and biking.

Burnham Park,"Baguios well known park. Its amazing how the city is able to maintain this. You can have a picnic, boat ride, biking, skateboard. I like the flowers and pine trees"
Burnham Park,"All is good. No smoking. Not so noisy. I love the cold fresh air. Its just, too populated. Best time to be there I think on morning"
Burnham Park,Cool..and a cool place. :)
Burnham Park,"Up until now, its a very friendly and nice place to spend time"
Burnham Park,"A must place to visit in Baguio, rent and row a boat for 30 minutes,or rent a pedal cart and go racing just be careful lots of kids also rent here and try to get sweat because weather is cold in Baguio,clean restroom also available for a minimal fee."

Burnham Park,"I miss Baguio City! Together with my Boyfriend we celebrated our 2nd Anniversary here! Too bad he got sick during our rounds at this park but I really had fun and enjoyed our stay here at Burnham Park. Pine trees are everywhere, Happy faces and the Strawberry Ice cream is the best!!! I really love to ride the boat but there are too many tourist that rents the boat. If you want to know about our stay and places we visited at baguio, just visit the Youtube Channel of my Boyfriend: Burugista Vlog. Video of our stay in Baguio City is posted."
Burnham Park,"I gave it a 4 because I'm a Filipino. Cool weather, nice sceneries... but the lake color is not appealing."
Burnham Park,A place where a family & friends could always value & remember. 🧡
Burnham Park,Burnham Park Was Alright But They Need To Add more parking space. Because when we got there we had to wait 30 minutes Just to get Ourselves a parking spot
Burnham Park,"Try to atleast ride the boat for a unique experience and view of the area. Locals here are very nice and accommodating. Went here for day tour only. Got tired but still had fun, temperature not bad at all as expected for Baguio 😊"
Burnham Park,"The best park I've seen so far in the Philippines.Family  and friends  can go biking,  picnic,  boating  and rent traditional  costume and take photo over the lake and join  Zumba  session.We had so much fun !"
Burnham Park,Such a good place for fun and enjoyment
Burnham Park,"I visited Burnham when I was 5 or 6 years old. Back then it was clean, there was no much crowd. The Burnham lake has clear water, incomparable to what it is now. I remember somebody was giving food to the fish in there. Sometime in 2013, the gov't of Baguio changed the water of the lake, made some cleaning and clearing too, and hooray, the fish can be seen joyfully swimming. It was fun to row your boat in the lake before, but now, you'll just stand there wondering, whether the people really enjoy rowing and roaming around the sully lake🤔but besides it, there are still other things to enjoy at the park. The Children's park has now been opened to the public. I hope they're be guarded forward to ensure the equipment last long for everyone to enjoy. Picnics are also one of its strengths, the grassy areas serve as picnic areas for families to bond during weekends or holidays. The biking area too, lots of stories of my friends were them learning how to ride a bike, I tried one time I only got bruises😅and I still don't know how to ride. I concede, maybe it's something I don't have to learn. Welcome to Burnham Park, enjoy, make sure to take only pictures and make memories. Take part in the cleanliness of the park by disposing your wastes properly."
Burnham Park,Good place to walk around and relax or sit beside the infamous man-made lake.
Burnham Park,I love taking walks here!
Burnham Park,"I suggest going there only on weekdays if you are a local. It tends to get over crowded on weekends and stay away from ""masahista s"" they get so pushy and annoying and they charge like theyve got golden hands. I hope the local government regulates these people"
Burnham Park,"The place is excellent for recreation, photoshoots, vacation or even just a simple stroll. there are also a lot of different things to try like renting a boat, a on- person cart, a bike and more. there are also a lot of food and souvenirs on every corner."
Burnham Park,Good place to take pictures with friends and love ones.. See the beauty of the flowers that blossoms
Burnham Park,"Great place to do your early morning exercise. There are Zumba sessions around burnham park.Tourists tend to flock this place even during early morning especially during weekend.Please clean as you go when you use the picnic tables.Sometimes, garbage bins around the park are not enough to contain the trash of the tourists especially during holidays and long weekend.Lots of comfort rooms around the park ."
Burnham Park,"Stealing a quick stroll during one of those ECQ days... No other people, just the plants, the man-made lake and us."
Burnham Park,"This is one of the busiest tourist destinations in Baguio City because you and your family can enjoy a lot of activities here. You can try your rowing skills at the Burnham lake by renting a boat of your liking. Or you can try your cycling prowess by pedaling to your heart's content aboard a bike of your liking - from two wheeled, to three wheeled, to four wheeled, up to five wheeled bikes. When exhaustion finally gets you, you can relax and eat and drink at the many restaurants and eateries around the park."
Burnham Park,Great experience!! Climate is cozy and cool. People are very friendly and they are willing to help us navigate the place. They were able to keep the park clean and beautiful. One thing that I will never forget is when we ride a boat and we dont know how to move. Thankfully the caretaker is willing to help us explore the lake.
Burnham Park,"A beautiful park with a lot of fun activities. Best place to with family, lovely boat rides.Safe & Clean"
Burnham Park,good to walk in early morning .there's also a nearby shop for coffee to awaken your sleeping good mood ..
Burnham Park,Our group visited this place last October 2018. The park is quite big with a lake offering rides for P30 a person. Other than the lake there's no other attraction. I observed that the park is not maintained for   cleanliness.
Burnham Park,"The Burnham Park is huge and we actually watch the sunrise at the park, its quite peaceful and the ambiance of the park by the pond was tranquil in the early morning before the sun was set, even at that time a lot of joggers are already at the park and you will see a lot of people doing some kind of exercise, there was also a boat ride and swan boat ride at the park, with a small fee. There was also a group exercise such as zumba that you could join, and picnic table for you to enjoy your breakfast. Its a good place to visit and to walk around, perfect for yoga and meditation. It could get really crowded depending on the day and time of your visit. There is a nearby eatery besides the park and I would recommend you not to eat there, we wanted to try some local food but we hot an overpriced mediocre food with questionable sanitation."
Burnham Park,"At the heart of Baguio City. Your Baguio City trip won't be complete unless you visit Burnham park. Well through the years Burnham park continues to improve. Not just a place to be for travelers, but even the locals enjoy havinv their time here. Its because you cab do a lot of things here, ...kids can play, ride a bike or a bike with a side car for groups, or a two-seater bike for couples... friends/couples/barkadas can do boating..people can have picnics, or even just sit down and take a breather.

Burnham Park,A lot of happy memories here in burnham especially when you're with someone special. My favorite hello and my hardest goodbye.
Burnham Park,"If you want a chill place to go to Baguio, I recommend this place. You can sit here after buying food from night market. I suggest the benches near the lake, the breeze is colder. Street vendors are also selling their food here like mangoes and strawberry taho"
Burnham Park,"Park appears to be designed around the lake in. The middle.  Ample areas of shade and sun available to stay cool or warm up.  Nice children's park with enough space for many children to play on swings, seesaws or run around.   Recommend taking public transportation (jeepney, tricycle) as parking is hard to find.  The city of Baguio is designed around Burnham Park. Recommended to visit here when in the city for a nice stroll.  In February (for the entire month, there are flower displays for a contest).  No admission required; to be enjoyed by the entire family.  Panabenga is the name of the month long flower fedtival.  The displays are right next to the market/outdoor shops for food and/or goods for souvenirs."

Burnham Park,Burnham is a great place to lean on specially when you are alone and want to think

Burnham Park,"Strawberry Taho anyone? This is the City Park of Baguio with a man-made lake in the middle. The vibe in here is just like the Luneta Park back in manila though the difference is its cold out here plus you can rent a boat so you and your loved one can enjoy rowing in the lake. This place is good for families and couples even friends. Here, I tasted the Strawberry and Blueberry Taho, some say its not much different from the regular one, but I say its way different because of the strawberry syrup they put in had strawberry bits too! REMINDER: Smoking or Vaping is not allowed in any part of Baguio trust me, I learned it the hard way. The fine is not a joke, straight up 1k, no 1st or 2nd or 3rd offence, once you've caught. Its done."
Burnham Park,The weather is very very fine 😍
Burnham Park,"What I like Burnham is the many activities that you can do... Boat-ride, jog, bike ride, have picnic, photo taken wearing traditional clothing and or just plain chill at one of the benches. Baguio is known for its cool weather where you can bask safely under the sun and the park is just perfect! Looking forward to be back!"

Burnham Park,Great place for an evening out with friends. It's so clean and tidy. Lots to do there. The pedal go-carts are fun. Does get busy at night!
Burnham Park,Nice place.   Nice lake with small boats u can hire.   Don't expect too much here.  it is a bit overrated.   Try not to go during peak season.   So over crowed and traffic is worse than Manila. Don't expect to park within a a mile.  hehe.During peak season this city and attractions are completely over whelmed with super traffic.  It becomes a grid lock. To enjoy this city avoid peak times especially around xmas and new year.

Burnham Park,"Love the place to hang out with family, friends or someone"
Burnham Park,The best for Early morning Jogging..
Burnham Park,"Lots of trees and flowers. Burnham has been renovated and overall looks better. Restrooms are also improved. At times, we see security guards roaming around, though I still think they need to put a fixed guard outpost that is visible to the public."
Burnham Park,Go night biking with your colleagues and eat at rose garden.It's a great experience and bonding time.
Burnham Park,Boating...biking...beautiful and lovely roses in the rose garden. Flowers around the corner are sooo beautiful and the cold breeze. A nice place to have a picnic and put a tent for camping.

Burnham Park,It's overcrowded now.. The local government needs to do something in letting the place breath..
Burnham Park,A great place to unwind with the family especially the boat ride. The cycling is quite tiring in the legs. Theres also a place for kids to play and some strawberry taho vendor. Also dont get massage here.
Burnham Park,There's plenty of recreation inside. And it's a huge park. You may enjoy the famous Strawberry Tahoo here. Just look for the known permitted Tahoo vendor.
Burnham Park,"Nice place for occasional fun and activities, an ideal place for fun and family outings."
Burnham Park,"Same old family park, still a nice place to hang out in.  But the area is too congested.  Hard to find a parking space. Better to park somewhere else in Baguio and then just walk towards here."

Burnham Park,"A place where you can enjoy the cold breeze of air and boat riding (""what to sawa""). The Christmas season is the best season to visit where the park is being decorated with lights especially the Christmas tree. You can also have a great social media profile picture just wait for the night to come then take a picture next to a lamp post like what my friend Jerold did.And please be responsible for your trash."
Burnham Park,I love the place          its very clean

We just ate really quick dahil saglit lang din yung alloted time ng tour sa Burnham. I honestly don't understand how i can be a tourist in a place and yet feel like home. 💖I will always be back. 🌬️"
Burnham Park,Well ...Yes a tourist trap if there is one
Burnham Park,Hard to find a spot now in central Baguio to find relaxation. Too many people coming this yr
Burnham Park,It's a great experience I had in this particular landmark in Baguio. Burnham Park Place is awesome.
Burnham Park,"The park will be better when the guards/admin will not allow solicitation by ""churches""/cripples."
Burnham Park,"There are a lot of activities to do here. Some things that could be done would be to go try bike riding, boat rowing, let your kids lose at the childrens park, and occassionaly there are some stalls we call ""Tiage"" that offer various merchandise such as toys, clothes, bonnets, some variation of food and so much more. And if youre one of those people with green thumbs, there is an orchidarium close to it. I cant provide much pics but Baguio is truly an adventurous place. Try visiting Camp Jan Hae which provides activities such as Archery, Mini Golf, Horse back riding, paint ball, go carting and many more."

Burnham Park,"Best place for a stroll with kids, jogging around the area or stroll with pets."

Burnham Park,A park in the city center very accessible for tourist.
Burnham Park,Always a great time
Burnham Park,"Its located in Baguio City, Philippines. Its crowded on weekends. And theres not a lot of restaurant in the area unless you go out in the main road which will be the Session Road already. It means you have to leave the park and go along Session Road to find the restaurants and fastfood chains.No addition as to activities. Boat rowing and biking. It's not the same as when I was a kid. You can smell the pine before and the climate  is amazing.still I recommend Baguio City overall  because  theres other places to see and not just one."
Burnham Park,"Its like ""overcrowded""pag peek season"
Burnham Park,"When we came by its already night time, but the park is good place to spend your time with your family 👍I enjoyed riding the bike, i legit got tired 🤣✌"
Burnham Park,"Its a clean place, a lot of tourist, i recommend the swanboat instead of a regular paddle boat that we use, we had a picture wearing costumes for 75php for 1shot, theres a lot of zumba instructor everywhere but dont expect for cheap stuff or anything free to enjoy..Everything in baguio is expensive as a tourist."
Burnham Park,Nice place and clean as usual

Burnham Park,Town officials should implement a weekly clean drive atleast so that the park will look clean.
Burnham Park,"I wish people keep their trash to themselves or throw them properly. It is a relaxing place to unwind, jog and have fun for a chill day. Quarantine days gave us a lot of peaceful walking in the park. Went rhere with colleagues and it was very enjoyable days just that a lot of trash of fastfood left in the different corners, tashbins are full. Still enjoyable to watch people enjoing the day in a cold place like this in December, the summer capital of the Philippines."
Burnham Park,"good place to unwind and people watch.  you can go boating in the lake, go biking, watch the dancing fountain, eat street food and enjoy the view!"
Burnham Park,"Great park for walking with friends and jogging during early mornings.There are boats to rent on the lake, a skating rink, a small theme park, a children's park, a flower garden, a track and swimming pool and bike rentals around the bend. The best thing is it's never to far from any major commercial area since it's literally in the middle of the city. Definitely a go too if you're visiting Baguio City or just a local looking to cool off"
Burnham Park,Never forget to bring a coat or thick jacket during night strolls.
Burnham Park,The place is as expected. Traffic is bad since there are construction works around the park.

Burnham Park,"Best for family time and lazy mornings and afternoons in Baguio. However, there are too many people when we visited on a Sunday morning. Social distancing is observed but some areas get too crowded. Kids are allowed to roam. Boat ride is also affordable for Php 150 unlimited use. We stayed there for only around 30 mins but totally enjoyed the experience. There's also an area where flowers are displayed and we had photo ops there. Overall, still recommended for travellers who don't want to think on what to do at all. Just go there and chill."

The thing that is a bit of a set off is the number of tourists all day and night but I still enjoyed pedalling in the Burnham lake despite that.
Burnham Park,"This place is really perfect for vacation, especially with your family and friends. The view is really good; I really like their offers and services. Locals are really friendly and kind."
Burnham Park,It's so beautiful....fog all around you.

Burnham Park,Very nice place to hangout with the family boating and bicycle is the highlight of the place
Burnham Park,"We were able to ride the boat at the Burnham Lake. Having much fun and feeling free rowing with the pedal. (forgot if this the right term) 😁. Next time we'll try the bicycles. Its been a long time since i ride one, 10ish maybe. But as my husband said, once you know how to drive it you'll not forget it. 👍"
Burnham Park,"Went here June 17. Fun experience for the kids. They went on the kart racing lane, enjoyed it very much after a very long time in lockdown in Manila. Appreciate that kids are allowed here, everyone follows health protocols which keeps the place safe. Went on a boat and it was relaxing not too many people and the weather was just right sunny yet not so hot cause the breeze is cool. Went walking around the park. The orchidarium is close to burnham if you are a plantita you cam visit this place."
Burnham Park,Had a good walk in the park and watched the sunset. The park is clean and have all kinds of activity to enjoy. I loved the boat ride.🚤 There are also bicycles for rent for all ages. There is a beautiful lagoon to walk around for a nice breezy exercise.   I also enjoyed street food..peeled green mangoes with shrimp paste was a delightful treat.😄
Burnham Park,"the place is fun for kids and adults.you can stroll thru the park while the kids are enjoying the for rent bicycles.the place has a separate children's park where kids can put all their energies sliding, swinging, and other fun activities."
Burnham Park,One of the memorable places here in Baguio City. This place is well maintained and lots of physical and leisure time activities can be done here.
Burnham Park,"Experience the rides in paddling boats which is exhausting, especially if you have asthma. The swan boat is less exhausting because you do not use your arms to paddle but your legs to pedal."
Burnham Park,Tambay place... Specially because the weather is good. Enjoyed my walk around this place.
Burnham Park,"A fun place with lots to do!  Our family loved the pedal gocarts, which we rode for 30 minutes!  The boat ride was lots of fun too!  We rode on a duck boat our 3 year-old daughter picked out.   There are lots of food, clothing, and jewelry vendors all over the park.  I wish we had a place like this in the United States!!!"
Burnham Park,A very very relaxing place to chill when there aren't much people which usually is around at really early morning or evening. Its still good to visit even when there are many people.
Burnham Park,Few people and everyone is using face shield and mask and maintaining social distancing!
Burnham Park,Great scenery plenty of places to just sit and relax. Children have lots of open spaces to play and just be kids. Usually some activities in progress year round. Boating lake and cycle path for the more energetic also Zumba sessions in the morning.  Great photo op area also
Burnham Park,"Great place to take kids. we went to the kart place for only 50 each, the boat ride was around 150 to 250. Plenty of street food available for snacks. Only bad thing was the toilet its a hole in the ground and you need to pay 5 each, if you request for one with seats the toilets are dirty. Worth visiting tho."
Burnham Park,"Burnham Park is a nice place to spend time with your loved ones. There are bikes and boats that you can rent which are really fun. The park is large and great for picnics. There are also small stalls that sell snack foods and also some accessories, which are all at affordable prices. The only problem is that the park is usually very crowded and noisy so can be a little annoying. The park is also open until sun down so you have a lot of time to spend here.4 stars"
Burnham Park,"Good and cheap for you and the whole family. They have bike and boat rentals here or you can just sit on their benches or lie down on the green grasses. There's also a lot of food establishments nearby. Night market starts at 9pm and ends at 12am. A lot of people visits this place, so always be ready for heavy traffics. Enjoy!"
Burnham Park,Wonderful place
Burnham Park,"Best place for kids and family bondings.  Can do boating, bicycle, play on childrens' park, and picnic."
Burnham Park,it good
Burnham Park,This is where we normally walk with my son every Sunday morning. His favorite ube taho is must try by any visitors or tourists in the area.
Burnham Park,"hot in may, but still we enjoy the park"
Burnham Park,A nice park for a morning walk/jog. Great spot for zumba and taebo session. Also a place to practice tai chi.
Burnham Park,This place is a very popular tourist destination. So expect for this place to be crowdy but it is still a good park for a walk
Burnham Park,"Traffic, parking, crowd, street vendors, illegal massage concessions, hawkers. Weather is nice!"
Burnham Park,Nice place
Burnham Park,Burnham is more beautiful than before. The heart of baguio's tourism is now open to all and a lot of local and tourist is enjoying its breathtaking ambiance.
Burnham Park,Nice Experience but not that fun
Burnham Park,Stay in Baguio will never be complete without visiting Burnham Park.
Burnham Park,"Place has improved since my last visit about 4-5 years ago. It's a nice place to walk around and really explore the park. You can go rowing/pedalling on the boats on the lake/lagoon, go bicycling, rollerblading, or just plain walk around and see the rose garden or the orchidarium. There's also a playground at one end."
Burnham Park,"Wonderful park for family and everybody. Activities includes boating with different designs, biking both for adults and kids, children's park with lots of rides, swings and a lot more. Street foods also available.nearby restaurants for dining. It's at the heart of the city just accessible to a lot of convenience. There's a lot of parking space.but by the way, walking and sight seeing is Good, but rides are not free including comfort rooms except children's park which is all free."
Burnham Park,Great places..
Burnham Park,Went here during the day and night. Only few people were around at night so it is nice to hang around here as you wait for the night market to open. There are bike rentals in the evening too and less people so it is a better ride experience. Noon until afternoon is very busy and people filled but relatively okay since there are a lot of benches and shades.
Burnham Park,good for strolling. It was fun watching people zumba-ING??? lol😂😂
Burnham Park,a lot of space for open air chillin. has food and coffee stalls that are super good. they offer pay to use restrooms. very clean.
Burnham Park,Night Market at Burham Park   
Mines View Observation Deck,"I went on a weekend and it was overcrowded!!! Barely any space to move! Overcrowded just to see the views. You can buy souvenirs and food there. I got the 🌽 and it was yummy. The bathroom was clean though when I went. The ticket fee isn't pricey at all, but no parking unless you go early."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great place to visit. Don't forget it to your itinerary. However, sometimes it's too crowded that it's hard to get decent photos of yours because there are a lot of people especially during weekends. Luckily I was able to get these photos. Love the scenery."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Come to Mines View Observation Deck to breathe and relax away from work!My friends and I went here very early to watch the sunrise. I managed to get few snaps of the place as it was jam packed with tourists from other parts of the Philippines. On a hindsight, it is always like this whenever I come to Baguio. This place never run out of tourists. And one do understand why... Had I happen to live near here, I'd also frequent this site.We no longer took pictures with the horses nor with igorot costumes on and whatever there are. We just wandered the Mines View Park to appreciate what's in there and buy food and clothing to bring home as souvenir to our love ones.We had our breakfast just outside the Park where a canteen offers inexpensive but satisfying food nonetheless while waiting for the Good Shepherd Convent to open because we'd buy their products like the famous ube jam.In the years to come and given the chance to come again to Baguio, I would still come to Mines View Park and do what I did.Visit the Park if you can! It's worth your time and energy."
Mines View Observation Deck,As usual. You’ve got a nice view here if the weather permits you because sometimes the fog eats the view. Never the less it’s so relaxing and there are stalls where you can buy your pasalubongs as well. You just have to pay a small amount for you to enter the place but it’s worth it.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Gives a nice view of the mountains. Can get too crowded though, since tourists are not limited even in this time of the pandemic. Nice place to buy plants or get a quick bite too."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Observation Deck is indeed a breathtaking view. Despite the sun shining bright, it was only warm and not very hot.☺️☺️👏The parking area here is limited but the locals guide you to places where one can park. We parked right infront of a gated place to which they reassured us that it will be fine. It was not a paid parking but we provided tip.😊There are also a lot of places to buy pasalubong around here. You may check out as you walk to outside.👏👏............."
Mines View Observation Deck,There are many other good places you can visit on the ways most stunning views will see on road side if you are going by your own vehicle. This just a small place where from you can see one mountain that's all I didn't find anything interesting there. If you are going to botenical garden then Mines View is 3km from there
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great view of the mountain range. Unfortunately some are covered by houses, unlike before when Baguio was not that crowded. Lots of souvenirs to buy. They even sell a variety of plants in the area."
Mines View Observation Deck,Who would want to miss the Mines View Deck in Baguio City? I think most tourists visiting Baguio would not miss out this spot on their itinerary. You also get to taste the local delicacies & Filipino street foods here.
Mines View Observation Deck,The view was stunning. People liked lining up for picture taking dressed like the one on my image and they are enjoying how beautiful the nature is. The warm sun didn’t bother us because we feel the warmth as a relief from the city life we had.Baguio has a place in our heart and we will be back again.
Mines View Observation Deck,Great view and less crowded during pandemic.I recommend visiting during afternoon for picturesque sunset or morning for a more relaxing view of the mountains.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Overlooking view with a cold weather. If you want to buy souvenirs, t-shirts and pasalubog, this is the best place to go to as well as to have photos with colorful horses. Make sure to include it on your itinerary."
Mines View Observation Deck,The view on a clear sunny day was absolutely stunning. It's so crazy how the mountains of Benguet look like that for miles and miles. The deck itself wasn't big but just enough for everyone to see the view and have their photos. The visitors area where the shops were offered many pasalubong options
Mines View Observation Deck,"It is a great place to visit with family amazing  view with fog and lots of shops to buy goodies for pasalubong. But sometimes you have to move a bit far away from the entrance if you wanna buy some stuff, as the shops located in front of the entrance are a bit pricey compared to the  right or left side shops."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Observation Deck is indeed a breathtaking view.

We parked right infront of a gated place to which they reassured us that it will be fine. It was not a paid parking but we provided tip.There are also a lot of places to buy pasalubong around here. You may check out as you walk to outside."
Mines View Observation Deck,"It's not like it used to be said by my sister. But the scenery is still breathtaking. Baguio really did get great guns.It's my first time here in Baguio. And I'm gonna make the best out of it.P.S a little thrifty advice from me to you. Try not to buy everything (i mean pasalubong) in just one place. If you're planning to visit places in Baguio, try buying memorabilia or pasalubong from each place you're gonna visit. For you to have various options and memorabilia from places to places."
Mines View Observation Deck,Pretty overrated in my opinion. Yes the view is gorgeous but it’s literally one lookout point and it’s ridiculously crowded on the weekends. Not super worth the trip up and honestly feel there are better views in other parts of Baguio.
Mines View Observation Deck,"A majestic place with beautiful scenery. However, you do need to pay attention to the fog. There will be moments that there will be so much that there will be nothing to see. If it seems a little foggy in the city reschedule your trip if the view is more important than the wonderful side attractions and authentic food.Love to witness an amazing sunrise behind the meadows, in the cold foggy morning, head to mines view park, and reach to the observations point. it is really interesting place to visit with family. there are Plenty of craft stalls and souvenirs. so that you can collect the things what you want. Costumes to try on for a small fee representing local culture, horses to sit on for photographs. A place that's got real attraction. The marvelous viewing gallery over the valley. I would recommend that you make this a stop off point if you are near Baguio."
Mines View Observation Deck,"The view is magnificent where you can see the horizons of Baguio and Alphaland country Club is visible from Mines View.Compare to my last visit before pandemic, they already have an entrance fee of Php10.00. Several renovations has been done and the comfort rooms was improved. There are more Tiangge’s where you can buy Pasalubongs and Souvenirs.HorseBack photo ops starts at Php50.00Traditional Clothing photo ops starts at Php100.00A picture with the St. Bernard dog is Php100.00You will still get the same classic feeling of Mines View Park!Follow me for more review critics!"
Mines View Observation Deck,This is a famous tourist spot so there are tons of people. A lot of souvenir and plant shops inside too. You can also rent costumes inside for only 30 pesos and take pictures with the big fluffy dog and pink horses for 100 pesos. The view in the observation deck is breathtaking.Entrance fee: 10 for adults and 5 for kids
Mines View Observation Deck,"Very busy place with lots of visitors. Entrance fee is just 10php per head. Aside from the view, there are also horses and dogs which you can take picture with. Pasalubong stores are found inside and outside Mines View. Plus there are bulalohan restos around the place."
Mines View Observation Deck,Always a nice place to get a view of Baguio. My friend told me to go here on sunrise but I wasn't able to. Nice place to buy plants and souvenir as well. The sellers that we talked to were all nice.
Mines View Observation Deck,Great place to explore with 10 pesos entrance fee. You can also see plant shops inside and astonishing view.
Mines View Observation Deck,"The entrance fee is only P10/adult and less if you're a PWD/Senior/Child.  Please follow social distancing protocols (yes - wear that face mask)You can actually bring someone like your elderly mother on a wheelchair down the wheelchair ramp that goes all the way down - and the security guard/staff will gladly assist you to bring them down and up the winding wheelchair-accessible path.  Please give the friendly security guard a tip too for the free help.They've got it all inside the park - the pink ponies with P50 for solo shots or P100 for a group shot (guide tells you to do a 'wacky' pose), the Igorot costume-for-hire, the St Bernard dogs too.And it's great to buy succulents and other plants on sale - heck, even the strawberries too (if you know the prices of strawberries being P350/kg - you can always ask the seller to top-off her box on sale).  Plus other food items and souvenirs on sale.It's cheesy, it's corny, it can be loud and I wouldn't go here if it was too crowded.  But if you're an old Baguio regular - you gotta check out the much-improved park that is Mines View Park.  Before you know it - they'll be doing the Mines View glass walkway similar to what's been done in China, the Grand Canyon, etc."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Park is an overlook park on the northeastern outskirts of Baguio in the Philippines. It is five kilometers away from the Heart of Baguio, passing through the Botanical Garden, the Mansion House, Wright Park, and the Pacdal Circle. Entrance fee is ten pesos."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Wide, open area. Bikes, boating, jogging, any and all park things, you can do here. Walking distance from a lot of great places around the city and... Night market!!!"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mind blowing views. Pink horses. Rediculous ""covid precautions"". Being charged ""cano"" prices on things vs what locals paid. What's not to love? A seemingly random golden gate bridge in the botanical gardens. Random wooden carved keychains."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Kind of disappointed when we got there. Was hoping to see a beautiful and majestic landscape but was just a normal mountain view. I've seen more beautiful landscape on the way up and not on the main road, and the place was packed! Love the stores though. Honestly I think this place was overrated IMO.We took an alternative road through Asin. Super windy, uphill,  crazy hairpin turns and off-camber banking! (Love it!)."
Mines View Observation Deck,"We were here during the weekend. So I wanted to come very early to avoid the crowds. As early as 6:30am, there are people already there. They were kind enough to avoid being in your picture, which is great. I highly suggest that you go early or else it will be harder to avoid having photo bombers."
Mines View Observation Deck,The view was lovely! Less tourist on weekdays. There are a lot of selling pasalubong in this area. Pwede kang tumawad ng price. We decided to buy pasalubong here in Mines View cause its a long queue in Good Shepherd. Nice place to visit.
Mines View Observation Deck,It was fun...there's a lot of different type of plants that they sell inside and pasalubong giftsThe view was ashtonishing and you'll never get bored by just seeing the view
Mines View Observation Deck,"Visit Mines View Park to get a glimpse of Baguio's former mining town in the past, exploring the park is one of the must do in Baguio, The main attraction is a view deck that offers a stunning view of the Cordillera Mountains and the Benguet's Old Copper and Gold Mines, you can also rent traditional Ifugao garbs like bahag/loincloth/, headdress, Vest and also hold a Spear and Shield for picture taking, unfortunately i didn't rent one during my visit so I can't provide a photo of it, you can get Baguio's strawberry Taho at the park, you won't have trouble finding a vendor cause they are all over the place, you will also find rows of succulents, flowers and bonsai trees you can purchase."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Enjoyable! We went on a Sunday, pretty busy visit. My nephews enjoyed the typical activities - photo with the dogs and horses in costume 😊"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great view. We really enjoyed it here. As others mentioned,  the pink horses are an interesting addition."
Mines View Observation Deck,I expected something like a park similar to Botanical but it only gave a view deck with so many people congregating.
Mines View Observation Deck,For an entrance fee of 10pesos you will get to see the breathtaking view of the mountains. Also access to mines view park's souvenier shops.
Mines View Observation Deck,"So fun! Love the view  and outfits you can rent. Just one thing, the food inside the park is way too expensive."
Mines View Observation Deck,It's a nice place to get some fresh air. You only need 10 pesos for the entrance fee and you're good to go. There are some souvenir shops along the road where you can grab some.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Imbibe the Igorot culture within, through their costumes. Have your wonderful portrait taken inside the park, whether riding on a horse or on foot alone or among other guests, tourists and locals. Just make sure to uphold Safety and Health   Protocols."
Mines View Observation Deck,"You can get there by riding a jeepney from the town proper. There was a 10 pesos fee at the entrance. The view was great, but there were a lot of people taking pictures so prepare to butt in to take selfies with the view. You can also buy cooked corn, pusit, other souvenirs, taho among others."
Mines View Observation Deck,It now becomes a flea market before reaching the old and rundown shed. I wonder where the money goes for the collected entrance fee and stall rentals.
Mines View Observation Deck,Fun and pretty. Great nursery along the way. Lots of souvenir shopping in the immediate area as well.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Observation Deck has transformed into a tourist trap. Its main attraction - the viewing deck, is often left with litter by visitors, and is a shame. The overlooking mines view from the deck has degraded over the years due to poor urban planning of the area.If it's your first time traveling into Baguio, it's still worth visiting once, but should be prioritized the least. I suggest visiting nearby tourist spots near the area and Good Shepherd Convent for ""pasalubong"" before going here."
Mines View Observation Deck,"The rains did not even affect the majestic foliage of the view. I understand the in flux of people bcoz it has been days of rain and people who came to Baguio for the long weekend are dying to see the picturesque city. But the rains didn't allow people to do that, it was too cold. Visiting Mines View was a breath of fresh air after being cooped up in our hotel for days. Yes it was crowded, but who cares! It is Baguio. People go there in throngs! If you don't like the crowd then don't visit. But Baguio is Baguio. Take it or leave it. The people there are friendly, pasalubong was not too pricey considering the pandemic. I love the food stalls onsite. Great to be back Baguio! 😍😍"
Mines View Observation Deck,5 for The view  was spectacular great place to visit.2 star outside of the park need to pay attention with it comes to maintaining the place.theres a lot of sinages  around the park.looks like a market.!!!
Mines View Observation Deck,"aside from great view, it also has lots of pasalubong shops, you can opt to just buy here than to get bump to bump with people at public market. the prices were actually lower here. Also walking distance to good shepherd, and jeepney terminal going back to baguio plaza."
Mines View Observation Deck,Very nice place to visit in Baguio. The panoramic view is excellent. 15 to 20mins away from Sm Baguio.
Mines View Observation Deck,When in Baguio:One of the must visit tourists spots in Baguio. Wide selection of plants for sale. Good place for plant lovers.
Mines View Observation Deck,"apart from the very nice place, we really enjoy wearing igorot costume here, it's just a great traditional classic haha !"
Mines View Observation Deck,Great view and you can dress up as well. Shops around have good souvenirs as well!
Mines View Observation Deck,"A nice touristic place. However they collect entrance fee now,10 pesos for adults and 5 pesos for children."
Mines View Observation Deck,Too crowded and commercialized.. Didn't enjoy the view. More stressful tue enjoyable.
Mines View Observation Deck,I really love the view. Also Logan is the friendliest of all the dogs we met in Baguio.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Still one of the most visited places in Baguio, though it's now too commercialized due to several souvenir shops and food stalls."
Mines View Observation Deck,Just fine. One thing that caught my attention were the plants on sale. Place was too crowdy when we visited. I love the one's in Tagaytay though.
Mines View Observation Deck,People around the mines view park are approachable. If you have queries they are very approachable.
Mines View Observation Deck,Nothing special just like the same stuff like before hence there are lots of souvenirs and cheap stuffs to buy you just have to bargain and look for better offers
Mines View Observation Deck,"One of the most well-known and most visited attractions in Baguio City. Not just an overlooking view of the Northeast side, they also have shops for souvenirs, snacks and other pasalubong for your family."
Mines View Observation Deck,I've been here a couple of times now but the breathtaking view just gets me everytime. This is where i get my pasalubongs everytime!
Mines View Observation Deck,"I love the place. Great scenery at the view deck. You'll have the chance also to have photo op with a St. Bernard dog, and a pink horse for a reasonable amount. I also enjoyed the grilled squid and the souvenir section in the vicinity."
Mines View Observation Deck,You can buy many sorts of flowers here. And Also take pictures with a horse and a Saint Bernard 🐕
Mines View Observation Deck,"Bad day to visit for us we didn't see anything it's very foggy. It's nice to see the dog and the horses can't see the views at all and it's raining very heavy, I'm sure it's a beautiful place to visit if the the weather is nice."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Bit of a climb since the area is closed for cars near the entrance of Good shepherd convent. Features souvenir shops, plants, punk rock horses, and of course the view. We couldn't see much due to the fog and rain but it was still a fun walk. Bought a few pasalubong along the way. I imagine it gets crowded easily during peak season so place your visit wisely."
Mines View Observation Deck,Quite busy on weekends and on holidays but you can try visit mid week where there are not much tourists walking around. Get your photos taken with the horses and big dogs. You could also get your pasalubong around the area. Perfect place to be as last place to visit on your Baguio itinerary.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Good view. Except for that pricey St. Bernard group shot and Horseback shot in indian headdress, this is a cheap tourist spot in Baguio"
Mines View Observation Deck,They are open as early as 6am but the vendor of plants and flowers are open around 7:30am or 8:00am
Mines View Observation Deck,"Its raining when we visit here but a really good visit as well you can see the mountain view very nice and have some fog on it theres a lot of activities in the area as well like picture taking with the horses , with the saint bernard dog, buying of souvenirs, buying bonsai plants theres a lot of good things you can see here"
Mines View Observation Deck,"It was really nice to be here again. I was here 2015 and still lots of people visiting. You have to pay for the entrance that before it was free. You can rent a Igorot clothing you can take photos as much as you want, still have couple horses to have a picture with the nice view. Lots of plants to buy and also souvenirs."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Same old, same old. But it never stops to enchant visitors. Also a good area to get your souvenirs of the city."
Mines View Observation Deck,Great View but dangerous place to take pictures due to the jagged slippery rocks.
Mines View Observation Deck,Mines View a must go see place in Baguio the view is amazing and quite relaxing. Enjoy the Philippine heritage
Mines View Observation Deck,"You now have to pay to be able to enter the view deck.  All you can see now are mostly houses.The restrooms need to improve.  You have to pay a certain amount to be able to use the restroom but you have to squat on the ground.  It's not suitable for Senior Citizens because I think it would be hard for them to sit and stand up using the squat latrine (Female Restroom)The souvenir shops on the other side of the road offer a lot of things like wood carvings, jackets, t-shirts, ref magnets, food items, etc.  You can haggle for price discounts.Parking is a struggle."
Mines View Observation Deck,"The best thing you can do at this place and take a good picture, and buy some souvenirs"
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice place to view mountainscape. But there were people most of the time so catching a photo of yourself or with other friends may be a little challenging. Better have some good editing skills.
Mines View Observation Deck,"The mountain's view is mesmerizing. If you are a fan of nature, you will love it!"
Mines View Observation Deck,So so nice I love the surrounding proud to be Pinoy
Mines View Observation Deck,If you are a plant lover come and visit the Mines View. It is also a perfect place to empty your mind. 😊
Mines View Observation Deck,"Beautiful and clean place. The view is breath-taking. Rest room, souvenir shops, ifugao traditional clothes rental, and many more activities to do."
Mines View Observation Deck,"The construction site in the entrance is very dismaying, the viewdeck is very crowded and the queue is very long"
Mines View Observation Deck,Visited on 09/29/2022. It was a weekday when we came so the viewing deck was not as crowded. We were able to find a spot in no time to take pictures under clear skies/no fog and sans photobombers.
Mines View Observation Deck,"A little crowded for Friday afternoon. Igorot people are very nice. We rented their traditional suits and the Lolo & Lola was very gentle they even take photos for me and my brother, they were very patient. Little TIPS will help them so please be KIND. ❤️🙏🏽 Visitors please be respectful to others this is public place, a little kindness to others will have a great impact. No cutting off the lines and don’t be rude. Lots of tourist 🤭"
Mines View Observation Deck,"the view is nice but can get very crowded. also, there are horses with pink dyed hair 😕"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Since we went during the holidays, place was overcrowded, parking was a problem and view wasn't really that breathtaking. On the other hand, weather was really nice for me. It was around 14 degrees at that time. While it may be chilly for some, I took the opportunity to enjoy it since you can't have that in Manila."
Mines View Observation Deck,good place to take a picture and buy souvenirs
Mines View Observation Deck,You can rent telescope for 20 pesos 10 minutes 💖
Mines View Observation Deck,"Crowded and the ""the view"" is nothing special. The horses seem too tired, hope they are taken care of."
Mines View Observation Deck,One of the best place to visit in Baguio! Love the view of cordillera mountains.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - View📸📸📸📸📸 - Instagrammable😊😊😊😊😊 - Enjoyable👍👍👍👍👍 - Family & Friend's Bonding❌ - Comfort Room✔️ - Parking Area
Mines View Observation Deck,"Baguio is still one of the nicest place to visit. Aside from the cold weather, you still get to explore nature and the locals.  So many places to tour around.  It is worth the stay."
Mines View Observation Deck,Amazing experience must visit when you are in Baguio
Mines View Observation Deck,"Amazing view from the observation area, was very crowded when we went but thankfully I was one of tallest people there so I could see over the crowd. Definitely visit when in Baguio."
Mines View Observation Deck,best place to go to see sun rise
Mines View Observation Deck,"What makes the Mines View Park a popular destination is the scenic and overlooking view of the Amburayan Valley and the abandoned mines of Itogon. There are a lot of shops in the area. However, this place is way overrated. I do not recommend taking photos with the horses and the St. Bernard dogs. They look so tired, especially with the redness of their eyes."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Been here many times, and it's always different experience."
Mines View Observation Deck,The place is even more exciting than the last time I went a few years ago... They improved the place and all the stores for you to buy souvenirs😊❤️
Mines View Observation Deck,A bit small and crowded when we went. Construction on going. Costumes for rent for pictures
Mines View Observation Deck,"Date of visit 2019 Dec 24.Time of visit 10.45 am to 12.30 pm.Sight Seeing 9.Ambience 9.Price Free.Expected exploration time 1 to 2 hours.Sight Seeing: There is a small observation deck overlooking the surrounding mountains and valley. The scenic spot is very beautiful and must not be missed although it is extremely crowded on the deck. There are also photo booths, and sheltered areas where you can shop for souvenirs in the Mines View Park.Ambience: The air is fresh and clean. The view is stunning and breathtaking."
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice view which i can get from Rizal Province.Too many people. Love the horse pic and dress up IP though.
Mines View Observation Deck,Beautiful place 😍 nice view 👌
Mines View Observation Deck,"if you are in Baguio, and love to witness an amazing sunrise behind the meadows, in the cold foggy morning, head to mines view park, and reach to the observations point. it is really interesting place to visit with family. there are Plenty of craft stalls and souvenirs. so that you can collect the things what you want. Costumes to try on for a small fee representing local culture, horses to sit on  for photographs. A place that's got real attraction. The marvelous viewing gallery over the valley. I would recommend that  you make this a stop off point if you are near Baguio."
Mines View Observation Deck,Too crowded and there are a lot of areas baguio can offer.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Such a magnificent view! We got to enjoy the overlooking deck, wearing the Igorot costume and riding a horse. Also a perfect place to shop for Pasalubong."
Mines View Observation Deck,Not the same as before as there are more houses on the mountain across the viewdeck. Lots of technicolor ponies for photographs too. Grilled corn still good.
Mines View Observation Deck,"I alway sneak here at night when I am so stressed. When everything's populating my mind, I always find myself hanging out here. It's a great place to stargaze, watch the moon, and just let the night pass."
Mines View Observation Deck,"A majestic place with beautiful scenery. However, you do need to pay attention to the fog. There will be moments that there will be so much that there will be nothing to see. If it seems a little foggy in the city reschedule your trip if the view is more important than the wonderful side attractions and authentic food."
Mines View Observation Deck,"It wasn't too crowded back when we were kids and the view was really nice since it was all nature, unlike today where there are now a bunch of houses below the view point. These days it's your typical tourist trap. I mean if you haven't been here before, you at least have to go once. But, you can't really avoid it too since it's near Good Shepherd and that's the best place to get goodies. There are a bunch of places to get souvenirs, trinkets and food stuffs, but if you want to save a few pesos, might as well do your shopping in the City Market. The views are still nice, you can just sit down and chill with all the tourists milling around you in the view point. Expect to get stuck in traffic and most times taxis won't even agree to bring you there."
Mines View Observation Deck,"It's a tourist-y place and a tourist trap, but the views are splendid. Come very early to catch some breathtaking sunrise!"
Mines View Observation Deck,Too crowded on weekends. The view is now lrss appreciated since alot of houses and buildings are in sight instead of the green mountains. I think they should open at night tho and expand the viewing deck since people are crowded in a small area
Mines View Observation Deck,"Even though Baguio only limits their tourist during this pandemic, we were lucky to have a chance to visit this place. I really like this kind of clean and peaceful scenery whenever I visit some tourist attractions. I hope we can visit this place again😊"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Lovely views from this observation deck if the weather is good, although there are a lot of steps to climb up and down in order to get there, so it would be difficult for those who find it hard to climb. It was very empty due to the pandemic which made it a better experience, but there are a lot of vendors there for tourists are also some horses (sadly with their manes dyed bright pink) waiting for photo opportunities."
Mines View Observation Deck,"I have no idea what time you should go but better go when there is no fog. You will love the scenery. 50 pesos per 3 shots on the horses, but there is an option if you wish to take pictures with the St. BERNARD dog or grab an igorot costume and get a snap of yourself. For me it is the viewing deck which amazes me with the view."
Mines View Observation Deck,place is nice and beautiful ... i just hope that people will try to take care of it a d make sure its always clean and pretty. people and staff are nice and its enjoyable. prices are within range.
Mines View Observation Deck,"The views of the Cordilleras are magnificent.But I think the sole viewing deck is just too small to fit lots of people taking selfies. The place should be remodeled with winding trails and, yes, more viewing decks.The photo ops with the pink horses (I think they are supposed to resemble unicorns) and those huge St. Bernards dogs are great for the kids.Question, what is the connection with the local Igorot tribes or Baguio?Besides those gripes, I love coming here whenever I am around Baguio for a relaxing vacation 😊✌🏼"
Mines View Observation Deck,"A really interesting place to visit for the  whole family. Plenty of craft stalls and souvenirs.Costumes to try on for a small fee representing local culture, horses to sit on  for photographs. A place that's got real attraction.  A marvellous viewing gallery over the valley. I would recommend that  you make this a stop off point if you are near Baguio."
Mines View Observation Deck,One of the most visited tourist spot in Baguio and this is the third time that I have visited this place. There's better walkways as well compared to the last time I visited. I would really recommend though that you go here very early in the morning for 2 reasons:1. The sunrise is breathtaking.2. There will be less people meaning less photo bombers.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Crowded. Always crowded. The prices of souvenirs here are expensive than in Botanical garden or down in the city. There's plenty of plants though which is good to see or chose from if you like to buy. The restroom is paid one, so you need to pay but there's no tissue, not so clean as well. The deck was always full but the view was great."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Absolutely fantastic views, I can imagine it would be busy at weekends or peak holiday season but it would still be worth a visit.You could also take a pleasant stroll down to Wright Park and the Mansion.Highly recommended 👍👍"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Went here on a weekend and it was crowdedddd! You cant think properly because you can barely get a good pose. Hahaha In all, it really is good place but the influx of tourists is crazy! Go there early to avoid crowd and traffic."
Mines View Observation Deck,"The views are breathtaking especially of the Mineviews, the observation deck has one platform only, gets rather crowded, so wait your turn.This is located on a land promontory 4 km from downtown Baguio, the park overlooks the mining town of Itogon, particularly the abandoned gold and copper mines of the Benguet Corporation, and offers a glimpse of the Amburayan Valley."
Mines View Observation Deck,Free entrance. Good view. Theres so many pasalubong finds in the area.
Mines View Observation Deck,"With your 10php, you will get to see the result of mining. Pretty devastating view. Feel free to try this inihaw na pusit that is being sold along mine's view for 30 php!"
Mines View Observation Deck,"A must visit place here in Baguio, Philippines. Nice cold weather, very relaxing ambience,"
Mines View Observation Deck,"I still remember the last time I visited Mines View and it felt breathtaking. Try to go here early morning rather than later in the afternoon. When I breathe the air, it has that mentol-like smell that runs through your nostrils and throat. There won't be a crowd early in the morning, as I have experienced, and you can take photos as many as you want although the lighting can be a bit troublesome as there won't be enough sunlight but it depends on what time you are there."
Mines View Observation Deck,Perfect place this summer. Tourism is back so plenty of people in the area and the souvenir and pasalubong shops are also open.
Mines View Observation Deck,A good place for a family to buy pasalubong. Go early tho as the parking can easily be full especially during the weekend.
Mines View Observation Deck,They are now able to regulate the number of tourists visiting.Parking is still a bit of a challenge.You would have to park somewhere between mines view hotel.
Mines View Observation Deck,"A little bit too crowded, they dont provide enough trash bins. Plenty of plastics in the place, unpleasant to the eyes."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Heavy rain so we don’t much enjoy the view’s but still amazing, 👌🏼👌🏼"
Mines View Observation Deck,Viewing deck now too small to accommodate too many tourists. Too many souvenir shops too that's blocking the view. Too touristy. I love the plants for sale though. Not only are they cheap but they are a nice decoration on the pathway to the mines view. The mountains are now greener than it used to be.
Mines View Observation Deck,"That time was raining, and lots visitors, hard to take photos. But still, we enjoyed. You have to pay for the comfort rooms.Rental of ifugao costume is P25 only.You can buy the plants for P50 -100, depending on the class and size  just like fot the cactus"
Mines View Observation Deck,Lots of people in the area. People are wearing face mask and there is an entrance fee of 10 pesos per head for adult.
Mines View Observation Deck,Calming and relaxing view. Good place to take a breath and watch sunrise.
Mines View Observation Deck,"The view in the deck is extraordinary. Entrance Fee: Adult 10, Children 5"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Still a better viewLocation : Mines view Baguio CitySpecialty: tourist destinationRate : ⭐️⭐️⭐️Food : ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️A lot of food vendors all over the place with freshly cut mangoes, corns, strawberry, chains of restaurants along side with so much grilled BBQ you just have to choose and try.Ambiance : ⭐️⭐️⭐️Great weather, great view but very crowded as alwaysValue for money: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️It’s free for the view deck, terms of food and Souvenirs it’s affordableLocation:⭐️⭐️⭐️Local taxi are very well on this destination, for tourist, it’s a bit tricky ( for us) can be reached by taxi, private car, public transportation called Jeepney (station is nearby burnham park)Service :There’s people maintaining the placeTips:Try to bargain on souvenirs they might just give you discounts 😅"
Mines View Observation Deck,"The place is great but be wary of those people asking you for photo ops with dogs. They offer 3 shots for P50. Be mindful especially when you already have 3 shots since they would still continue to take more shots without you knowing since they will somehow distract you. On the other hand, you can buy a lot of stuff inside the place for your families and friends. I would still recommend this place aside from having the chance to taste their strawberry taho for P30."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Jampacked.People crowd on the lone promontory stand where one can have his/her selfie against the mines' view and the still breathtaking Cordillera range below.We just had our souvenir  shots in the entrance studios for mementos,and departed quickly,for our health."
Mines View Observation Deck,So many people and so many business enterprises inside. Maybe good for the economy but the original beauty of area could hardly be seen. High risk for covid transmission 😢 Mines View Park is a must seen in Baguio
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice view and has plenty of snack & pasalubong options
Mines View Observation Deck,This is one of the famous tourist spots in Baguio where you can have a wonderful view of Benguet Mountains.  Souvenir shops and fast food restaurants are also available here.
Mines View Observation Deck,You can see and feel nature. Take pictures with the famous St. Bernard dog and horse; experience wearing Ifugao native costume. There are stores which offer Baguio products too.
Mines View Observation Deck,It was a long time since I last visited Baguio City. It was like 7 or 8 years ago. Coming back here with my girlfriend is such a memorable experience. The view and cool climate is awesome.
Mines View Observation Deck,"This is one wonderful fiesta for your eyes . Watch the majesty of the mountains as long as you want, still you never get tired. Feel the thrilling beauty of greenery, yet you cannot be bored. Listen to the whispers of wind, who carries the secrets of thw valleys below, yet never get disappointed . This place is beautiful and at the same time thrilling, majestic and beautiful, exuberant and simple."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Park is a must have in any tourist's itinerary visiting Baguio. Aside from it being easily accessible by vehicles, it has also lots of stores for souvenirs with affordable prices. You could also haggle with shop owners if you buy by bulk.It has also lots of shops selling potted plants and of course the costume shop that rents indigenous clothing. Though be careful going to the observatory since it becomes slippery when wet."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Baguio is not a city of pines anymore, but of houses with no order. Feel frustrated seeing Baguio though the weather is still good."
Mines View Observation Deck,The view is nice but it's overcrowded. The traffic leading up is awful because of the numbers of people. The shops are overpriced tourist traps selling the same generic stuff.I recommend going to a nice resto with similar views.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Though this observation deck is rarely cleared off with people, it is a great view. You have to take turns in taking photos thus, I advise that you go to this place at an earlier time durinh weekdays."
Mines View Observation Deck,The place is too crowded. You will not be able to enjoy the view.
Mines View Observation Deck,You must not miss this while in Baguio. The famous Mines View Observatory truly never fails to capture tourists by its magnificent view. Of course during peak season there are so many tourists but nonetheless a must visit!
Mines View Observation Deck,"It has a beautiful view. However, my recent visit was not great. It was jam-packed by tourists even though it's already July. The prices of their well-known products almost doubled up."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Park is one of the most visited place in Baguio that's why it can be traffic on the way up there, and the inside of the park can be crowded. There are lots of things to do in the park. There are some photo-ops with a fee (with a St. Bernard dog, in a horse with a head dress or wearing indigenous clothing). Plant vendors are mostly in the middle of the park. At the side, lots of vendors are selling souvenirs, food pasalubongs and street foods. Note that seats are very few in this park.The observation deck offers a great view of Baguio. Not really accessible by PWDs since going to the observation deck requires to go down and up narrow stairs. There are very few seats in the viewing deck, and some rock formations which you can also sit on. In the viewing deck area, binoculars are for rent for those who want better sight-seeing experience."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Better than the deck of the 80's and 90's but somehow this new version has that ""commercial"" feel."
Mines View Observation Deck,"A place I will ALWAYS want to come back to even though I live in the neighboring area. This is where I often go whenever I want to be reminded of Baguio City's fresh and cool breeze. Early morning will be the best time to go like before 7am.I salute the Barangay's continuous work in doing their best to improve cleanliness and more order to the area. It definitely looks better now.I am a Baguio local and we, residents in the area suggest visitors to use public transports in coming up to the city of pines as this will help lessen traffic jams and at the same time will also help make our local drivers happy as they will be busy during your visits."
Mines View Observation Deck,"It was rainy and foggy when we went to Mines View so we didnt quite have a good view of Baguio from here. There are plants being sold as well but we already bought from the strawberry farm so i didnt bother to check on it anymore. After  my son had photos taken with the adorable horse, we already left and went back to the hotel, 10 mins walk away."
Mines View Observation Deck,Due to pandemic there are only few tourist that go to this spot. P50 pesos entrance fee.
Mines View Observation Deck,One of the most popular to-go to places in Baguio. But other than seeing mountains and greeneries in bird's eye view there nothing much to do here. You can however buy small plants and ride a bleached pony as a souvenir.
Mines View Observation Deck,Overrated and overcrowded. There are other places that offers the same view. You can’t even get a decent photo due to the crowd. No marshal around to call out people deliberately removing their masks and littering in the area
Mines View Observation Deck,"Always great, must visit when you go to Baguio."
Mines View Observation Deck,Too many people. Souvenir shopping is awesome though and the plants for sale are simply unique.The other downsides of this place are:1. Path leading to the view deck smells of horse dung.2. The view of the mines is now peppered with shanties.3. Some trees have been cut to make way for what looks like a new road being worked on by a bulldozer.The St. Bernard dog along the path looks kinda cute though so I can't really give this tourist spot a 1-star rating.
Mines View Observation Deck,"I've been here for a couple of times,  and I am not just comfortable seeing those big dogs being rudely handled by their owners for some tourist photo. The animals are not happy,  though this place is highly recommended. Souvenir shops are everywhere, and it's near to Good Shepherd. Parking is limited, and there's a lot of plants that you can also buy and take home.  Enjoy the view and the grill squid for 25 pesos the best!"
Mines View Observation Deck,"It's a great place and tge scenery is beautiful. The locals that is making their living there is friendly. The foods and the souvenir shops  are very well organize. Though there is a small problem that I found out. The trash that is leaved by the tourist are scattered in throught the place, trash bins are so limited ,you can just found one or two. The animals condition there is poor where the horses cannot sit down and just standing throuhgout the day. But it is just as beautiful place. Come and try guys. You won't regret!"
Mines View Observation Deck,"this is one of the common tourist spots in Baguio City. It is just a few meters away from the famous Mountain Maid Training Center, commonly known as  Good Shepherd - makers of the best ube jam in Baguio. Experience local chill and sunrise at the Mines View deck early in the morning to avoid crowds. You can also find souvenirs, silvershops, succulents and other flowers, and restaurants that serve native Baguio food in the area."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Always an important stop for those visiting the City of Pines! Aside from the magnificent views, one can indulge in 'pasalubong' shopping in the area - from handicrafts, to souvenirs to Baguio delicacies, one is surely spoilt for choice! Tip, during busy days, get the nearest available parking and jusy walk to the sites..."
Mines View Observation Deck,Very Nice View And A Must See when visiting Baguio.....  You can rent costumes for a fee (30 php/ head) Take A Picture on A Horse (50 php/ head) or simply Shop around and enjoy both the food as well and the scenic view .......
Mines View Observation Deck,Mines view but actualy overlooking house is what you are seeing. Here you can buy pasalubongs and what nuts.
Mines View Observation Deck,Uninteresting place where it's very crowded and commercialized. You must wait your turn to take a good view of whatever mountain range is there and wait even longer to take a pic of yourself.
Mines View Observation Deck,Cool weather that you really wanna drink rum or beer
Mines View Observation Deck,It is very relaxing to see the over looking view of Benguet Mountains. Although it will get crowded during the day but it's worth it. You can also buy a lot of souvenirs here with affordable price.
Mines View Observation Deck,"I understand that the Mines View Observation park is part of the culture and part of the must whenever you are in Baguio, we gave it a shot and we didn't like it. I like nature and the view is gorgeous, I love and enjoyed the view but the observation deck is too crowded, its really hard to even walk or observe in peace, it was sticky and hot the people are too hype. There are costumes being rented for a photo op which is fine, there are horses being abused for money, some horses looks really tired and about to fall asleep while people on costume riding them for a perfect photo snap, people should not support that kimd of business. There are a lot of vendors and stalls where you could buy souvenir items from strawberry wine to key chains and ref magnets. The advertised clean comfort room is a sham, a scam and lie. Its not clean, its crowded, its dirty and smelly, the entire place ia oozing with amonia and the floor is even sticky to walk and the worst thing about it is you have to pay which I assumed is for the maintenance. It has a lot of stair and could be tiring to walk if you are not physically fit, you will gasp for air. Its worth a visit if you dont mind the crowd and the stairs, anyway people come here for the views. There is also a wishing well that makes people throw coins, everyone know that is a complete scam but we enjoyed it."
Mines View Observation Deck,Also one of the attractions mostly visited by tourists. U can take a panoramic picture at the deck with the vast mountains in the background.
Mines View Observation Deck,Great scenery. But it's also here I realise I'm slightly afraid of heights. They sell flowers up here and the seeds. I bought some sunflower dwarf seeds. They have strawberry tauhu and picture taking for P20
Mines View Observation Deck,"Iconic because of movies that were shot here. Also iconic because of its gorgeous view. I love the costume rentals that cost only 20php. The pink horse is also cute. Don't go on a weekend or holiday, it's so crowded"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Nice View, lots of souvenir gifts, Cosplay and Transgendered individuals but there are many great views in Baguio.Baguio city is in the mountains, or the central park is surrounded by them and the mountain sides are covered in brightly painted houses right up to their peaks so it is a very attractive city to look at. This means that getting the 20 minute taxi or 30 minute Jeepney ride to Mines View Park where one can see some breathtaking hills dotted with a few houses, is a bit low on cost performance. However, I enjoyed the Jeepney ride for 17 peso from the main-street side of Burnham Park. One of our party enjoyed the cosplay that she participated in, wearing a first American headdress while riding a donkey, and the many souvenir shops sell the complete run of Baguio souvenir paraphernalia at (I have not checked prices elsewhere) inexpensive prices. For example 7 little pots of confectionery could be had for 100 peso. Many of the souvenir shop proprietors appeared to be male to female transgendered individuals. I thought that perhaps some use could have been made of this fact by perhaps their offering to dress male visitors as women in another cosplay variant, or just offering to pose with the brave. I hope they feel proud of who they are.There was also a vendor or two selling the sweet toufu from stainless steel drums. I think it is called aho. There is also an excellent all you can eat Korean restaurant called ""Korean Palace"" on the way between mines view and Baguio City centre.Mines view park is the place to go for Baguio souvenirs."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Park is a popular Baguio tourist attraction with stores selling refreshments, handicrafts, and botanical goods. Lower half of the park offers photo ops with authentic Igorot clothing, horses, and dogs.Mines View Park overlooks Itogon's abandoned mines, commonly known as Balatoc Mines.Mines View Park's observation platform is popular for taking shots of Baguio's surroundings. This park site has a shelter with chairs for shade and relaxation."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Amazing view deck of the mines :), you can rent igorot costume for 30 pesos..souvenir is available nearby :)"
Mines View Observation Deck,"The purpose and the view of ""mines"" is no longer visible plus the view is with many house structures already. However, maintained cleanliness and calmness is commendable."
Mines View Observation Deck,"The view deck needs a lot of improvement. Bits of trash scattered all around with overflowing trash bins. I wish some people in authority takes notice of these eyesores.   Structures are also dilapidated. I wonder why people still come here. Maybe because of the benguet products sold nearby. I didnt take photos, xayang ang film."
Mines View Observation Deck,"One of the places in Baguio that a tourist should visit. The view is still breathtaking even if you've been there a couple of times but you can't appreciate it peacefully because there are lots of tourists and not enough space for anyone to linger. It's a ""take a pic and go"" place kind of area. And they also have lots of cheap souvenir shops to choose from."
Mines View Observation Deck,Not much people this June 2021. Don't forget to support the locals by buying pasalubongs. Try not to haggle anymore since they're badly affected by the pandemic. Be kind and share your blessings 😊
Mines View Observation Deck,I like their costumes. They will dress you up for 25 pesos only. You can take pictures either with a horse a view of mountains . They have giant dogs there too if you are a dog lover you can take pictures with them. I think they charge it.  I took a selfie with their costumes. And it looks really good. :) . You should try it. You can see My sample pictures below.Ig: her.maine.56
Mines View Observation Deck,"An exciting place to go to, it was really worth it seeing the view and experiencing it first hand. It might just be an observation deck but for me it symbolizes a lot more of our culture and Baguio’s communities."
Mines View Observation Deck,"This is one og the great tourist spots in baguio with a big view over the valley. Picture taking on a pony horse, with st.bernhard dog or in original costumes can be done. A big variety of plants, souvenirs are available same as the famous baguio woodcarvings. Restaurants with philippino food and others are on this site wich makes it rili worth to visit."
Mines View Observation Deck,Beautiful place to stay in nature
Mines View Observation Deck,"I knew there would be so many tourists here which is why I did not include this in our itinerary for our Baguio Trip. But some of the people in our group insisted on doing the usual Mines View - Good Shepherd - The Mansion (and more) pilgrimage. The place is packed. Everyone wanted to wear Igorot costumes and take selfies. The place is dirty and hot and noisy.I bought 4 nice pots of plants, though."
Mines View Observation Deck,I find it not the same as it was 5 yrs ago. I didn't even went until the viewpoint because I find it TOo crowded. Good they asks 5-10 pesos entrance fee to improve the spot but I'm giving a less point for putting shops inside and allowing the picture taking with horses ( disguised as an Indian-American? ) and with that poor dog.
Mines View Observation Deck,Crowded place. observation deck is a only good for a certain number of visitors for good photo ops. Visit during weekdays to avoid the crowd. Pasalubong center.
Mines View Observation Deck,I definitely recommend this place to visit if you are in baguio. Although its been crowded when visit there still it has a nice view to offer. Before they have q bug dog but now 2018 all they have are horses
Mines View Observation Deck,"Far away from the city, this is a place that's not so easy to visit. However, being there would be such a thrill. The windmills are gigantic by the way."
Mines View Observation Deck,A good place to visit first. Make sure to buy your pasalubong here. It's near Good shepherd. Offers a wide range of items to buy.
Mines View Observation Deck,"In Mines View  you must try to ride horse, you can try to wear the Igorot costume with a minimal entrance of 10pesos or 20 I forgot, then the Igorot costume I think 30pesos, and the back ride horse 50? Something like that. We really enjoy with my colleagues, we went there to visit but its unplanned visit"
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice place its my first time
Mines View Observation Deck,This place never gets old. I always love seeing and going here. Plus the shops that surrounds it are better organized. It's a must when you're in Baguio
Mines View Observation Deck,"Nice view though a bit crowded. There are snacks you can buy, pasalabong too. Choices of plants that you can buy and take home too :)"
Mines View Observation Deck,"I will give 4 stars simply because mines view is not that beautiful like in the past years, that there were no houses at the bottom of mimes view."
Mines View Observation Deck,Beautiful view with lots of people as you'd always come to expect from anything beautiful and listed! If you want scenic and quiet probably come here very early!
Mines View Observation Deck,"Awesome place with beautiful view, plants and local food, you can try on the traditional clothes and taking special photos! very worthy to come."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Since Mines View is one of the top attraction in Baguio there are a lot of people who visits the place. I am a plant lover and was so happy to see various kinds of plants, cacti and succulents there. However, the prices are much expensive.Since I knew the regular prices of the plants, I did not buy them. I just tried to wear the traditional costume of the Igorots available in the site for only 20Php per person. The natives will dress you up and help you  wear the tapis, poncho and accessories properly. Kids can also wear these because they offer different sizes of tapis and vests.You can have a picture with the famous St. Bernard dog. 2shots for 50Php."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Pretty cool looking place. The deck is not that big.If it's your first time here in baguio, you must go here fist before anything else, although this place has a really great view, there are other places with much better view. So to not ruin the experience, you must GO HERE FIRST.You're not gonna regret it.And this place has a lot of vendors for take aways."
Mines View Observation Deck,The place is very relaxing. The view is more than as you expected! I suggest going there before sunrise so you can get a better view. 👌
Mines View Observation Deck,"The place is too crowded.We just went there and took pics. Didn't  appreciate the crowd, everything were too commercialized already."
Mines View Observation Deck,"One of the a must place to visit in Baguio,here you could rent an Igorot costume for a minimal fee and have a unlimited photo with it and at the same time help the senior citizens of Baguio,have a picture with a St. Bernard dog,and have picture riding a hirse wearing an Indian headrest,but I don’t see the mines."
Mines View Observation Deck,"If you're in Baguio don't miss this place,a lot of shops perfect for souvenirs...and a lot of things to do,food is good,and taking photos in awesome views❤️"
Mines View Observation Deck,There is something missing about this place...i just cant figure out what it is.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Tourist spot in Baguio city. Got a lot of souvinir, good view and a lot of contents for tourist like picture with  big shepherd dog, horse ride and ilocano costume. Must visit place. And it's near from Good shepherd!"
Mines View Observation Deck,Great place to look at the natural beauty of Baguio but won’t recommend coming on holidays or weekends as you can get stuck in traffic and not have space to see the view. It’s tourist-heavy so be prepared for that. Otherwise the souvenir shops are nice and cheap great for buying in bulk to take back home. The toilet costs 6php so make sure you keep some change when you visit.Make sure you try the strawberry taho (soy custard)  as well as they are a specialty in Baguio.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Under renovation infront, but stores were organized now..."
Mines View Observation Deck,It was good to see once again this place although this time we facing pandemic but there still alot of people there.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Nice view,added attraction are colorful horses. You can buy souvenirs here."
Mines View Observation Deck,It was a total void when we went there.. cannot see anything.. but the weather is so good there.. its so cool..
Mines View Observation Deck,"The 360 degrees viewdeck was just perpect , the only downside is you can not have your desired photo shot because the place was too crowded on that day..Aside from taking pictures, there""s nothing much too do.We don't pay much attention on picture taking  with the horse while on Igorot costume."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Definitely not in its pristine condition anymore (lots of houses already as part of the view).We visited the place on a Christmas day, which is a bad idea, due to heavy pedestration and vehicle traffic.  Mines view park became ""mans"" view park due to heavy congestion. Might as well go to Sheperd's Gallery to see the view better."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Yes, you can clearly see how high you are from this view deck, however when you look down, you can see houses below. I guess I was expecting more pine trees. The place is also beginning to have a serious garbage problem."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Its ok.. a must see in baguio. But the park is small, nothing much to see.. theres no entrance fee though and a lot of cheap finds including good and afforadable food and souvenir."
Mines View Observation Deck,It was a very nice place a few years ago as the stunning view of the scenery were not surrounded by houses that much. The place is also very busy however there are many shops that sells souvenirs and local plants.
Mines View Observation Deck,"It's the same old mines view park but now with entrance fee, the view is getting more riddled with houses each time we get to visit and it's slowly removing the essence of what it is famous for."
Mines View Observation Deck,Best place to buy pasalubong and souvenirs! You can bargain all you want. The view was awesome you can take pictures with horses here and they have plants all over different kinds and all. The taxi driver said best time to go here is at night the view are more breathe taking. They close at 7pm. And easy to transport from mines view to bayan which is 10 pesos only.
Mines View Observation Deck,"It was nice, it's just that the place were too crowded when I went there."
Mines View Observation Deck,Great views and lots of souvenir stands to get all baguio souvenirs sorted. A bit unorganized though and parking might be sparse and a walk is needed
Mines View Observation Deck,Worth a visit when you’re up in Baguio!Don’t miss the strawberry taho available outside the entrance. It’s what I miss the most!
Mines View Observation Deck,Sweeping views! Cheap traditional outfit rental - only 20 pesos. There are pink-dyed horses where you can ride for a photoshoot.
Mines View Observation Deck,View from observation deck was nice but feels like a tourist trap. There's really nothing there except the one view you see everyone post. Small area and you will be done in 5 minutes.
Mines View Observation Deck,"We always visit this place whenever we're in Baguio. The view from the deck itself is always as beautiful as ever. We just have a few things to say :* The place can be very crowded especially on weekends.* The road as you get near Minesview Park gets really congested because private vehicles use the roadsides as parking spots. It has already come to the point of where passing vehicles would take forever to pass the actual area. You might as well just walk on your way to the park once you're near to save time.* Getting a cab (if you don't have a private veh) can pose as a challenge when you're leaving the area. Since the road gets too congested, the cabs are having a hard time reaching the place. It's a test of patience to wait for an available ride. In our case, we just decided to walk all the way to the main road before got ourselves a ride. It's a 30 min walk, tiring as it may seem, we just had to deal with it and enjoy the scenery while walking.All in all, it's still a place that's worth visiting BUT, you have to brace yourselves for a few hiccups here and there and you need to have tons of patience with you. Visiting the place can pose as challenge now as compared to before but if you're up for an adventure then go ahead and drop by the place when you're in Baguio."
Mines View Observation Deck,Little bit hot unlike Atok so very fresh &cold👍Jungle Capital 🇵🇭
Mines View Observation Deck,"Please don’t ride the horse, I feel so sad for them, just standing there and can’t walk around."

Mines View Observation Deck,"The view is breathtakingly beautiful. It's name signifies the view - a treasure. It's a place in Baguio where you may find serenity, where you will able to expel all your worries."
Mines View Observation Deck,"This place was iconic before as it was one of the top tourist destination before, but not anymore. It has lost its glare especially the view deck which needs alot of renovations. I am just wondering what the entrance fee is for (there was none before)."
Mines View Observation Deck,The view is nothing special but the number of souvenir shops make up for it. Also the place to be if you wanna be culturally inappropriate and pay to wear the local Igorot garb for super touristy photos.
Mines View Observation Deck,Could be much better. The view deck should have been improved instead you've got the same view  all these years. But there are stalls upon stalls. Needs improvement.
Mines View Observation Deck,"One of the famous tourist attraction in baguio city. You can buy different kinds of item here from different kinds of plant, sweets, tshirts and other pasalubong from baguio. You can also have a loght snack here like the grilled dried pusit, strawberry taho and many more. It is also near to the famous goodshepherd store in baguio."
Mines View Observation Deck,"was stinky because of the dried stuff squid etc.TOO crowded it's like , it was my first time to go there so I couldn't compare but my boyfriend said it was more crowded than before .and as usual, people acts and thinks that they own the place , and no consideration for others .. ."
Mines View Observation Deck,Great place to take pictures and buy pasalubong. cr is clean.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Try visiting this place on weekdays instead of holidays and weekends, otherwise, expect a lot of people and difficulty capturing solo photos. Good sheperd - where you can buy strawberry jam, ube jam etc is nearby. There's also stores and stalls for food and other souvenir items. Check out the plants that the stalls offer as well 😊"
Mines View Observation Deck,Underwhelming. Need to develop it more. Hasn't changed in probably 50 years. Traffic parking in insane. Same old tired viewing area
Mines View Observation Deck,This place is also need to be in your bucket list for it will show you the view of Mother Nature plus a variety of pasalubong in this area

Mines View Observation Deck,Nice place. Great spot for viewing mountainous scenery. Many shops around. Great for foodies. Just be careful when going down the stairs as it is steep and curvy. Many shops renting out igorot costumes. Got binoculars renting too.Got plants shop too and many more. Toilets are available for 5 pesos each use. Make sure ro bring extra napkins as they provide very little or none at all.
Mines View Observation Deck,"If you are curious about how it looks like, then visit it 😊 You can hire a telescope (P50 per 18 mins) to use when viewing. It's a bit expensive though.. If you dont like, there are Igorot-inspired attires that you can put on. If you like, you can ride and take a picture with the horses (50.00 per 3 takes)"

Mines View Observation Deck,"Waste of time coming here. You get to view the mountain side, igorot costumes and that overly abused st bernard. Basically that's it"
Mines View Observation Deck,The view deck is clean and well maintained despite of some undisciplined tourists who randomly throw their garbage around.The view deck is one of the most common location to take sunrise pictures. There's a chance of seeing the sea of clouds if you're lucky.The best time to go there is early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid huge crowd.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Renovated, relatively well maintained. Reasonable entrance fee of P10/person. Just be aware of a lot of dog poop scattered throughout the concrete pathways during our visit. Delighted to see the St Bernard dog again for photo ops along with the horse and traditional Ifugao garbs which can be rented for a fee."
Mines View Observation Deck,The view is nice. There are many souvenir shops. You also can rent traditional clothes and take a pic. Easy to reach there by taxi and jeepney.No need much physical activities. Suitable for all ages.

Mines View Observation Deck,Still the best tourist attraction in Baguio in my opinion. Next visit I'll try seeing the sunrise there. Its unfortunate that the tourists leave garbage everywhere.
Mines View Observation Deck,Lovely view point but small and gets crowded very easily. Try to go outside of weekend peak times.
Mines View Observation Deck,It's something to see.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Breath taking view where normalcy has been observe on family members showed up with children, along with Seniors and extended family members."
Mines View Observation Deck,Mines view park it is one of the highlights of Baguio. Approximately 4km away from downtown. Just a short drive from downtown Baguio. The parks main attraction is an   observation deck that offers an imposing view of Cordillera mountain range. You can also buy pasalubong here.
Mines View Observation Deck,Great place with nice photogenic view. Very small and only for quick sessions
Mines View Observation Deck,Photographers review. The observation deck provides a good vantage point. The sun rises behind the mountain range so make sure you get there pre-dawn. They are open before sunrise.Follow me on Instagram @iamarvinyorro
Mines View Observation Deck,Excellent view but large crowds can ruin the experience. Hope they make a larger viewing deck. The current deck is dangerous especially with a crowd.
Mines View Observation Deck,love the view of overlooking
Mines View Observation Deck,Love it
Mines View Observation Deck,Mines View Park reminds me of College days. Good place to take picture and some Souvenirs stuffs
Mines View Observation Deck,It has a rwally nice view but the park is really small for a very big number of tourists. You really have to have timing to be able to take a shot. We took the Igorot photos in the Botanical garden not here but in this park you can take photos with native Igorots. Also you can find a variety of herbs here not found in other parks and tourist spots.
Mines View Observation Deck,Highly commercialized. So many people. You almost exchange faces with other people.
Mines View Observation Deck,❤

Mines View Observation Deck,"October 03, 2016"
Mines View Observation Deck,"A lot of foot traffic for a very small place. Nice scenic view, but the abandoned mines are already difficult to find because vegetation have grown to the once eroded mountains.Here you can buy plants, souvenirs or delicacies. Also, a lot of photo opportunities awaits you for php50. It's also good that there are no longer kids begging tourist for money  beside the cliff."
Mines View Observation Deck,Lotsbof people. Tourist trap. Hard to find parking
Mines View Observation Deck,Have a relaxing view of nature
Mines View Observation Deck,Difficult parking during holidays.View is good but area is crowded because this place is always on the list of places recommended for baguio visitors. They charge small entrance fee..used to have no fees before..
Mines View Observation Deck,"I wouldn't go there on a weekend. place was crowded with only a few people. pics were difficult to frame. in fairness, the place is a lot cleaner and organized than when I was a kid. the view is also better, less barren"
Mines View Observation Deck,Oh yeah! One of the more well-known Baguio attractions that gives visitors a grand view of the gold and copper mines of Benguet.
Mines View Observation Deck,"In the years past, this place was free for admission. Recently, they implemented a 20 pesos admission for adults and 10 pesos for kids.Going to the observation deck, you'd still the beauty of Baguio. Not the protected and purely undisturbed sight as I'd like to see but it's still beautiful and very much appealing.Would love to go back there again but since it's a tourist destination with a small deck, go with caution when it gets crowded."
Mines View Observation Deck,LOTS OF PEOPLE AROUND HERE FOR VACATION. NO ENTRANCE FEE. YOU CAN RENT IGOROTS COSTUME FOR 20PESOS UNLI SHOTS WITH YOUR FRIENDS. PICTURES WITH HORSE AND WITH A BIG DOG WHICH SEEMS TO TIRED ALREADY.

Mines View Observation Deck,"Nice view but gets crowded sometimes, especially on weekends.."
Mines View Observation Deck,"I don't like how the place got overly commercialized. It is called Mine's View because you were supposed to see the abandoned mines. But now all you can see are houses. I guess people just flock there for the sake of ""pasalubong""."
Mines View Observation Deck,"my dad was in the air force &  stationed at clark airforce base.he took us to Baguio city,this was 1969!i got this granite ashtray when he passed.we had great time living in base housing in Angeles city,Philippines"

Mines View Observation Deck,Too crowded. Too much stalls inside.
Mines View Observation Deck,The place is really scenic but crowded. But overall i love the place

Mines View Observation Deck,Too bad when we went there it was raining and foggy.. we can barely see the view
Mines View Observation Deck,Viewing sunset here is always a good idea👌 unless its raining😅

Mines View Observation Deck,Nice place but overcrowded at the time we were there
Mines View Observation Deck,"The location is still good as it was in the old days. The only thing is that the picture taking on saint bernard dog becomes limited. If you want an unli capture, then it is better in front of the mansion."
Mines View Observation Deck,Did not really enjoy the experience. Was too crowded and the view is not much to look at anymore.
Mines View Observation Deck,"With the taxi 100 piso, jeepney 10 piso. Very nice viewpoint. Make photo with a horse or put on traditional clothing or buy flower for thr house or garden. Many happy people to see there. Short visit in time to spend there."

Mines View Observation Deck,Very crowded considering that we visited on a weekday and off peak/holiday season.
Mines View Observation Deck,Crowds. Traffic congestion. Unfinished constructions. So many of the same things for sale. Native American headgear for picture-taking.
Mines View Observation Deck,I was surprised that it was that small when I arrived. View is no longer that amazing since Baguio's urban planning is somehow....neglegted. Highlight of coming here is to have a picture with the friendly St. Bernard (though I hope the owner will not exploit the poor dog). Tried the walkathon challenge (walked from Mine's View to Burnham). Good Shepherd is also within the area in case you are craving for ube.

Mines View Observation Deck,"If I will be given another chance to visit this place again, so will I. It's the place when u feel like your on top of the world."
Mines View Observation Deck,"The park is clean and everything is organized. But at least, monitor the price of food and souvenir items here. Most stalls sell overpriced products."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Souvenirs here are more expensive than baguio market.. so if u have the chance, go to baguio market instead. View is nice... cordilleran costumes are also for rent for your photo ops 😁"
Mines View Observation Deck,"I go here to shop for plants. They have a great selection of flower plants like orchids, lavander, local roses and many others."
Mines View Observation Deck,It is not clean anymore and not well-maintained
Mines View Observation Deck,The place is a small area where you can see the mountains and scattered houses from afar.  Nice place to chill.  Very quiet maybe because of pandemic.
Mines View Observation Deck,"lots of restaurants and souvenir shops, most of the restaurants offered fresh and delicious foods."
Mines View Observation Deck,Going in the morning to beat the crowd rewards you with a beautiful and spectacular view.
Mines View Observation Deck,I always love Baguio City. 🇵🇭❤️ the weather is so cold...🌄
Mines View Observation Deck,Good experience but there's so many people
Mines View Observation Deck,Stay in 30mins is ok :) view is great but nothing else
Mines View Observation Deck,"Same as before except their are no more mines to view, and more souvenir shops."
Mines View Observation Deck,Depends on which view deck you visit youd get this view pretty much... But the crowd depends on the viewdeck you visit
Mines View Observation Deck,I hope they will preserve the beauty and not just allow houses to be built almost everywhere in Baguio.
Mines View Observation Deck,Very beautiful place and very cold! 😂

Mines View Observation Deck,Too crowded so you don't get to see the nice view.
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice landscape view of Baguio. Parking is limited during peak days but since pandemic only a few tourist visit the place. A good place to buy souvenir items.
Mines View Observation Deck,This is the must visit location ..view is awesome ..weather is superb
Mines View Observation Deck,"It is overlooking, alright. But what i love the most are the plants they are selling. Affordable and adorable. If i can only bring them all to my place🌷🌿🌱🍀☘️🌲🌺🌻PS. Its better to ride going up. Then walk your way down to Botanical Garden. Many spots along the way..."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Now slowly back to normal,  a little crowded"
Mines View Observation Deck,The place is beautiful. There are lots of flowers and plants for sale. A paradise for plantitos and plantitas.
Mines View Observation Deck,I love the view but there's a lot people when I visit mines park. All in all this was a very beautiful place to unwine
Mines View Observation Deck,Too crowded. Too hooooooot. But whatever I'll give it 5 stars 😂  I enjoyed myself 🤣🤣
Mines View Observation Deck,"i was there yesterday with my kids. it's a bit crowded on the viewing deck, but i enjoyed the ornamental plant stalls where you can buy different succulents at reasonable prices. and their owners/sellers are so friendly (the women sellers are all beautiful! :-)). we also loved the snacks especially the grilled dried squids that are sold on the stands. i'd love to come back there when it's no longer so crowded to buy more succulents and also to enjoy the view once again."
Mines View Observation Deck,Its a bit hard to take photo perfect selfies cause the place is overcrowded.
Mines View Observation Deck,Great place to unwind and the view is great
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice place to see some mountain scenery
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice view and ggood people :)
Mines View Observation Deck,"If you're looking for a location with an overview of Baguio, souvenir shops, and food trippings. This is one of the best spots for you. :)"
Mines View Observation Deck,"The view: breathtaking as usual. Although if visiting during peak season, place can get really crowded and can make it hard for people to get onto the viewing area. Still worth visiting whenever you find yourselves going north."
Mines View Observation Deck,So tight. So many tourist. Cannot take nice pictures. So smelly also.
Mines View Observation Deck,This is a really beautiful place. It is nice on the peak of the mountain. You have a complete view of the area. It is stunning to see the clouds touching the mountains and view the entire place. Highly recommended. Make sure you bring your warm clothes since it is cold here.
Mines View Observation Deck,What a cool place.
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice place to relax and great place to enjoy the view
Mines View Observation Deck,Breathtaking places where we shouldn't miss is the Philippines.
Mines View Observation Deck,It's crowded. It does not show the view of the mines. It is more of a park now.
Mines View Observation Deck,"allowed too many people into the observation deck, not following minimum health protocol"
Mines View Observation Deck,This place is crowded compared to the first time I came here. The temperature has dramatically increased and the view that I enjoyed before is no longer the same. Prices had gone up including the 'pasalubong'. Parking spaces are not enough especially when buses are on the road. Never bring your car during lunch or later.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Traffic going up Mines View.Lots of potted plants for sale as you go to the view deck. The area is near the market for souvenirs and nick knacks and restaurants around the area.The view deck not very big but is packed with a lot of visitors.As always , the view is breathtaking.Pack a lot of patience if you plan on visiting the place."
Mines View Observation Deck,Good tourist spot in a lovely city. Plenty of shops here and good views
Mines View Observation Deck,I LOVE IT!
Mines View Observation Deck,One of the popular spot in Baguio. Good for family visit. It’s a bit crowded on the deck especially during peak season. But the view is breathtaking. A bit disappointed that you have to pay for using the toilets even though they already asked for an entrance fee.
Mines View Observation Deck,Beautiful place..😍
Mines View Observation Deck,"Too crowded. The view could be seen elsewhere in Baguio. You can actually skip this, unless it's the souvenirs outside that you're after"
Mines View Observation Deck,"The view is really amazing. However, the city could have done better to organize the flow of the people. If only there's a crew who can direct the people where to enter and exit, the experience will be more pleasant for the visitors."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Waste of time, vendors offer the same products. Plus the tourists throw their garbage anywhere. No disciplinary staff onsite."
Mines View Observation Deck,It has a nice view of the mountains! They sell souvenirs and plants/flowers
Mines View Observation Deck,Too much crowded for the business and stores inside the park..
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice view. It's just too crowded
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice view but a little bit crowded especially during weekends.
Mines View Observation Deck,Great view! Great place to buy inexpensive souvenir items
Mines View Observation Deck,"This place gives you a breathtaking view. I suggest you rent a binocular (20pesos per 5min.) for a better viewing experience. To fully enjoy your few minutes of stay, there's a booth where you can rent a traditional costume, which you can wear for your whole stay at the deck."
Mines View Observation Deck,Great view of the mountainous area and the sprawling houses alongside the road. Good possibility to buy spice plant and some ornamental flowers. Very touristic location which draws a big crowd. If you like to enjoy a serene view - you might as well forget it! Plenty of souvenir shops instead.Beware of the cooked corn cobs. Look better than they taste. Too old and probably better suited for cows.Other than that certainly a place to stop after you fought your way through the traffic.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Extremely crowded at all times, plagued with shops all over, view deck is nice but don’t expect anything impressive. They have added an entrance fee recently. Not sure how the place is going to be post-pandemic."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Heavy vehicle and foot traffic in going to the park and inside the area (esp in the observation deck). Nice view but was not able to really enjoy because the place was so crowded when we visited. Also, vendors are everywhere (selling plants, snacks, Baguio goodies, etc.). Place needs improvement though."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Stunning views of the mountains!But overly crowded during holidays and weekends. If you want to enjoy it better, go early morning!The places to eat nearby are quite expensive and unclean. So I suggest to eat elsewhere or in fast food."
Mines View Observation Deck,Thought it was a big place to walk around but it was just a small place and crowded.
Mines View Observation Deck,Best time to visit this place would be early morning. Catch the sun rise.
Mines View Observation Deck,The view was great and it adds a little mystery when fog sets in.
Mines View Observation Deck,"What a view!  It's a really cool, natural rock platform, observation area, at the top of the mountain with a breathtaking view!  There are also lots of vendors selling souvenirs/pasalubong such as t-shirts.  In addition,  there are many food vendors and we ate some freshly picked corn on the cob on a stick with melted butter and salt, which was scrumptious!"
Mines View Observation Deck,Beautiful view from a cliff. It's good for photography. It's a nature observation deck.
Mines View Observation Deck,The view is quite good but the place is over crowded with tourist.
Mines View Observation Deck,Plenty of pasalubong places. Good place to get a good view of baguio. Parking can be hard on holidays and weekends.
Mines View Observation Deck,the spot is usually crowded so i normally go here during early morning hours before sunrise.
Mines View Observation Deck,the view was nice. they have plants for sale and foid can be brought inside. i don't like how they treat the horses
Mines View Observation Deck,"One of the most popular places in Baguio, but will not recommend during holidays as you will be stuck in traffic on your way there if you have a car. This place is packed with peopke during peak season. It is better to park somewhere not near the entrance where you can leave right away. Otherwise, it will take too much time. I just recommend this during off peak so you can appreciate the view more."
Mines View Observation Deck,Rainy #paeng2022
Mines View Observation Deck,Not the way it used to be where you got a wonderful view. Now the view is peppered with a lot of houses which is painful to see. The walkway to the view deck is full of small stands selling their ware. There's a section where you can rent the mountain province costumes and take unlimited selfies/pictures for 20 pesos per person. Fantastic to see people taking pictures in costumes as it's very colorful! Wonderful smiles all around!
Mines View Observation Deck,"Maybe i just got too old but going here now was less exciting than when i went as a kid. But i was very excited for the kids being their first time, seeing their astonished faces, am glad we went, also for the wife, its her first time too. Its was not as cold or crowded as I remembered but still, it became one of my unforgettable memories and hopefully for them it was the same experience."
Mines View Observation Deck,They have developed it really well for tourists. The actual view deck is not accessible to wheelchairs or persons with disabilities but the other areas are. The view deck itself still offers a great view of the mountains though you need to be careful.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Observation Deck is quite nice. I wouldnt say its anything special, you can find similar views elsewhere just along the road or at different spots but it is a good view, so if you wish to go then its a nice viewpoint for sure. The problem is it can be very crowded and the traffic can be bad during peak hours.3 stars"
Mines View Observation Deck,Lots of plants for sale and photo opportunities in the area. You would need an hour to go around the area and take a look at the souviner shops.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Many people, still the same as prepandemic. Nice view."
Mines View Observation Deck,View is nice though the place needs to catch up with cleanliness
Mines View Observation Deck,just as the old times the sunrise is breathtaking and it is good to be out in the morning.
Mines View Observation Deck,A very good place to relax with family and friends. So many souvenir shops and food places that will make your head ache from choosing. It has a great view and clean comfort room. Beware when it's rainy and always bring your umbrellas since the weather there is unpredictable. A recommended place if you enjoy the scenery of nature.
Mines View Observation Deck,Cool place to enjoy the weekend. But a bit crowded.
Mines View Observation Deck,"If you are going to visit this place, dont forget to try their Ube and Strawberry taho."
Mines View Observation Deck,One of Baguio's most known and scenic landmark. A must visit for tourist.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Though there was a little clearing, we were astonished by the view on where this attraction is located. It was so serene that the fog made us thought that at one moment in time we are close to heaven. There was also a lot of cheap souvenir shops around the attraction. Lived the place..."
Mines View Observation Deck,2nd time here. View is always nice
Mines View Observation Deck,nice place to unwine and stress relief
Mines View Observation Deck,"The park is named Mines View since it overlooks the spectacular Baguio view of the Cordillera mountains and Benguet’s gold and copper mines. The park dates back to the American times, and it has stood the test of time. Mines View Park’s entrance fee is free for all visitors, but some activities inside like the Ifugao costume rental comes with a small fee. There are food concessionaires and souvenir stores inside. The Baguio view is breathtaking, so a camera is a must. The park is usually crowded on weekends, so make sure to come early, or just do your best to capture a good photo."
Mines View Observation Deck,Popular place to go to when in Baguio so expect a huge amount of tourist.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Awesome view especially at sunrise. Best time to take a pic at sunset. Tourist place, gets very crowded. Walking distance to Good Shepherd Jam  Factory"
Mines View Observation Deck,"At the time we visited, the place was too crouded but overall, it was a nice experience. I got to ride a horse and have a picture taken at P50/3 shots. Bought knitted clothes at a very affordable price."
Mines View Observation Deck,Beautiful view of Baguio from here. Cheap Jeepneys available to and from the Jeepney station in town.
Mines View Observation Deck,Breathtaking and you cana lso buy pasalubong here. Good shepherd is just beside the deck's parking lot so just in case you are looking for some ube jam
Mines View Observation Deck,Place is well kept and it's no longer crowded by vendors. All the vendors there selling goodies usually just buys them at the Good Sheppard and marks them up 10-50 pesos each. You will thank me for this review. BUY them at the actual store which is just around the corner. Save $$$ and the expiry of the goods are better!
Mines View Observation Deck,It seems a visit to Baguio is not complete if you don't go to Mines View Park and so we went. It's just one of those must see places in Baguio.
Mines View Observation Deck,"This place is breathtaking. I'm rather shocked to learn that admission is free (though the toilets are 5 pesos per use). There are numerous restaurants, stalls, gift and souvenir shops all around (a lot of stuff here is priced 3 for 100 pesos). You have to carefully time your shots and wait for the perfect moment to take pictures, because the fog keeps changing directions."
Mines View Observation Deck,"I view it for the 3rd time, and its still beautiful."
Mines View Observation Deck,Cool place but it gets crowded as the day progresses.
Mines View Observation Deck,After mines view...Just visit thai restaurant and experience the delicious foods.. 😘
Mines View Observation Deck,Love the sunrise! I went there around 5:40 am and the warmth and the early morning chill that lingered were perfect combination. The plants for sale were another treat to the eyes.
Mines View Observation Deck,Ive been to this place so many times but it never gets boring. The view is really amazing. If you want to appreciate the view try to be here early in the morning to beat the group of tourists coming up to this place. Relax and try their strawberry and ube taho(Soy pudding)
Mines View Observation Deck,An early morning visit should be done in order to avoid the crowd.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great view of the mountains of Baguio City, Philippines"
Mines View Observation Deck,It always happy to see the view in mines view. Its always crowded when peak season.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Very exciting place, awesome"
Mines View Observation Deck,I was fun and very relaxing! The view is great!
Mines View Observation Deck,"I must say that this place should be visited by everyone who wants to go to Baguio City. However, I would like to comment on how crowded the place is that it will make you feel uncomfortable staying there. Instead of enjoying the view, you will just feel uneasy and awkward because of the crowd. Moreover, I observed that there are people there who allow the tourists to ride on the horses that they take care of for a price. I saw how these horses suffered from this unbearable situation, but they are forced to stand there and act like they want to stay. I am sad for them, really. 🙁"
Mines View Observation Deck,"It’s too commercialized. Horses are all abused, like putting different accessories on their faces and changing the colors or their hairs. I really don’t like the way it is right now. Been there 25 yrs ago and it was really a pleasant place to visit."
Mines View Observation Deck,One of my favorite tourist spots in Baguio..Breathtaking ang overlooking!!!
Mines View Observation Deck,It’s a good place to take a picture and buy some cacti and succulents.
Mines View Observation Deck,"gets kinda crowded since it's a tourist spot, you can get a great selfie with the cordillera mountain range as your background; parking can be an extreme challenge though, specially during summer and Christmas holidays; good thing the good shepherd convent is just a few minutes walk away."
Mines View Observation Deck,Beware of tourist traps. 50php per 3 photos when you ride the horses
Mines View Observation Deck,"Beautiful place,must visit for the awesome view of old mining town."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Its my first time in Bagiuo City,and we all enjoyed it..."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Place is very crowded, you will have a hard time finding parking, better to use public transportation going here.A lot of pick pocket here be sure to be alert and vigilant.Some good restaurants are near here have some extra cash in case.The view is not as good as it was, the mines where not preserve."
Mines View Observation Deck,So beautiful i really love to comeback here
Mines View Observation Deck,A little crowded especially on weekends.
Mines View Observation Deck,"At peak hours/season, the place gets crowded. If you want to enjoy sight seeing in peace, then you'd be disappointed. Also, touriats there do not have any discipline. There are random plastic wrappers and bottles strewn about the area"
Mines View Observation Deck,"I didn't actually went to the Mines View Observatory itself, my family members went there, though. I simply enjoyed looking at the plants that were being sold at the entrance bcz some of these are rare...i had no enough cash with me and so i lost the opportunity to acquire anything..."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Some random dude was being a jerk on the horses but it had really good views. This is a must see destinations if you go to Baguio. Taxi ride cost exactly 160, and it was very easy to find a cheap going back to the city for a 10 pesos only. The views are great, and there’s lots of snacks and souvenir shops."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Very nice place and very good views. Be careful with the guy with a St. Bernard dog. He is a ripper. Also don't buy souvenirs here, it's way too expensive. If you want Baguio shirts for your photo shoot in Mines View, better stop at the shops in Botanical Gardens before heading up to Mines View, they are way cheaper, souvenirs are cheaper here too."
Mines View Observation Deck,Definitely  go to place when you visit Baguio.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Good improvements on the rails and guide handles,,"
Mines View Observation Deck,A very excellent view that can take your breath away. Only if the other tourists would focus more on enjoying the scene instead of taking a lot of pictures.
Mines View Observation Deck,"great view, good people and definite must when in Baguio. Stop and check out the vendors so many lovely souvenirs to be bought. That view!!! Is spectacular. Baguio is a truly unique city in the mountains a real world treasure. I see why filipino flock here."
Mines View Observation Deck,Mines view over view is a little bit dirty. Plastics are a plenty
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice to visit early in the morning
Mines View Observation Deck,"As usual,beautiful views"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Park is an overlook park on the northeastern outskirts of Baguio in the Philippines. It is five kilometers away from the Heart of Baguio, passing through the Botanical Garden, the Mansion House, Wright Park, and the Pacdal Circle."
Mines View Observation Deck,Still has a great view.. but would want to bring back the old look of the park itself and take out the retail stores beside the park and inside the park.The gate is too colorful similar with the lions head.
Mines View Observation Deck,"The view is still breathtaking, but would be best if you visit it on a weekday so that there are fewer people.Also, I like the old Mines View Park entrance better and when there are no stores beside and inside the park."
Mines View Observation Deck,Cool place in Baguio...love the view.
Mines View Observation Deck,Very nice tourists spot
Mines View Observation Deck,"This place is already crowded. Sadly it is alot more beautiful back then when i last visited this,like about 8 years. Be aware of your valuables it might get lost because of the crowd. Taking pictures with the native (Igorot) , st. Bernard dogs and horses will cost you money, so just don't be surprised."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great view! Affordable plants (money maker, bonsai, cactus, etc.), pasalubong (foods, shirts, etc.). We bought some plants, we have to secure a plant permit before we could transport it by plane and ship. Tried dressing up costume for Php 25, unlimited shots and no time limit. The only downside is that there were a lot of people in the deck. It can be somewhat uncomfortable. So we only stayed and took photos there for a few minutes."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Therw are ways to observe the view from the deck, but what I don't get is how people walk down the little aisle just to capture some photo. That may endanger their life when they recklessly do it. It would be nice if there are people who will do an outlook anytime there are aliens around."
Mines View Observation Deck,"I'm not quite sure what's so attractive about this place. But there seems to be a lot of people who come in droves here.We just happened to stay in one of the hotels nearby - just a minute walk from the gate of this place - and we checked this place out, seeing so many people going here despite the drizzling and cold weather.It's very crowded in here, at least on weekends and holidays; lots vendors - street food, potted plants, native/souvenir stuff and many others.There's no entrance fee, the place is open to the public. The view is supposed to be really nice from here, but that is not my impression. The views along the roads in the Mountain Province or even just on the way to La Trinidad/Baguio from La Union."
Mines View Observation Deck,Hi. Have been here on holiday from UK. Baguio is a very interesting place to visit. Recommend you to visit. Hotel in the area are reasonable price. Lots to see. Very nice Army training camp to visit with own meusem.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Amazing view. Went there on a Monday morning that's why there's only few people were there and we got a chance to have this picture taken. Never go there if there are a lot of people because you won't enjoy the place. We never tried the photo-ops with the big dog and the photo-ops while wearing an Igurot costume since for us, it's nonsense."
Mines View Observation Deck,It's too crowded but the view is great.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Sadly, Mines View is teeming with insurmountable businesses including use of poor horses"
Mines View Observation Deck,The place is crowded with people but the souvenirs are very cheap!
Mines View Observation Deck,"This place is filled with animals having sex with each other. I watched a couple of horses have sex. There were several other horses surrounding them and cheering them on. And they have a nice gift shop also. If you like to watch animals bang each other, this is the place for you!"
Mines View Observation Deck,"To appreciate more what Baguio City has to offer, you should not miss the Mines View Park where you can rent a native costume, take picture with a St. Bernard doggie, ride a colorful dressed-horse and buy souvenirs for your friends and loved-ones.You can also see the mountainous city of Baguio in here. 😍"
Mines View Observation Deck,Great views and friendly staff. Extensive tourist kind of shopping. I bought a purple chili plant. Decent places to eat and chain restaurants nearby. Even horseback riding not far away.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Three stars,the cliff and the horses i expected too much."
Mines View Observation Deck,"A lot of food, souvenir and strawberry"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Minesview has great sights but is incredibly overcrowded and underwhelming by itself. It has nice and cheap shops around it, eateries and even souvenir places, but the observation deck itself always has people in it - making it a literally tourist trap.I suggest going on a clear weekday with no holiday to avoid the rush of excursionists.Some of the ways to enjoy the place is to wear traditional Igorot clothes, get photos from the albino horses and look for some mountain plants.A little bit underwhelming."
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice places you can go anywhere what you want
Mines View Observation Deck,"To be fair, we were there just before Christmas and it's a busy tourist time, but to be honest the view wasn't worth the fight for taxis, the push and shove of the hundreds of people. It was impossible to take a nice clear photo because there were just too many people."
Mines View Observation Deck,"As a local, Ive seen better view. Its just a place of business. A good place to buy souvenirs for fair price, you might need to ask prices from different stores to get the most of your money. A good place to take pictures if youre into horses that have hair dyes, some say its animal abuse but its for you to judge. There are better places for horse back rides and taking pictures. You can take pictures with the famous minesview St Bernards, (there are three of them probably more and they take shifts by the way). Really not a recommended place to go on a weekend or a holiday. The traffic going might not be worth it. One thing unique about the place is the grilled dry squid dipped in vinegar, its the only place in baguio where its sold (as far as I know)."
Mines View Observation Deck,I think they should improve the place it's more like a market than seeing a view I appreciate the 1st time i went there without the markets no restaurant around so that u can really see the beauty of the place just green trees and fresh air now u can smell the smoke squid their preparing and markets arround the place.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Nice place. Not much to do. With lots of plants to choose from and take home. Also, the museum of the crafts of the indigenous people is something. It makes me appreciate my culture more."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great view..... Nice place to see with your family during vacation.  There are also many souvenir shop to visit.  And don't forget to visit Good Shepherd,  and buy some different jams...."
Mines View Observation Deck,Mostly a shopping destination..although the prices here are steeper compared to other souvenir stores within baguio.Yes you can see a mountain view at the viewing deck but you will literally have to fight for a space to take a pic otherwise you will end up in some else's frame. 😂 or just wait for the crowd to thin out a bit before you could have a few seconds to snap.a.photo with the mountains as back drop.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Very nice view but probably more beautiful on a bright, sunny day. We went there and the weather wasn't that cooperative but we still enjoyed the place and the view of course. Going back for sure."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Not really much to see and do here. Just a view of the mountains that you can take a picture of and that's about it. There are many souvenir shops and street food sold outside. Plus, its walking distance from The Good Shepherd where you can buy their famous Ube Jam~"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great views many souvenirs to buy. Local foods, clothes etc. A good first place to visit in baguio"
Mines View Observation Deck,"This place is one of the most visited attraction in Baguio and there's no entrance fee, the place is good for taking photos and selfies cause the lighting is very nice, the view is nice and for sure people who like to have their selfies get that natural glow from the sun, you might want to go here, you can also rent the ethnic Igorot clothes from the locals there to take pictures. Transportation is easy cause you'll just need to ride a taxi and they'll take you there. Souvenir shops are also all over the place so you won't have to worry in buying some for your self, loved ones or friends."
Mines View Observation Deck,"The place is okay. I grew up in a very similar place so I couldn't tell what's special about it. There were lots of tourists when I got there.. Overview deck was pretty much crowded.. though you really get to see a bird's eye view of the valley & mountains that surround the fiew houses (or buildings)..There was also a park.. there was a horse, a real one, with pink hair for picture taking that cost around 100 philippine peso (soo expensive), and that Beethoven dog too. Lots of cactus & other souvenir items for sale. It was a crowded place. Maybe i would've appreciated it more if there were only few people.."
Mines View Observation Deck,"You can see the wonders and beautiful creations of God, How amazing... The view of the houses located at the mountain. The cool weather, no need to use air-conditioned unit."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines view is part of the checklist that you shouldn't miss. Great views. Expect to see allot of people there. You can have a picture with the st. Bernard dog, horse, or try to wear the Igorot costume."
Mines View Observation Deck,It's a refreshing experience! Nice to see the beauty of nature at its best. The good climate in Baguio is perfect not only for family get away with the hassle and bustle of work and city life back in Valenzuela.
Mines View Observation Deck,"if you go there at this time there is actually no mine to be seen anymore. The place has become a standard destination for tourists though, and stores and shops have opened around it. Still, its a must-see for first timers given its place in Baguio. Traffic is still horrendous over weekends and i would suggest to pack light and be prepared to walk 1-2kms so you wont waste time in trafficThe mines are now subdivisions."
Mines View Observation Deck,Bring your friends!
Mines View Observation Deck,"Very crowded, especially on weekends. Be very cautious of pick pockets; otherwise will give you a nice view. Most prices of goods here are higher than the real retail price. I prefer to go to Good Shepherd or Public Baguio Market for better products.Activities:You can rent Igorot costumes for 25 pesos.Take pictures with a Saint Bernard.Ride colorful horses (stationary) for picture purposesBuy in TianggesBuy Succulents, flowers, fruit bearing plantsEnjoy street foods"
Mines View Observation Deck,Nature is Art - Love for the land and people ensures future generations to appreciate ✌🏾💕🌏💧🌱
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great place to bring your guests or family for a quick visit and replenishments / refreshments. Love the bulalo, corn and cheese and the barbequed dried squid. Reasonably priced too. If you are souvenir hunting for relatives or your kid's teachers, this is a good place to get souvenirs or delicacies just make sure you bring along your bargaining skills with you."
Mines View Observation Deck,Can be hard to find parking. Big variety of souvenirs and plants to buy. Only one outlet that sells coffee grind and it's not always open. The view was cloudy and dark because of the monsoon rains.
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice view and good location for clicking some pics.
Mines View Observation Deck,still the best area for Baguio Sunrise :-) Note though that the place has an entrance fee now (PHP 10)
Mines View Observation Deck,It's a very nice and cozy place to go!
Mines View Observation Deck,Amazing and beautiful place to unwind and relax.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Nice view above the mountains in Baguio, free place to visit. You can almost touch the clouds. Surrounded by many stores for gifts, and souvenirs.Highly recommended."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Visiting this place is one of the highlights of my recent Baguio trip. The temperature of Baguio and its cozy surroundings when combined together creates a very relaxing vibe. Even though there were lots of other tourists when we got there, it is still worth it. The view is breath taking. I am definitely going back here. There were also activities to try in this part of Baguio such as trying out Igorot costumes for only 20 pesos, horseback riding (wherein you'll just take a picture with a horse) and many more. There were also lots of stalls and stores here that sell different products such as plants and souvenirs. :)"
Mines View Observation Deck,"How could I not share my review about this tourist destination in Baguio? This is perhaps include in the top most visited place in the Philippines. Obviously, there's no more mining activities down there. But it is a manifestation how rich the place is in terms of natural resources. It is not only about tourism."
Mines View Observation Deck,Make sure you come in early to get the right opportunity to take a photo! The place can be very crowded at peak times. Try to take a photo during golden/blue hour for that perfect snap.
Mines View Observation Deck,You can still see some mountain slopes but not like before
Mines View Observation Deck,"The place is okay, the view is meh, but still good for pictures though. There are many little potted plants and bonzais here though. After visiting this place you can head over The Good Shepherd for the pasalubongs for the family."
Mines View Observation Deck,"As a local, I appreciate how much Igorot symbolism is showcased here. Good job to whomever is playing Igorot-themed music in some areas. The place is surprisingly clean despite the floods of tourists.The place is becoming smaller and smaller as more people come in, which is a good thing. But the surrounding vendors really ruin the experience especially that each booth serve the same thing, be it food or souvenirs. I wish Mines View choose to prioritize businesses that promote experience rather than just being lazy and display overdone souvenirs."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Go here eqrly in the morning like 7 AM and you have the whole place for yourself. It's peaceful, the fog is wonderful it's like you are really in the clouds. Perfect for meditation and just quiet time. You can also take advantage of the tourist services in Minesview with no queue."
Mines View Observation Deck,"The place has gotten so crowded, there's just so little room to actually enjoy the view. The market outside, is okay I guess, since it will offer you just as many , if not, more choices than those found at the Baguio Night Market."
Mines View Observation Deck,"This is one of the historical places of Baguio the Mines View Park. Aside from the busy kiosk, restaurant, market and for souvenirs. This is the complete place were you can see everything. You can have a picture taking from the colorful horse that they have. They also have Saint Bernard dog's they are really sweet and friendly. If you want to become an Igorot for a day you can dress like one. You like nature, orchids or plants they also have it in one place."
Mines View Observation Deck,It is a great place with a great view. It is one of the must see places in Baguio. Aside from taking pictures with the view you can also take pictures while wearing a traditional costume from there with a affordable price. There are also souvenirs and different plants that you can buy.
Mines View Observation Deck,"The view itself is subpar but the experience along with it is fun. You can rent a clothes the resembles the lokal there or what they call a ""bahag"", take a picture while riding a horse and the best part in this place is the stores. There are so many souvenir shops in here with very affordable prices."
Mines View Observation Deck,"With a great view, souvenir items, and great shops -- this surely is a must place to visit. 5 stars! Definitely recommend."
Mines View Observation Deck,"A very nice view, though becoming less natural and more residential.  Nice tourist spot to take pictures and collect souvenirs.  Dress up like an igorot and enjoy the view."
Mines View Observation Deck,Great view!
Mines View Observation Deck,"Small deck, but with a great overlooking view. This is one of the old tourist spot in Baguio greatly preserved. My lola Luring took us here when I was around 7-8 years of age (now I'm 48yrs)"
Mines View Observation Deck,Very nice
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice view
Mines View Observation Deck,One of the best places to visit in Baguio.Be considerate of other people by not hogging a spot.
Mines View Observation Deck,"It has really changed a lot. The place lost its former glory, serenity was lost due to over development... Before, it was a tourist spot with a few stores selling souvenirs and sweetcorn. Now, it's like Divisoria's 168 on top of the mountain."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Be early to get a good spot cause by 5am there are already many people with their cams at a ready. But all in all, great view. It's worth the wait and the chilly breeze."
Mines View Observation Deck,Just visit when it sunny days for perfect view
Mines View Observation Deck,"people here are very courteous, the place also have access ramp for PWD's"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Park has been renovated and the land contouring was fascinating, not to mention the ever-dazzling view of mountain range which is more appreciating at breaking dawn. 😊Do a morning sight-seeing with a hot cup of coffee or the ever famous Strawberry taho."
Mines View Observation Deck,Crowded as usual! But still a spot to visit!
Mines View Observation Deck,"A good place to view sunrise or sunset. They also offer pictures with a horse and 2 big dogs. A good place to buy bonsai, cactus, and some plants. The is a stall here where some Good Shepherd products were sold"
Mines View Observation Deck,Amazing place ☺️💖
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice and enjoy our trips 😊.
Mines View Observation Deck,"This park without a doubt is always crowded but worth visiting ! A lot of snack, souvenir shop options, great photo shoot opportunities and most importantly has the best view of Baguio city!"
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice to be back @ summer capital of Philippines
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Park contiues to be the best place to get your goodies and ""pasalubong"" if you're looking for the cheap deals.  However, there's waaaayyy too many people. So much so you can no longer appreciate the view that much. Still a good place to go to though..."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great view you can see the abandon mining area and the top view of baguio city. You can see here the st. Bernards dog, colorful horses, beautiful plants for sale, and you can dress like a locals.   And also good for the heart."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Again, memories of the old days of long ago and all i can think of is mi Querida Señorita."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Still good scenery people still love to go and take some selfies shot.  Traffic during peak season and during December lots of people goes in and out of mines view park. Horse back riding,  igorot inspired robes and some souvenirs. Still exciting place to go specially newbies"
Mines View Observation Deck,"The place can be pretty crowded during the day.One of Baguio's best spots to watch the sunrise. Shops are closed, not a lot of people there and you'll enjoy the relative silence."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Nothing much is to be expected here. It's a simple viewing deck. But if you're on your way to buy some souvenirs, this is the place since stuff sold here is cheap. Also, this is quite near to Good Shepherd"
Mines View Observation Deck,Go there early morning to get the best view of sunrise. We went there for a photoshoot. The crack of dawn makes dramatic separation of dark and light. The sunrise is magnificent.
Mines View Observation Deck,"The place is okay. One of the most visit worthy in baguio. Just make sure to go in there when its not foggy. The place has a lot to offer. Foods, photo ops with the big dogs, horseback riding, ornamental plants for sale and other souvenir items."
Mines View Observation Deck,Always crowded. Authority doesn't seem to care of controlling visitors. Can't find a perfect place to take a picture. But the view is awesome. Go here to meet huge and cute St. Bernard dogs.
Mines View Observation Deck,It was too crowded when we got there but the view was spectacular.
Mines View Observation Deck,"For first timers you have to visit this place especially if you love buy plants, flowers and pasalubong. At the last point you can see the view of the mountains and feel the cold breeze."
Mines View Observation Deck,😍
Mines View Observation Deck,Go early in the morning to avoid the crowd and get good parking space. Low fogs make dramatic photos too. Check out the market stalls. Be sure to haggle for best prices.
Mines View Observation Deck,"If you want to enjoy seeing the beauty of Baguio, you can go to Mines View. Take selfie picture with background of the view. You can't help but enjoy how close you can be to the sky as the place is too high. All in all the view is breath taking"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Went there as I was taking my Chinese clients to visit Baguio. Food was reasonably priced AND good! Just bad that the weather let us down as it started to pour. All in, they had a great time there."
Mines View Observation Deck,You will love the place! Wonderful! 😊😊
Mines View Observation Deck,"I find it filty and not well maintain.  The site for horse picturial booth is too smelly. The St. Bernard's picture site, I feel so pity with the dog for they looks so tired and abuse to make a living. But the restroom is quite acceptable. Hopefully the management will maintain the cleanliness of the site the way it used to be."
Mines View Observation Deck,I love the view of the place it was cool and so many different flowers also. Place lots tourist visiting. You will also enjoy your photo taking session on this place because of the breathtaking view of the mountain.
Mines View Observation Deck,Still accommodating place and a good tourist spot....
Mines View Observation Deck,Place can get too crowded but the souvenirs are good buy.
Mines View Observation Deck,"There were good changes in the park complex but the same old problem of cramp, overly jam-packed observation area is something that can be upgraded and improved but they chose not to. If anything, you can't even get a good panoramic shot nowadays."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Usually crowded, secure your belongings for pick pockets are common."
Mines View Observation Deck,Good place. Overlooking view.One of the tourists spot in Baguio.They stalls for souvenirs.They have horses for a picture taking.A wishing well.A small place but good enough.
Mines View Observation Deck,A very beautiful spot to see the mountains 🏔😍💕
Mines View Observation Deck,"Sadly the place has become mainly just a commercial area, for selling souvenirs, restaurants and the like, unlike before when it was really a viewing area for the various mines below which is really the main attraction, it has then gradually become a view with rooftops of houses. Just saying IMO."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Nice view, nice weather. Lots of shops for souvenirs. You just have to look around first.Bring enough cash because there weren't any available atms around."
Mines View Observation Deck,I love how hospitable the elders where we rent the Bahag's huhu. I love the view here.
Mines View Observation Deck,Best for family tour. Best for barkadas too.Baguio City pasalubong items and delicacies are plenty in here. Though so crowded but its still good for tourist. Just be careful with personal belongings.
Mines View Observation Deck,"The place itself is beautiful. The view from the deck is wide and far, and offers a great view of the mountains of baguio (just... font look down below the viewdeck since a residential area ruins the view)  But when you consider other factors, the place suffers the conditions that afflicts tourist traps. The place is commonly overcrowded. Trash litters everywhere. Too many vendors have set up shop, furthering cluttering the little space left for tourists. If you intend to go here, i suggest going on a schoolday. Thats the best time to be able to appreciate the quiet beauty of baguio."
Mines View Observation Deck,Very cool place👌
Mines View Observation Deck,Very good ❤️🍃
Mines View Observation Deck,Great views and attractions
Mines View Observation Deck,"Many things are happening here from the view which is kinda breathtaking (you have to read why this place was called mines view park. Photos with a hairdyed horse, a huge dog or even take some shots with you wearing the traditional costumes."
Mines View Observation Deck,"So far, the place is quiet and not crowded as less tourist visit the area. Enjoy sunset or sunrise here."
Mines View Observation Deck,"The area has not changed since my last visit. There are still this local costume picture taking, selfies with the big dogs (st. bernard dogs) and pink horses. The view was rather disappointing. People, by the way, are nice. Lots of souvenir shops. Taho was good."
Mines View Observation Deck,Great view! Love wearing the Igorot costume. ❤️
Mines View Observation Deck,Naisu! Great view!😃
Mines View Observation Deck,"I like the view and the weather, the sellers were very friendly and accommodating."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Awesome place and there are lots of souvenir stores here too. I just think the people with the horse and dogs are rip offs, 50php for 3 shots? Come on people. Still 5 stars for an awesome park!"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Trash everywhere. Tourist and locals are not disposing there trash properly. Crowded, heavy traffic and smells awful. Local government and citizens are not taking care of this tourist spot. Sad that it will not last long in the future if these will continue."
Mines View Observation Deck,Its a very good place to visit. It has a insanely good view. Perfect for tourist to picture. Theres also shops nearby this observation deck which has a lot of goodies.
Mines View Observation Deck,Fantastic
Mines View Observation Deck,Well the place is really good but the main problem on this is the parking space.
Mines View Observation Deck,Great place with amazing views. This is a big tourist spot so it can get kind of crowded on the observation deck. I recommend coming here on a weekday at non-peak times for the best experience.
Mines View Observation Deck,"This is where I catch the sunrise in photos. We walk from my place for about 15 minutes usually at 5:30am and sit patiently for the sunrise colors on the horizon and for the sun itself to peep from behind the glorious mountains, heralding the start if another beautiful Baguio day."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Almost impossible parking to get dressed up like an Igorot, sit on a pony, and take pictures.  You can eat the same foods, and get the same pasalubong and t-shirts in virtually any other tourist trap (and market) in Baguio.  Mine's View can be done once, then 🤷"
Mines View Observation Deck,A very picturesque location. We enjoyed taking pictures and buying souvenirs
Mines View Observation Deck,it's quite a view
Mines View Observation Deck,Great place to be with nature!
Mines View Observation Deck,Ambiance is cool...i love it...
Mines View Observation Deck,It was too crowded when we got there. The view was quite nice but it is so hard to take a picture because of all the people. We probably took 2 shots and then left.
Mines View Observation Deck,The view's the same but there's a lot of people taking selfies which ruins your moment.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Historical. Come, if it's your first time.  It's a must. A lot of tourist do.  But if it's your nth time and cant be bothered to go down there, let your companions, while you yourself chill w Ifugao music w the street food vendors at the entrance."
Mines View Observation Deck,great view. nice experience 😊
Mines View Observation Deck,"If you want to have a photo riding in the hourse, you can get it here. The view is spectacular for those who love nature. Also there are pasalubong you can buy in there."
Mines View Observation Deck,Good spot for picture taking.
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice view on the old mines.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Nice view, but not the 1st thing to do in Cebu"
Mines View Observation Deck,Now with entrance fee. Lots of houses now in the background view. It used to be green.
Mines View Observation Deck,So nice so beutiful. Lets go on.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Observation Deck among other site activities is a venue especially for photographers who love landscape photography. The site is peaceful and quiet from 5 am-6 am when few tourists start to arrive. Enjoy the breathtaking landscape panorama of e.g., Benguet's Itogon views. The place offers one of the best sunrise landscape photography. There is no entrance free and the place is open until 8 p.m."
Mines View Observation Deck,A popular location for tourist in Baguio to visit. There are a lot of people who goes to thisnplace especially in the afternoon. You can rent native costumes to have a picture as well as colored-hair horses.
Mines View Observation Deck,"In terms of Nature.. I can give it only 4 stars because there is so much rebuilding going on soon it will be called mines view city, and the 2 stars are for being over crowded.. be it inside or outside.. you can't enjoy the moment because of the uncontrolled crowd.I hope someone plan and do the proper thing before everything gets out of hand or it already has."
Mines View Observation Deck,"We actually walked from our accommodation to this place but it was fine because the panoramic view was great, can get a little crowded though so take those pictures good, and take them fast."
Mines View Observation Deck,Very relaxing place with the cool breeze of Baguio! People are all friendly!
Mines View Observation Deck,Lesser pine trees that makes the place bare and dryCannot see more of the mines anymore cause there are alot of houses in the mines. I could see house roof instead of pine trees.Felt sad more concrete improvements has been made that does not give the old Baguio feel anymore.
Mines View Observation Deck,nice clear view of mines
Mines View Observation Deck,One of Bagio City landmark place to check
Mines View Observation Deck,It stole my heart. Chos
Mines View Observation Deck,"You are like watching the whole world if you are situated here. Seeing those houses below sprouting like mushrooms, an experience that you can proudly share to anybody. It may make you oblivious about your present sorrows and problems. So when you plan to visit the province of Benguit, dont forget to plan a route here."
Mines View Observation Deck,Not one of the places you that you can think of going back to. The view is still good but the area is too overcrowded. I can't help to compare the experience that I had when I went there in late 90s to the ones that I had from 2000s to 2010s.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Scenic view,with variety of plants and comodities."
Mines View Observation Deck,Love the place. Although its crowded.
Mines View Observation Deck,You can see the majestic view of Baguio's nature here. Also free of entrance plus you can take pictures with the dogs or horses her for a fee though.
Mines View Observation Deck,Beautiful view where pictures can give proper justice
Mines View Observation Deck,20 Entrance Fee
Mines View Observation Deck,The place is being developed. There are handrails now and the grounds no longer poses a high risk of stumbling. Businesses have their proper places although parking space is still a problem.
Mines View Observation Deck,The view is perfect except that its too crowded when we were there.Besides the view are the foods around being sold and the souvenir shops too were the ones that add enjoyment to our tour there.
Mines View Observation Deck,For me the best view at Baguio
Mines View Observation Deck,"Lots of plants sellers, a destination for plantitos and plantitas. Not much has change from the old mines view we remember"
Mines View Observation Deck,Relaxing place.. wonderful panoramic view.
Mines View Observation Deck,Great view. Too bad because it's crowded with people. I didn't take much picture. Just enjoyed the scenic view.
Mines View Observation Deck,This spot is excellent. You get a great view of the hillside and valley of baguio. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. I had dinner with my wife and she was impressed by the view.
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice place you can wear igorot costume for only 25 pesos. They also sell various plants that are very affordable. Plus you can have a pic with the st bernard dog.
Mines View Observation Deck,It was great experience
Mines View Observation Deck,"This is a place to see if you want to experience the feeling of being ""on the top of the world"". 😁"
Mines View Observation Deck,"When you visit the place, be sure to bring your own binoculars since the rental fee is pretty expensive. Also, you can't easily park near the place since it is always crowded even on weekdays."
Mines View Observation Deck,Love it this place. Ovelooking
Mines View Observation Deck,A nice place to check the view of the mines in Baguio. Just be careful because the place can get pretty crowded. Lots of street food can be bought and souvenir items around fthe area.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Ow he loves Philippines🇵🇭 I guess. Tho we couldn't get to our target which is the rice terraces because the weather is getting nasty, and locals are advised us to cancel going there because the road are muddy and prone to landslide."
Mines View Observation Deck,Wonderful place and great view
Mines View Observation Deck,You can enjoy a great view of the mountains here but observation deck is quite small and it gets crowded too easily.
Mines View Observation Deck,"It is a nice place to shop for ""Coming back from a trip Presents"" or Pasalubong.  However the observation deck itself is not something that would be on top of my list to revisit.  This is because the deck area are hogged by tourists taking their photos like they are on a private photo shoot.It is just impractical to stand on those slippery boulders like begging for an accident just to have our own photos, because the paved deck is hogged.  Paying for little things including a picture with a St. Bernard dog is little crazy and becoming unappealing atmosphere to tourists to visit.  Yes it is helping local economy, but it is not nice to be taken advantaged on, just because.The park entrance is free, but it looks like a market scene than a place with peace and quiet as parks should be.   If you haven't been there it is fine to visit, but it is not a place I would recommend to revisit."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Nicw view, cold weather"
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice view but too crowded
Mines View Observation Deck,"You shouldn't miss this place when visiting Baguio City. There's a cool view overlooking the beautiful mountain and also a ride of the beautiful horse, plus the native costume for your memorable photos."
Mines View Observation Deck,Enjoying trip and the coldest day of Baguio City with my Brod Jhonny Grapes.
Mines View Observation Deck,Cool Breeze and Amazing Overview of Baguio
Mines View Observation Deck,Still a great place for a good view and picture taking.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Park is 15 minutes away from town where formerly, you can view the Mines but now, you can just see houses and no Mines at all. Since it has been considered as a Land Mark of the City of Baguio, you can enjoy the fresh air while taking pictures at the view deck..."
Mines View Observation Deck,Gets crowded at times but still beautiful.
Mines View Observation Deck,perfect to watch the sunrise here. because of the cold weather not many wake up early to catch the the sunrise. bring a cup/thumbler of coffee or hot choco.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Overrated and super crowded. To be fair, I came here during the peak season though. People just came up here to have their photos taken with the backdrop that was average at best. Too many people just fiddling with their phones posting their shots rather than enjoying nature itself."
Mines View Observation Deck,"In Bagio this one is the famous spot of scenic view of mountains and fogs. One can buy small artifacts, memoirs, handicrafts etc from a large number of shops available thereat. Various kinds of plants one can buy."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Beauty of nature at it's best, hopefully organization do something about more strict rules about throwing garbage. Because I've seen plastics everywhere. it's so sad that people ones again is slowly destroying the spot."
Mines View Observation Deck,"A good place to visit in Baguio. Although, during peak days and hours, it can get full making it hard to have a photo op. Nonetheless, shops and more are conveniently located within the area."
Mines View Observation Deck,Still a breathenpf fresh air. Visiting this place in Baguio never gets old.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Minesview is never a-missed tourist stop over whenever we are in Baguio. Though most of the time we go there, traffic congestion is always the same issue. This hillview of Baguio is always packed with tourists and locals, though parking and passing through are always a challenge, we just cant seem to resist visiting this, as we crave for their local grilled foods, pasalubong sweets, novelty items, cheap potted plants, and the nostalgic feeling of the cold and breezy Baguio feels. Good thing the local government keeps improving this place, as they anticipate heavy flocks of tourists on holidays. We still keep going here to check what's new or any newly opened restaurants will tickle our taste buds :)"
Mines View Observation Deck,Lots of tourists all the time.  Getting a good pic is hard.  The view is beautiful but there still something to improve.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Perhaps i have such a high expectation... the view has lost its charm... i cant explain it, it just didnt hold any more magic for me.. this would be my 2nd time to come here... the first time was about 28 years ago."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Same as before, now with entrance fees to help maintain the area"
Mines View Observation Deck,Viewa are still awesome but its too crowded and merchandise are expensive
Mines View Observation Deck,"The place is nice to be honest, but it's chilly so you gotta get yourself covered, okay? You can take a loooot of pictures; with the cute Saint Bernards, with horses, wearing the Igorot costume, and the mountainous view itself. You can also buy pasalubongs and they sell plants too"
Mines View Observation Deck,"It's a freezing exploration at baguio city with swart especially our experience at mines view park, though it heavily rains but photo ops continue. The whole place is engulfed with fog. Swan boating under the rain is fun."
Mines View Observation Deck,Nature! Picturisque ✨
Mines View Observation Deck,"Very crowded but then just about everywhere you go in the Philippines it is crowded. Nice view and great place to buy souvenirs, live plants, and some plant seeds."
Mines View Observation Deck,It still is a must visit place in Baguio.. it's a famous tourist spot you could see on post cards so bear the crowd and the heat and the pricey souvenir shops... it's all part of the Mines View experience..
Mines View Observation Deck,I really liked the place because it so cold...
Mines View Observation Deck,"The only thing that I hate in this place is when you to this place over crowded taking picture at the over look sight.But over all this place is a good place to by pasalubongs at the nearby souvenir shops.You can also buy at Good Sheperd store near in the place (5-10mins walk from Mines View) to buy specialty goods like strawberry jam, ube jam and etc for your family and friends."
Mines View Observation Deck,Not too crowded when off peak 😊
Mines View Observation Deck,No longer as it used to be.  Too many stores. Too much commercialization. The obeaervation deck remains the same. But mines view as a whole isn't as attractive as the good old days. For souvenir shopping mostly especially for tourists.
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice view
Mines View Observation Deck,"The place has changed and improved a lot over the years. They still have the usual gimmicks, though. Picture-taking on a horse or with St Bernard dogs. Igorot outfits for rent for pictorials within the park. Good place to buy pasalubong shirts, peanut brittle, strawberry jams and small plant variants."
Mines View Observation Deck,"I used to go here and still goes whenever I'm in Baguio.  The main observatory deck is full of trash due to lots of tourists. There's no trash bin near so people opted to throw trashes anywhere. I believe you can mandate a No Food policy inside the viewing deck, besides you're there to view Not to eat.2nd the mines view park signage on the left side is no photo worthy the background has a lot of different sari sari store signage and any advertising ad. You can have a wall there so it blocks that and people are not bothered by the background."
Mines View Observation Deck,This is the place where you can go back again and again...🌲💖  
Mines View Observation Deck,Still many construction going on outside.
Mines View Observation Deck,Overlooking the former mines of Baguio. It's a great place to enjoy the mountain sceneries while enjoying shopping for your friends and family. Don't forget to drop by at Pantew restobar at Pinewood Place for a cup of brewed coffee. Then head to Goodshepherd convent for their famous ube jam and peanut brittles.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Park is an overlook park on the northeastern outskirts of Baguio in the Philippines, which is  5 kms  from city center, worth visiting for  awesome  views and  especially  watch  the  sunrise .I would  suggest to come  here  after  visting  Botanical Garden, the Mansion House, Wright Park, and the Pacdal Circle.Worth visiting when you are in Baguio."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Just feel the cool breeze, eat corn and grilled squid. You can purchase plants if you want, take a horse pic and buy souvenir."
Mines View Observation Deck,The place got cleaned up and has more interesting vendors selling small plants. Get some inexpensive bonsai for 50-150 pesos!
Mines View Observation Deck,Arrive early!
Mines View Observation Deck,Do not go when it's raining. You can't see anything.
Mines View Observation Deck,They implemented a fee. 10 pesos for adults qnd 5 pesos for children.
Mines View Observation Deck,Overly crowded - as in you get multiple strangers in your photos when you take them. The park itself is dirty and the view of the mountain ranges is not breath-taking anymore. Sad to see Mines View Park deteriorate like this.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View is one of the most visited spot in Baguio City because of it's famous observation deck where all people take photos, horses, Ifugao costumes and St. Bernard dogs that you can take photos with, buy souvenirs all over the place, and overlooking restos where you can dine and see the beautiful mountains of Baguio."
Mines View Observation Deck,"The place, now, HAS 10 PESOS ENTRANCE plus the usual facemask, QTP, and vaccination card."
Mines View Observation Deck,It's okay
Mines View Observation Deck,"Still, it has its magnificent view, if only its original green scenery was maintained. The cool breeze is still there especially in the afternoon."
Mines View Observation Deck,Too small for a lot of tourist you cant even appreciate the beautiful view cause more and more people are allowed to go down so you will be force to go back up after taking pictures.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Very popular tourist spot, but picking a weekday especially Wednesday can be very few people or very early Saturday or Sunday very little parking available taxi or jeepney more convenient."
Mines View Observation Deck,Trying the native attires! Cool place!
Mines View Observation Deck,If you're budget wise. You can get here for only 10pesos! Ride a jeepney at the mines view terminal located at Lower Mabini St. (Just check it out on google map) then you can pass thru 2 tourist destinations (botanical garden & wright park). And at the end is the Mines view deck! Enjoy the awesome scenery!
Mines View Observation Deck,The view is amazing but not breathtaking. Schedule your visit during a clear day because when it gets foggy you won't see a thing.
Mines View Observation Deck,I love it. If only the houses in the mountains were not there. That view will be much of perfect and everyone whose loves nature.will enjoy the scenery
Mines View Observation Deck,It was a popular place in baguio..nice view
Mines View Observation Deck,"Nothing really interesting to see from the observatory deck nor from one of the restaurants nearby. The scene is just a plain mountain/ valley with some houses spread across.The town of Itogon, which is visible from the deck, used to be mining site for gold and copper but was abandoned by Benguet Corporation. [rewritten from wikipedia]"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Best view on sunrise. Lots of souvenir stalls. Also, tourists have a chance to dress full cordillera outfit"
Mines View Observation Deck,"The houses overseeing Mines View are astounding, saying that the nature has been abused by commercialization. But anyways it is part of a developing community. Bear with it but the stability of the nature needs to be considered."
Mines View Observation Deck,Still scenic..good view cool and relaxed ambiance.. liked that they had well-trained and behaved horses u could actually pose with.. 😁😁😁
Mines View Observation Deck,Highly improved landscaping of area. Shops are better organised to satisfy most tourist needs.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Nice ppace to literally unwind and sight seing, cold place"
Mines View Observation Deck,"It's a public place to view a part of Baguio City, its mountains and foliage. Best to visit, I think, in early mornings to bask in the sun. I'm a sun-lover, you might already have guessed."
Mines View Observation Deck,One of Baguio's tourist destination.  Great  views and local shopping.  Be careful the area is quite steep. Take plenty of pictures.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Souvenirs, food, Picture taking with a horse with pink hair and also with a St. Bernard dog. 😁 It would be best accompanied with people who has a good presence of mind!"

Mines View Observation Deck,"The Best place for summer, it has so many souvenir and commodities in the are at low cost. thank you Baguio people for very accommodating environment  whenever we ask of direction they politely tell you of honest and exact direction."
Mines View Observation Deck,Veru good view of the mountains full of fogs.
Mines View Observation Deck,"The view is fantastic, but it's always very crowded and plenty of people selling any kind of things. So, at the end I find it not so enjoyable."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Good place to see a peak of the whole Baguio. I love the rented native clothing, ube taho and items for sale everywhere. Easy to get a taxi."
Mines View Observation Deck,😍
Mines View Observation Deck,It's been 11 years since I last visited. Railings have been installed for safety. Everything else is the same. View is still nice.
Mines View Observation Deck,"This place is too crowded. Going here means you have to endure traffic. You just have to see this place ONCE because there's nothing else to see here. Other than that, you can buy succulents or other plants. Wear local costumes, have your photo taken. Have another photo with an overworked saint bernard and leave. After that you can get yourself an overpriced 'taho' (taho is much cheaper in metro manila). This place is a Baguio City landmark btw that's why people go here."
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice view
Mines View Observation Deck,"Baguio in itself has turned until cestpool of traffic. Cars and people everywhere. That still didn't deter us from coming to this tourist hotspot. The walkway leading to the observation point is adorned with vendors selling plants. There is a stall that allows you to dress up like native igorots with cape, hats with the word BAGUIO over your forehead and a sun necklace although you're not allowed to bring the costumes down to the observation deck. I think we just paid 25 pesos. The lower part of the observation deck no longer has begging children that I used to remember back in the days that would brave the dangerous rocks below asking for coins. The view has somewhat been tarnished with homes in the distance and you can barely see the mines itself anymore."
Mines View Observation Deck,It offers a great view for 10 pesos. crowded at all times. you can buy here some Baguio foods and plants.
Mines View Observation Deck,here's to one of the most popular attractions when you go to Baguio. You can't possibly miss this one. The scenery and weather here is breathtaking.

Mines View Observation Deck,Crowded
Mines View Observation Deck,The view restaurant is a good deal vs fighting crowded point. Most shops have the same prices on good but some are a little cheaper than others.
Mines View Observation Deck,"There are now quite a few things to do here but be ready to pay every activity. If you wish to take a photo with the st.bernard dog php50.00, horse picture php50.00, igorot outfit php20.00. View? Okay only."
Mines View Observation Deck,Great view!
Mines View Observation Deck,"Lots of native products, beware of fake bonsai.."
Mines View Observation Deck,Mines View Park is one of the best panoramic spots I've ever seen. This place is best for    landscape and panoramic photographers. Even for the one who is selfie addict :)
Mines View Observation Deck,"This is a top attraction in Baguio.To enjoy the view fully, go here early in the morning to avoid the traffic and the crowd."
Mines View Observation Deck,Okay for first-time visitors.
Mines View Observation Deck,Place was good for sight seeing and it was cold when we visited the area. Bring extra patience as the area particularly the viewing deck can get a little bit crowded
Mines View Observation Deck,A very nice place to view Benguet mountains. Trahbins are properly placed for every area and very organized parking area.
Mines View Observation Deck,It is good and you can see the nice view of Baguio here however we just need to observe cleanliness of the area as some areas has small trash.
Mines View Observation Deck,Grand view of sceneries. Too bad the weather didn't cooperate when we went there. Seems too cramped to handle the number of tourists.
Mines View Observation Deck,Crowded but the street foods are amazing 👌 i like the strawberry and ube flavored taho ❤️ may pay CR but walang toilet so you have to squat but it's clean
Mines View Observation Deck,Cold and an exquisite view of nature.
Mines View Observation Deck,Awesome experience with amazing views across the mountains. A landmark of the Philippines for sure.
Mines View Observation Deck,Over rated look out. Nothing special.during peak periods the traffic is a nightmare. Avoid it. it is a real night mate. Traffic will spoilyour trip.
Mines View Observation Deck,"It's no longer the same old place. If not for the pony ride/photo op plus the rental for the traditional Igorot linen, the place has nothing much to offer."
Mines View Observation Deck,Mines view park in the year 2020 is always the same vibe in an earlier years. One of the landmark of Baguio City that you should include in your itinerary.
Mines View Observation Deck,Good and convenient because of the different stalls and souvenir items.It is advisable to visit during sunny or summer not on rainy season
Mines View Observation Deck,Crowded during weekends. Cool and chill place.
Mines View Observation Deck,This is one Baguio destination that you don't want to miss. Your Baguio tour is not complete without dropping by the Minesview Park and take a selfie at the view deck. This is also where you can buy your favorite souvenir and a few walk will bring you to the Good Shepherd to buy the best Ube (purple sweet potato) & Straberry jams. Parking in this area is really scarce.
Mines View Observation Deck,i've seen much better views from many other view decks all over the philippines. i can't understand why this view deck is the most popular in the country 😏

Mines View Observation Deck,"View of the mountains covered by the fog, perfect weather."
Mines View Observation Deck,nice view... dramatically instagrammable. but i noticed visible garbage in the area especially in the cliff of the mines view itself. lack of trash bin in all places.
Mines View Observation Deck,Went here a week ago. The park is currently undergoing renovation. Many plants were being sold inside which I guess is a boon for tourists and sellers alike.
Mines View Observation Deck,the place is a good spot for an overlooking view of the city.
Mines View Observation Deck,The view is breath taking...the climate also make you feel like that you are out of the country...the strawberry taho and ube taho is a must to try here...also you can buy souvenirs at low cost compare to other places in Baguio...The saint bernard dog also was so cute and a must to picture when you come here...also they have jeepneys that will drop you to other tourist spot near mines view park...
Mines View Observation Deck,Lovely sight of nature at the viewing deck
Mines View Observation Deck,"There are so many vendors now, it is better to go here on a regular day, you wont enjoy it when it is so crowded. Went to baguio last Holy Week, enjoyed it though."

Mines View Observation Deck,"Lovely view, lots of souvenirs"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Crowded place! Observed animals (horse and dog) are being abused especially the dog, placing a shades failed to hid hows the dog feels. Available option will allow you to have a  photoshoot wearing an Igorot attire."
Mines View Observation Deck,"To be honest I found the  dog (the St. Bernard) interesting than the place (only happens when you hiked Mt. Ulap or such tge previous day)Generally, it was ok😁"
Mines View Observation Deck,"Over looking for a nice view, fresh air and cool breeze. One of the most visited places in the city of Baguio."

Mines View Observation Deck,"Wonder view from the deck but guests usually leave their trash on some areas. Please if you visit here, dispose your trash properly. Thanks."
Mines View Observation Deck,Touristy and crowded. The view's not even worth traveling to. There are a lot more picturesque valley landscape views all over the north.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Place to reflect, buy souvenirs and buy plants. Nice place to be when in Baguio."
Mines View Observation Deck,You could get a good view of the mountains but transportation from here to go to your hotel is too much hassle because there are a lot of visitors.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Offers great view of the mining pit and majestic mountains, though it's advisable to go there during off-peak season as it can get very crowded and jampacked"
Mines View Observation Deck,Its just fine...but i think they have to assure that horses should take a bath before the photo shoot with the tourists ..
Mines View Observation Deck,"One of the great tourist attractions in Baguio City is the Mines View Observation Deck. The mountains, the mini village below and the magnificent sunrise, everything are in picturesque perfect."

Mines View Observation Deck,Mines View Park has recently been renovated to offer better facilities so that tourists can better enjoy the nice views of the mountainsides of Baguio City.
Mines View Observation Deck,Still a bice place to catch a breath taking view. Be sure to go on off peak hours to enjoy the scene and be able to take pictures more
Mines View Observation Deck,Please come here early because giant mosquitoes comes out near nighttime
Mines View Observation Deck,Crowded but worth the wait to see the landscape
Mines View Observation Deck,Very nice place where we can shop and unwind!
Mines View Observation Deck,if they had only expanded the viewing area then it would be 5 stars.overall it's still worth the 3 hour drive from manila
Mines View Observation Deck,Take a picture here and dress a tradition costume. There are many things to experience here like eating exotic food and taking a picture beside a saint Bernard dog.
Mines View Observation Deck,Nice tourist spot around the area but the usual crowd volume is a little too much making the place noises which is ironic for a scenic spot.
Mines View Observation Deck,Refereshing and beautiful place ❤️

Mines View Observation Deck,Great view! :-)
Mines View Observation Deck,Never showed any significant difference than our previous  visits
Mines View Observation Deck,So many things to buy from
Mines View Observation Deck,It's one of the places to visit. The view is not bad. It also has a couple of good places to eat there.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Very different from the last time i was here which was 6 or 7 years ago. More or less the same things are being sold but they added more picture opportunities like horses, signs, etc."
Mines View Observation Deck,I went here for the second time and still the same experience but much crowder. It would be best if you visit here early to avoid the too much crowd and the view would be more better in the morning sun.
Mines View Observation Deck,It's a park so there are plenty of people. But the view was just okay. I expected way more than what I experienced/saw.
Mines View Observation Deck,It's  a cool scenic overlook with the customary tourist trinket stalls. If you don't like heights this one is questionable.
Mines View Observation Deck,Wonderful view! Could improve with tourist assistants around to ensure flow of people and safety of kids and the elderly.
Mines View Observation Deck,nice view
Mines View Observation Deck,The view @ Mines View Deck is spectacular and the food and merchandise being sold there is value for you money...
Mines View Observation Deck,"No entrance fee.Ifugao costume for rent = 25php (all sizes, girl or boy).Horse back picture = 50php (3 shots)Corn cob = 3pcs/100phpCR = 5php"
Mines View Observation Deck,Such a breath taking view!!! Cool breeze
Baguio City Market,Philippine bazaar market at its best. I mean when you want a merchandise you have 50 little merchants who want your business. This place is old but its character is pleasing. Every ones very nice. Haggling is encouraged.
Baguio City Market,"Place is clean and well-maintained.With good police visibility, which was good as you feel secured. Vendors are organized and helpful.This is place is nostalgic, nothing much had changed since I last went here years ago."
Baguio City Market,"Always visit the market for vegetables and pasalubong shopping. Bring your own tote bag. Ask around for the best price, you will always find the lowest price towards the middle of the market."
Baguio City Market,"Clean as ever... But you have to be wiser when buying... You have to canvas, haggle price and still check whatever you bought if it's complete, just that you don't have to go back there to pick up what's missing. 😁😀"
Baguio City Market,Mahal na  ang presyo.  Look  at  different  sellers  because  the  difference  in price   go  up  to as much as 100 pesos.  Fruits and veggies  fairly priced. The   sweets and  pasalubongs really differ per stall.Best  buy  are the  yarns! Comes in all colors  and variants  
Baguio City Market,"I visited Baguio Market on weekdays so I am not really sure if its crowded every weekend. Their pasalubongs are all cheap in price. Sweets, walis tambo, tshirts, seafoods and etc. You may choose this place for pasabulongs and souvenir if you dont want to visit the good shepherd since its a bit pricey."
Baguio City Market,"Nice market, very organize and clean esp. on the fruit seller area."
Baguio City Market,"You should never miss the market when visiting Baguio City. Love the coffee, took me almost 1hr! Its clean. Follow the traffic signs, Loading/Unloading road side."
Baguio City Market,Lots of options to see and choose from. Great value for money. This is my favorite market in the country because it's so clean and orderly.
Baguio City Market,"Go to Stall #13 for your walis tambo needs, and Stall #149 for your pasalubong needs. They can give you discounts!As for your Vigan longganisa fix, you can buy it from.manong who sells it at nearby stalls that sell handwoven pasalubongs and flowers.Great place to buy your pasalubongs: Vigan logganisa from Manong. His stall is beside a small flower shop in an alley near the stalls that sell handicrafts and blankets. Get your walis tambo that lasts for years at Stall #13, and your coffee beans from Garcia's."
Baguio City Market,A good place to purchase pasalubong or just simply buying food for your daily needs when staying in Baguio City. The price is very affordable specially the vegetables.
Baguio City Market,"They say that public markets reflects the soul of every town or city and I seem to agree with it. Since my early childhood, I have been going around this place whether to buy fish and meat at the wet market and hire Marvel and DC comics at the souvenir section.The Baguio City market is not exactly the best place that one can go to buy things for the family. Its wet market section is really wet and never dry. Its vegetable section is no longer for veggies only. There is also a missing center park at the market where I used to shine shoes as a child but it is now occupied by stalls where mixed goods are sold. My government job at the Department of Trade and Industry requires me and my colleagues to check on their food items in conjunction with other agencies like the Department of Health and we do on-the-spot inspection.I rate this place 1 star only as it really needs sprucing up. Since the early 80s, the place was gutted with fire and I'm sharing my images here. I'm looking forward to the modernization of this public market."
Baguio City Market,A place to go if you intend to stay in Baguio for a week and save money on food and items.You will find most of what you expect on a Wet & Dry Marketplace. If you are not in the hurry best to check different stalls first for the best price on the same item. Be kind to the vendor it will make the price negotiation a lot smoother.If you are a tourist or foreigner best to hit this  place with a local friend to avoid being overpriced.Overall the Local Gov has done great in monitoring vendors who overprice and handle it. A must check place for souvenirs and treats.
Baguio City Market,"Clean, accessible and cheap prices for veggies, fruits and pasalubong"
Baguio City Market,"Feel neutral about this place. The people are nice and friendly. There may be some chances though that they will add more price to what the product should cost. So I would recommend you to buy from stalls that have their price tags displayed. If you're one of those who are great at bargaining, do it but keep in mind that they are all working hard to make ends meet. 👌"
Baguio City Market,"As a home cook who pretends to chef, a fresh meats, fish and veg market spanning between three and four city blocks is a good way to lose an entire afternoon. As usual with a large open market, the best deals take time and searching."
Baguio City Market,Great to do the shopping..love the place
Baguio City Market,"You'll buy a variety of needs and wants here from veggies to fruits to household items and even preloved clothes and many more! It's a bit cheaper compared to those being sold inside malls.However, don't expect this public market to have tiles and other luxury architecture as it is old and sometimes, when its rainy, you'll meet huge, furry rodents!"
Baguio City Market,Here in Baguio Public Market you can buy product using gcash.
Baguio City Market,"Where you can buy vegetables, coffee, and other goods at low prices"
Baguio City Market,"IMO Baguio wet and dry market could do with an upgrade. The vegetable section is very dark and flooring all over the market is dangerously uneven for more senior customers. Since it's always bumper to bumper traffic in downtown Baguio and parking is at a premium, the city could maybe also consider opening smaller fruit and vegetable open-air markets away from downtown?"
Baguio City Market,"The options of what you can buy are great. The vegetables are cheap, of course, it still depends on whether a storm damaged crops.  The only problem there is the parking."
Baguio City Market,"Great market. If I lived in Baguio I would definitely shop there for meats, veggies and fruits. Also there's plenty of clothing and apparel options."
Baguio City Market,"The market is pretty expansive and beautifully chaotic. The front will house the touristy pasalubong center where you can buy your Ube Jam, Peanut Brittle, Walis and things. At the back of that will be the general merchandise. Further in would be the wet and dry market. Be prepared and walk with comfy shoes, the entire market area would be similar in size with a small baranggay."
Baguio City Market,Local produce for your liking
Baguio City Market,"Still the same Baguio City market that we used to love. If you are driving a car, parking might be a problem. To support the local community, take the public transport instead if you have the time."
Baguio City Market,"This is the ultimate pasalubong center of baguio city. Fruits, sweets, delicacies, decors, food, coffee beans, brooms, handicrafts and so much more. Don't forget to visit when in Baguio. Still the same since the 90's!"
Baguio City Market,"If you plan to buy pasalubong. Go to the public market, you'll get most of them for a cheaper price. The vegetables are also fresher and cheaper here."
Baguio City Market,Cool and very nice to buy all pasalobong from there
Baguio City Market,what i love in this market is the wide selection of local goods and most of it is cheaper. will definitely going back to this place

It extends up to the upper part of the block, where you can see the Wagwagan, or the shops selling cheap second hand clothes and shoes. Great treasure trove for winter clothes for your travels. In the pasalubong (souvenir) area, you can find soooo many stores where you can buy the best Baguio goods to choose from, at the best prices. You can haggle and get the best offers especially if you’re buying bulk. Various items are sold -local delicacies, packed snacks, fruits, vegetables, coffee, and other locally sourced products in the province of Benguet. As in any other public markets, be sure to take care of your belongings and your children."

Baguio City Market,"What i like about this market is the fresh vegetables.  they are fresh and cheaper than the rest of the markets around. Strawberries are also cheap and so are the coffee beans and ground coffee some of which are flavored. Also available in this market are Mountain Maid products like Lengua de Gato and Ube Jam. and if your bags are full and heavy, there are ""extrahands"" who are very willing to carry them to where you are parked."
Baguio City Market,Hope the city government will fix the wet market section and inspect the sewers and elevate the stalls so it's not so dirty and stinky.
Baguio City Market,"Fruit and vegetable market heaven.   Go to the inner stalls along narrow walkways to get lower prices, and avoid the main selling areas.  They also sell low land fruits and dried fish products and native rice cakes from pangasinan.  Check also the grains and beans sections."
Baguio City Market,If only ALL markets we're like this in the Philippines.
Baguio City Market,I visited Baguio Market in June 2022. There was rain in the place so it would be best to bring umbrella to help in shopping for our favorite coffee available in Umali and Garcia. Remember also buy balikutcha to add sweetness to the coffee.
Baguio City Market,Be careful of the loading and unloading areas to avoid traffic violations. Go to the middle part of the market to find the cheap but fresh vegetables (bagsakan). It's just past the Cuevas Bakery and along the stores that sells ground coffee (we bought from Garcia). Best to bring your own ecobags. There are market guys (kargador) who offer to carry your bags for a fee.
Baguio City Market,"A lot of things to buy here but always wear your mask, bring alcohol and your most comfy shoes because you'll be needing it. One of the crowdiest place in Baguio because its a market!"
Baguio City Market,A typical market set-up...but what's unique are the produce only indigenous to Baguio...from fresh strawberries 🍓to the freshest vegetables such as lettuce and sayote tops...from purple yam to strawberry jams...there are also coffee vendors around...there are colorful walis Tambo to Bonnets and cardigans! Everything Baguio is here in this market! Enjoy shopping 💕

Baguio City Market,"A must go to if you are visiting Baguio to buy pasalubong, souvenirs, and fresh produce"
Baguio City Market,"Looking for fresh meat and vegetables? Nothing can be more fresher than the vegetables offered here. They have most of the vegetables available here, some are not even available in some markets in Manila. It's much cheaper to buy from the market and cook it yourself. They also have great selection of fruits and local products like ""kakanin"". With the longganisa vendors, look for those not in the front as those tend to be cheaper. Those in the picture are mostly for tourists. Avoid going here all ""touristy"" so you can haggle for the price or get better deals. If you're looking for liempo, they call it ""ping ping"" here. If you're hungry with all that shopping, they also have some food stalls here where you can buy meals or snacks. Look for those individual vendors on the side of the road to support them and avoid haggling for the price."
Baguio City Market,Fresh vegetables at very reasonable prices. There are also rows of local delicacies like strawberry and ube jams.
Baguio City Market,"A place where you can find Baguio souvenirs in cheaper prices compared to other tourists spots, specially when you planned to buy a lot. You can find everything from wall decors, t-shirts, cordillera customs, keychains as well as fruits,vegetables etc."

Baguio City Market,Where there are delicious fruit!!!Mango sells at 150 pesos a kilo..And a lot of people...!!!I recommend going on weekdays.
Baguio City Market,"Store owners are very nice, probably the best place to buy ""pasalubong"" in Baguio City. It would be best if you go to the public market in the afternoon or after the morning rush."
Baguio City Market,Very organized and easy to get to. Plus it does not have the usual “palengke smell” that’s common in all Philippine public markets. Stalls are spaced out evenly so there is very little chance of it getting cramped in non peak hours (late morning onwards) and it’s also the place where you could get decent cheap coffee. There are 2 main coffee players - Umali and Garcia. I always go to Umali since they have what I like - Sagada Arabica medium roast plus it’s less packed than Garcia. A fun experience overall.
Baguio City Market,"This is one of the very fortunate market in the Philippines which is naturally airconditioned. Hehehehehe.Every time I come to Baguio, I am looking for fresh mushrooms. Of course, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Sayote Tops, Baguio Cabbage, Lettuce and so many vegetables. The price here is cheap. Almost 30% less price than the markets in Manila.There are many souvenir shops too. I enjoy my market here. I hope you enjoy too!"

Baguio City Market,Parking is a problem. So ride a taxi. Prices of vegetables are the same as MM. But fresh. Fish variety is limited. Not too crowded. Maybe because I was there on a Friday.
Baguio City Market,"A short visit to the Baguio City Public Market is a must in order to shop for fresh strawberries & Filipino delicacies. We shopped for things to take with us on our trip to Banaue. That we did once in our 3 nights stay in the City. It was an interesting walk we had around the dry goods area, flowers shops & fruit shops. Prices were reasonable."
Baguio City Market,Nice in the morning when it's not yet too crowded. A lot more organized now than how I remember it as a kid. Best to go early before around 6or7am so that it's not yet too crowded and there's still lots of parking. It's nice to stroll around and look for good finds and the best price.
Baguio City Market,… pasalubong area still clean and organized. Did not have the time to check prices prior to going and later found out that veggies sold in this area are more expensive than those sold in the regular wet market area. The loading and unloading points are strictly enforced and it makes a lot of sense to regulate traffic in this busy area.
Baguio City Market,"Affordable strawberries, P220/kilo. But you have to watch and be vigilant on the items that you are buying esp strawberries. Some ventors might switch your fresh bag to rotten straberries bag."
Baguio City Market,Its fine their is alot of people asking for money. The products are good
Baguio City Market,"It is the best place to stop by before going back home! Our visit here is never complete without buying pasalubongs and vegetables here.

Baguio City Market,Nice place to visit for your daily needs. Fresh fruits and veggies. Fish and meat. Even dry goods are available.
Baguio City Market,I bet this place would be the point of freshness if you wanted to cook something for your significant others. Pure and low cost ingredients for savvy cooking. As what they say if you wanted a good meal cook with a heart  and also never forget a fresh ingredients. Just beware of pick pockets because in any city they where existing. You can bargain from their initial price point but be sure youll buy in bulk or variety of their products.👍#baguio #market #fresh #wheninbaguio #fruits #fish #places #vegetables

Baguio City Market,Cant leave the Philippines without visiting an authentic public market. WE buy most of our vegetables and most of our meats here. The price seems about 20% less then going to the mall. I prefer to get in early as it is difficult to get a taxi after 7am.
Baguio City Market,I liked good thing in Baguio which is buying habits of people from local shops instead of going to a supermarket. It definitely improves local economy and provides number of work opportunities to local people. You name a thing and you can get it in this market.

Baguio City Market,"We were ecstatic to finally explore the City Market. It was cleaner than expected, and the vegetables were so fresh and delicious! Prices were so much cheaper, though you really have to make the uphill trek to get to Hangar and Hilltop, which are cheaper than the market area at street level. But the quality and prices of the veggies are so worth the aching legs."

Baguio City Market,Majority of the stalls are still using manual weighing scale to weigh their products. This type of scale is easily manipulated and buyers are usually cheated with the weight and price. The LGU should implement using digital weighing scales.
Baguio City Market,Organized and per Section Marketplace in the City of Pines
Baguio City Market,City of pines and used to be the honeymooners haven thats during the early 60's and 70's but until now our market hasnt been develop yet. Hoping so much the next administration will focus on this rehabilitation.
Baguio City Market,Be early in buying fruit and veggies here.
Baguio City Market,Where you can buy almost everything you want.
Baguio City Market,It is the cleanness market I have ever been as of now. The prices here are somehow cheap too. My favorite part of the market was the souvenir section where I bought my shirts and other delicacies. The comfort room here is also clean and well organised even though it is not that high class. Another one good thing about it was that I was not lost on my ways its is very accessible and easy to find.
Baguio City Market,Favourite marketplacr
Baguio City Market,"Great selection of a variety of goods whether for mobile phones, kids clothes, toys, honey, health foods, sweets, motor vehicle accessories and souvenirs.Not very well lit but reasonably laid out.Good prices and spending money in here helps the local economy."
Baguio City Market,"The place is clean and organized. The sellers are helpful and courteous. Their vegetables and fruits are fresh. Their jams, preserves and candies are new stocks. You'll find plenty of choices on shirts and other pasalubong items.  All commodities are reasonably priced but you can still get discounts if you ask. A good place to go to when in Baguio. Parking would be a challenge though. Better commute. There are a lot of jeepneys, vans and taxis anyway."
Baguio City Market,"Public market in the heart of Baguio City. People can buy clothes, fresh vegetables, souvenir items and all of Baguio's specialties."
Baguio City Market,"Offers nothing as a public market except the name. Groceries are generally more expensive than supermarkets and most of them of lesser quality. Most vegetables are an overpriced dump for old produce yet at the price of prime quality fresh produce. Most (not all) cheat with weight. A tourist trap par excellence.Most dry goods are repacked with no label, no expiry date, no quality indication of any kind and the majority of merchants refuse to tell you the name of the producer. You simply have to take their word for it. This place is EXTREMELY dirty without the simplest basic hygiene rules. This place should be condemned and shut permanently. The reason it is not may be that local politicians benefit from it being that way."
Baguio City Market,Everything you could want from fruits and vegetables to coffee and t-shirts. I was even able to find my precious dill weed here 🙂👍
Baguio City Market,One of the cleanest markets ever in the Philippines
Baguio City Market,"This market needs a massive development ,not just to be a good appealing to the eye but for the safety and health of everyone visiting this public market...and should be on much organize public market....just my own opinion...."
Baguio City Market,A good place to buy your pasalubong.
Baguio City Market,"The public market has changed a lot. It has become cleaner and spacious as always. You can now be able to buy what you need. If you have a car,better park it in designated areas, or better yet, take a public transportation like taxis and jeepneys.    Souvenir shops and Fresh Benguet Vegies are up for grabs at the first part or frontage of the market and as you go inside, the upper part is already the wet market and the highest part are other varieties of vegie and fruit stalls.  It's pretty wide though so go explore and discover other products that also comes from other neighbouring towns."
Baguio City Market,"All the fruits and vegetables are fresh, even if we came in the afternoon. Very good prices too, but best to haggle because you can get even better prices. I especially loved the lemons that are only p50 for 4 and are plump and very juicy! I could squeeze out almost a glass' worth of lemon from each!"
Baguio City Market,One of Baguio's earliest buildings and landmark. It offers affordable goods! Just a little  bit of lighting needed in the fish and meat section and monthly inspection :)

Baguio City Market,Many products available and cheeper than your market. Specially the rice and the veggies.
Baguio City Market,"I was raised nearby, and nothing much changed since my first walk on this cultural reflection of Baguio. I would love to see some improvement before I die (unlikely), but having clean restrooms and police stations close by is good enough."
Baguio City Market,"There is a big selection of wet and dry products all at very affordable prices. I think that it really does show an appeal in the fact that its a variety of different products instead of just one single category.I was able to buy rice and fruits here on the go without having to experience the hassle of lining up like you would at a grocery and its perfect for those with busy schedules.My only problem would be that there are certain places that most likely need better sanitary practices, especially when selling fresh meat or meat products in general."
Baguio City Market,"Place is too crowded during weekends so best to go there during regular days. If you want to buy vegetables in bulk, best to buy at the wholesale section rather than the main market. It's just a few steps away. You can also buy organic produce there."
Baguio City Market,Drop-off ang pick-up point area provided and monitored by traffic enforcers.
Baguio City Market,Organized and clean as always. They have strawberries and blueberries during February

You can buy different kinds of fresh fruits and vegetables there for an affordable price! If you want to indulge for strawberries and buy some souvenir items, you should visit this market before leaving the city. Moreover, it is cleaner than the other public markets I explored. 😊"
Baguio City Market,"We visited at night in the middle of a storm but we still had fun. There was plenty of variety in the market stalls and we enjoyed looking through the products in search of a bargain and there were plenty of those. It's worth going especially if you are a visitor to Baguio. Take an umbrella if it looks like rain, but there is ample shelter."
Baguio City Market,"Best public market. It's very clean, well laid out, and very organized. It lacks parking space but you don't need to bring a car if you want fresh meat, produce and fruits everyday. The people are very friendly and helpful,  and the market has everything you need and want."
Baguio City Market,Not the cleanest market in the philippines but all you need frok food to your household supplies and all..it is all here..😊
Baguio City Market,"easy to locate it's in the center of the city proper, it's very clean, and accessible to transportation and very organized too"

The market is zoned from wet (poultry and fish products) from fresh vegetables, to  clothings , souvenirs, fruits , currency exchange, small groceries to bakeries. It has designated parking lot but you may need to consider other options as it may always be full in busy days. And please bring Eco bags if you don’t want to spend on them. Plastics are banned from vendors except the wet market."
Baguio City Market,so many great finds. don't hesitate to go deeper to get to the stalls where locals go. there's a section where you can buy your usual Baguio vegetables at a much lower cost. don't forget to haggle. you know you're there when you could smell the coffee beans being sold by Umali and Rivera.
Baguio City Market,A very organized market really. Head in the inner market where you can find good coffee. Walk down from the meat section to the dry goods and tourist souvenir section. Its not easy to get a taxi here though on a busy sunday afternoon. Be sure to time your visit
Baguio City Market,The place is neat compared to other markets you'll ever visit publicly but at the same time its much expensive since there are a lot of tourist.
Baguio City Market,Great despite the traffic due to the influx of unruly visitors

Baguio City Market,The public market needs rennovation.  I hope the local government could improve this.  Nice items to find!
Baguio City Market,"It is cleaner than most markets here in the Philippines. The sales lady are honest, a little too honest actually. I was about to buy a jar of peanuts but the sales lady informed me that it was hollow in the middle and better to buy a different product. This also happened to my friend and we asked the ladies why they would sell it if they're hollow, and she told us since they're not the store owners, they couldn't remove the products.The bags, souvenirs and the food are all affordable. The people are friendly, the place is clean. This place is a must-see for any tourist."
Baguio City Market,"At good place to buy fruits, vegetables, souvenirs, and other Baguio products at a good price. You just need to bargain most of the time because most will over-markup when they notice you're not a local. Best to ask prices at different stores before purchasing."
Baguio City Market,It's rainy days and it's wet all around Baguio city  as its almost raining everyday.
Baguio City Market,"A very well organized public market.  The place is neatly divided into sections with similar food items, souvenirs and other items for sale all together, making shopping comparison very convenient.  In one section all types of rice are sold, in another, flowers of different kinds, further along the stretch are fruits such as strawberries, different nuts, and desserts are available.   Brooms, hats, and souvenirs in another section.  The meat section is at the back.Parking is not available though, but the mall across offers paid parking though if full, you have limited options.  Best to go with a driver if you have a car or take a taxi or public transport heading here.You'll definitely find a lot of items worth buying from here so bring a huge bag."
Baguio City Market,"Best place to buy your souvenirs, veggies (past the rice stands), and coffee beans (Garcia's)"
Baguio City Market,"If you haven't got time to visit Good Shepherd, you may want to check out stalls here. I found a stall here that sells Good Shepherd's products at wholesale prices. Fresh vegetables and coffee grounds made from Benguet and other specialty coffees are available here."
Baguio City Market,"The market is organized according to products. You can inquire and easily locate goods you need to buy. Just beware of pickpockets most especially during holidays and peak seasons when many tourists are there to buy. Costs of vegetables are so affordable while fruits and goods for pasalubong are a little pricey. Definitely, you will enjoy strolling around the market."
Baguio City Market,"Locals are accommodating, fresh vegetables are all over the place. It is a market so you should expect that it is a market with all the husle and bustle. Clean comfort rooms are also available which is a good highlight compared to other markets."
Baguio City Market,If you want a fresh and affordable vegetables and fruits this is a good market but take note you can only buy good for 1week or 2 weeks for your consumption only coze they don't sell individual or per kilo is just only buy 1bag for every vegetable but if you a reseller this is good for you it so affordable.

Baguio City Market,Nice place. Plenty of choices for gifts or presents like handicrafts and local produce.
Baguio City Market,"Not so tidy unlike other public markets in the places that I had been visited. Some vegetable prices were not so expensive, some prices were just the same with Metro Manila's.  You can also buy second hand shoes,  jackets,  winter coats in a very low prices...."
Baguio City Market,"A very lovely and unforgetable experience here.. Everything is is very cheap to buy, so better try to go in baguio to experience this fabulous place"
Baguio City Market,Cheap local food available. The Umali Coffee is heaven for coffee lovers like me.
Baguio City Market,Cheap fresh veggies and fruits!
Baguio City Market,"Almost wheelchair accessibleThe cab driver brought us to the back of the market, near the police outpost. The entrance there was wheelchair-friendly. The only problem was that there was an open canal and it was in the fish and seafood section of the market. The smell was not very pleasant.The main passageway of the market was wide, the floor was level. It was comfortable to push a wheelchair along even when there were a lotnof weekend shoppers.The only problem was when we tried to get a cab in front of the public market. There was no ramp! Luckily, the driver was ingenious. He parked the cab right next to the curb and it was a bit easier to board the cab from the curb."
Baguio City Market,As far as markets go this place awesome. There may be repeats of items but you can haggle with shopkeepers for better prices. In addition some shops exchange foreign money which often has better rates than people can find in their origin country (better than Vancouvers rate)
Baguio City Market,"Place where you can buy souvenirs, fruits, vegetables, goodies, from Baguio"
Baguio City Market,"Don't get wet at the seafood section, your clothes will smell like fish for days."
Baguio City Market,The market is clean and nice
Baguio City Market,"Well...some parts of the market are nice,but when i pass by the place where you buy meat and fish something like that, and suddenly the smell there sometimes it is mixed with i dont know and sometimes you smell the scent of the fish...but overall its nice to buy the fresh products over there.."
Baguio City Market,"Baguio public market has always been a very exciting place for me. You can buy all the things that you need for a cheaper price  as long as you know where to look.So if you want cheaper goods than in the grocery store don't be afraid to walk around the market.  Go to all the nook and cranny, up and down( co'z we are on the mountain) and you might find what you need and have a good exercise to."
Baguio City Market,"What a fun place.  Full of great food stalls of veggies  chicken, pork, fish anx a little beef.  The meat stalls are quite interesting and eye opening.  If going to buy meat, best go early in the morning since a lot of meat sellers do not use ice.  The sellers are very accomodating and will do special cuts if asked. Also, great place for norhtern Philippine souvenirs.  Truly enjoy the ambiance of the place.  If you like strawberry jam, buy the local one.  It's excellent."
Baguio City Market,Well organized and complete. Very recommended for all ages.ill give 4 star only due to price issue. Fruits are a little bit pricey as compared to manila with the exception of strawberry and apple.
Baguio City Market,Because it was nice to have trip and bonding with family and also this is were I Live and this is my city
Baguio City Market,"One place to buy all the pasalubong, vegetables, accessories and many more. Try not to look like a tourist and haggle on prices to make the most bang for your buck. Parking spot is difficult, suggest to try the nearby mall or the burnham park and walk your way from there.wallets, cellphones, bags and valuables should be in your front pockets since snatchers/thieves are walking around looking for unwary tourist during the busy day. Overall, place is safe just look after your belongings."
Baguio City Market,There are all sorts of things from paintings to souvenirs. But god! The strawberries here are more costly than in gov. Prk rd.
Baguio City Market,"Although this is where you can find the cheapest and the freshest meats in town, the market was forgotten to be developed to be in tuned to the present needs of the General populace. The city market has been this way since the 80s and so does its drainage and sewer system... Making the wet area really wet! So if you are planning to do your marketing here, be ready to smell the stench and your shoes be splattered with water specially if venturing the fish 🐠 section."
Baguio City Market,We can find good product cheap price
Baguio City Market,One of the fee public market in the Philippines that is noticeable for its cleanliness and orderliness
Baguio City Market,Smells galore! And I don't mean pleasant ones. The smell of fresh meat and rotting meat plus other unknown smells had mixed. So you can imagine. Thankfully after the pandemic they started cleaning the place. But smells are still present
Baguio City Market,"Ahh yes! A very wide and convenient market to visit. They have a lot of items to sell, especially souvenirs for the tourists. I recommend this market to be visited by new tourists to see a variety of items to bring home with them. Cheap items but a bang for the buck!"
Baguio City Market,Nice and friendly sellers however you must be aware of pickpocketers or potential robbers. its a crowded place so be cautious with bacteria.There is a famous coffee shop there. Coffee is sold roasted and must register with a waiting list at the site.
Baguio City Market,"For tourists, if you're planning on buying fruits or vegetables before heading home then this is the place to go. I'd juat advice you guys to but early in the morning. The public market is open as early as 4 or 5 am. That way you'll get better chances of getting an affordable price for the vegetables you plan to buy.Also, there's less crowd and jam in the morning. And newly harvested vegetables are being dropped every morning so you'll be sure everything you buy is fresh. 😉 Explore. Enjoy!"
Baguio City Market,Getting around is difficult and may take you time especially if you're looking for coffee (freshly ground). The go to place if stocks run out at Good Shepherd though expect it to be more expensive as they're not direct suppliers
Baguio City Market,"Loved the place. It was organized and you can buy pasalubongs ranging from sweet goodies (i.e. Lengua de Gato, Ube & Strawberry Jam, Peanut Brittle) to knitted handbags and purses and other utensils and souvenirs made from wood.I bought fresh strawberries at 50 pesos each wrap as well as fresh native grapes (with seeds) at 140 pesos per kilo.The sellers are accomodating and hospitable.No foul smell unlike other wet & dry market."
Baguio City Market,The market is full of souvenir vendors. If you want quality but cheaper in price you can go to the most end of the market vendors who offer cheap prices located in there. Those vendors are just right in front of strawberry vendors and along with vegetable vendors. Use your tawad strategies to get your target price. Enjoy shopping!
Baguio City Market,"Has improved over the past years. It's as clean as some city wet markets get to be. Fair and best prices for vegetables, meats, fruits, groceries, pasalubong, and other household needs."
Baguio City Market,"I like this market because the cleanliness and well organized. The market is located at the heart of the city you can find all the delicacies from coffee, ube jam and many cordillera's specials. Don't to drop by here.People and vendors are kind, and very hospitable.Definetly a place for summer vacation."
Baguio City Market,"The place to be when you're after fresh but cheap produce, food, fruits and pasalubong. We usually buy our coffee beans here since there are a few shops selling it. Its basically a local market that has more to offer."
Baguio City Market,Best place to buy stuffs .. Pasalubong and fresh veggies and fruits..Trip to baguio won't be complete without visiting this place
Baguio City Market,"I really appreciate how the market has improved! Wide roads finally and you can walk around the market, check the items on sale and still want to keep going around.. you can easily find where to buy your products as well because of the constantly improving zoning organisation of products so meats are not intermixed with RTW and dry goods! What more? Parking spaces even if it is limited... Excellent!"
Baguio City Market,"The market has a wide range of ingredients and fresh meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables, you can also get some souvenirs here but yet this place does have some downfalls. First is the smell of the place which smells like a butcher's shop and also one of the downfalls is crowded stalls and paths like sometimes a crowd of people blocks the paths so you have to wait or try to walkthrough them but even with these downfalls it does give you the liberty to choose what to buy and a safe tip from me is to make sure you secure your wallet. Trust me the worst time to realise that your wallet is missing is when you're about to pay for something."
Baguio City Market,"They have everything here! So much selection of vegetables and fruits, beans, rice, peanuts, snacks. I'm a foreigner and I'm vegan, but I could easily do all my shipping here is I was local!"
Baguio City Market,"You'll be expecting fresh goods at cheap prices. However, my tip is that you should go around other stalls before purchasing.  You might get the same item for a lower price on the farther end of the market."
Baguio City Market,The people follow the rules properly and the general area is clean. Some areas are hard to maneuver in for big people like me.
Baguio City Market,"Kind of crowded with all the less strict quarantine rules and people coming out. However, it's abit cleaner than pre-pandemic."
Baguio City Market,Mind your bags or purse when shopping. Wearing dark and waterproof footwear is recommended especially when going to the meat/seafood sections. Learn how to haggle prices since some goods may be given overpriced for foreigners.
Baguio City Market,"Went here last Monday. I got dissapointed that they didn't have good quality veggies. some of the broccoli had brown spots :(  we were thinking it was because of the bad weather.Pros are haggling is expected, so more tawad, more fun! :)Market is also clean. It's accessible from the Victory Liner terminal. Make sure you walk going here if you were dropped off from the terminal since there is a lot of places to see by walking :) there is also a lot of traffic so it's better to walk."
Baguio City Market,"They have a dirty,nasty public market here.Rats can be seen almost all over the place.They are not afraid of people at all. It’s also very crowded here. You barely can park your vehicle here. We just walk to go here.But the vegetables and fruits here are quite fresh.I’m not sure about the meats."
Baguio City Market,"When you want to shop for veggies and fruits and giveaways without the hassle of moving from 1 place to another, its all here. But just beware of shop owners how switch old fruits when you purchase. Enjoy shopping.☝️"
Baguio City Market,"This place is both great for touring and buying cheap products.Look for the ""bagsakan"" of vegetable area. It is near the place where ground coffee is being bought.  Vegetables here are much cheaper than those at the market center.Also look for the kakanin section."
Baguio City Market,"Much improved after the city government's efforts to clean it up and provide better facilities for vendors. Packed with determination and a skill to haggle, one can find almost anything within the market, from food to dry goods for decent prices."
Baguio City Market,Must go there early morning to avoid the crowds
Baguio City Market,Still the same market lots of things to buy
Baguio City Market,Addfordable price for pasalubong and stuff
Baguio City Market,Passed here everyday after work.. enjoyed buying home essentials and fresh vegies... not forgetting meats as well.
Baguio City Market,"Offers a wide range of choices. Best place to but souvenirs, not the cheapest but it is very convenient and accessible."
Baguio City Market,Market is divide into different categories. Very clean.
Baguio City Market,There are lots of fruits and vegetables to choose from but the prices are still expensive except for the onion and garlic.
Baguio City Market,Careful about the vendors. Others were really taking advantage about pricing and watch out for the weighing scale. They're hiding it from the buyers and the box is also part of being weighed in when you purchase some fruits.
Baguio City Market,Wanna bring some pasalubong??? This place is good for you.
Baguio City Market,"A great place for buying vegetables and pasalubong. People are friendly and willing to haggle/give discounts. They are also very helpful so long as you don’t be rude.Beware of pickpockets.Also, bring an ecobag as plastic bags are no longer provided unless you are buying meat but the plastic used will be thin. If you don’t have an ecobag you can buy from the shops or from the children selling them on the streets."
Baguio City Market,If you neednsome food or clothes then this is perfect you can find a huge variety of foods from vegtables to meat to bread at such cheap prices. Its easy to navigate and really a larg place inside huge choices of things to buy even clothes great location to as the jeepney terminal is located right outside or if younprefer a taxinhead along to the taxi bay to get one but sometimes there can be long waits depending on the time of day. Thers rows of sellers so many choices but some amazing bargins to be had. Was a great expirence for me and my wife. During our visit we visited here to buy our food always great.
Baguio City Market,Same good ol' place. Very friendly sellers.
Baguio City Market,"Despite being a public market, the environs are clean. You have a large collection of sellers that offer you different local produce, enabling you to canvas for the best price.If lining up at Good Shepherd is too taxing for you, stalls here sell the same products at very low mark ups.Parking is a challenge however."
Baguio City Market,"It's a big market where there is a segregation of meat, Fish, vegetables, Pasalubong, and ukay. Getting around is quite easy but this market is very busy and also there are some uphill portions so you really have to prepare for it. If your a tourist wanting to buy pasalubong or vegetables, there is a specific section for that, just ask and you shall know where (don't worry that area is relatively flat)"
Baguio City Market,for the tourists: Better to commute when going to the public market because parking space is a problem for those with vehicles. And better to do your marketing in the morning so you won't have problems in getting rides going back to your lodging places.
Baguio City Market,"Buy the freshest produce from La Trinidad and nearby towns at the Baguio City Public Market. It's the heart of the Cordilleras and the best souvenirs, food, veggies, meat and meat products plus used clothing. Be early or buy after office hours to get the freshest produce."
Baguio City Market,"I would say everything you need Pasalubong (present) like different delicacies, stuff souvenirs from north of luzon they have it there. Plus different kinds of fruits, vegetables and so meats and not so expensive compare in manila rates👍👍"
Baguio City Market,"The public market offers a lot of things at a very reasonable price. There are a lot of products being offered there, as a tourist I went directly to the area that sells pasalubong goods. There are different foods to be taken back home for pasalubong, there are stalls that also sells shirts, magnets, key chains, items being carved from wood and a lot more. Just be careful about your belongings, be mindful of your things especially your wallet, in fact there was a big signage that says be mindful of your things. You can haggle the store owners especially if you're buying by bulk. It was a nice place to do your shopping. Very affordable, you can get seven small containers of cookies for just 100php, that's just $2! Friendly people and very persuasive at times haha."
Baguio City Market,"Well maintained,clean,and orderly.a must see tourist spot where u can buy almost all mountain province products cheaper than in the lowlands.be wary of stalls selling the delicious baguio longanisa.i only know 3 stalls out of maybe 30 that sells the real ones."
Baguio City Market,"i been there.  this feb2 2019.  all i can say is, its clean,its organized, all fresh and quality, in all its good.  even the. vendors are easy to deal with, its just.  although vegetable are abundant and close to farm. the prices. is little bit. expensive.Try.to compare them  for those vendors located along hi way its a little bit pricy..  but its a good experience  well have it a try come to bagio.   its worth the travel."
Baguio City Market,"I have been going to Baguio many years and have noticed that the vendors have become rude. Last time I asked the lady to pack my stuff in 2 bags because 1 kilo of any vegetable is too much for one person.  She dumped all my stuff out, sat down and ate and completely ignored me. The other day I asked for a price and when I did not buy, she thanked me for disturbing her lunch. There is also a continuous harassment of may I carry your bags for you despite the fact that you clearly have someone you already hired.  Even the parking lot attendant was rude.  Its like its too much to answer a question and she just kept on gesturing with her hand while her mouth was covered with the ugliest mask!!!!"
Baguio City Market,I like the neutral and moderate flow of the people with the cold climate...
Baguio City Market,"This is really the place to buy your pasalubong, except Good shepherd products. Especially 439 stall. The staff is very welcoming and they give big discounts depending on your purchase."
Baguio City Market,Great place for authentic crafts and other souvenir. Be very very careful as pick pockets are everywhere and always look for tourists. They usually work in groups and they observe you constantly whilst in the markets
Baguio City Market,"If you want to find souvenirs and everything that Baguio has to offer it is the place to be!  From snacks, Vagies, fruits, dry and wet goods to clothing they got it all there! The prices are also not that bad."
Baguio City Market,"Here in public market. You could buy anything you need...in the hill top area, you could buy some wholesale price of goods their. To name a few, clothes and vegetables.  For me its better to buy foods since its more cheaper than buying it in malls. But if you go to fish or meat area, the floor is sleepery..just be careful.."
Baguio City Market,Big market... I didn’t able to stroll the whole place because it was raining hard when we were there and the vegetables are very expensive at that time.Though I was able to buy broomstick for only P100 and cheap pasalubongs. Cheaper price compared with other tourist spots.
Baguio City Market,"Baguio market has different divisions/sections and you really need to explore to find better quality and/or prices for products. As much as possible, wear protective footwear. I see a lot of people in sandals or slippers loudly complaining after stepping on to puddle while at the market."
Baguio City Market,One of the cleanest wet market I had been filled with great shops with great finds. Vendors are all friendly and honest. Produce are really fresh and the souvenirs are classic.
Baguio City Market,"Amazingly cheap ingredients that are usually guaranteed to be fresh. If you're in baguio, this is the place to go if you intend to cook by yourself. The layout of the area may be a bit confusing to first timers in the area, so I strongly recommend having someone familiar with the place give tips on where to look for your needs. This will also mitigate any vendors charging you more than necessary. Pickpockets are an infamous occurrence so ideally, dressing simply and comfortably while being careful is the best way to be ready."
Baguio City Market,"The place is always full of people. Despite this, it is clean and safe. Additionally, it is green and colorful. This is becuase of the variety of vegetables, fruits and ""pasalubong"" that are displayed for sale at every corner.Every store attendant is welcoming, beaming with sweet smile. They too are accomodating and listen to their customer's bargain."
Baguio City Market,"Doesn't matter if it is raining in Baguio City wet and dry market you will be undercover all your stay. Good prices and load of stuff.. Totaly worth a look, clothing bags accessories food and cold drinks no far from jeepney carpark and the city main street. Check it out 😉"
Baguio City Market,"The place is clean and you can buy lots of stuff at a cheap price. You just need to know where to look. You can buy pasalubong from the stores outside or you can go deeper and look for cheaper prices. If you're hungry, there's a carenderia-type food court at the 2nd level of a building in the back."
Baguio City Market,Could be cleaner.Busy as always. No noticeable changes for the longest time. Hoping to see what upgrades the government will implement in the coming years.
Baguio City Market,"It has a diverse variety of items, from pampasalubong (souvenirs) such as ube jam, choco flakes, peanut brittle, butter oats, etc., to fruits, rice delicacies, clothes and px goods. Better go during the morning so as to avoid crowds. Knowing the local language can help you haggle with a good price. Place is relatively cleaner and spacious than other public market that I know."
Baguio City Market,Busy Agora. Many building and fire hazards.
Baguio City Market,"Best place to buy food. Get free vegetables , possibly meat if you know your way around. You can haggle price conduct business sellers are honest.Busy place though have pick pockets and crooks though."
Baguio City Market,Typical marketplace with loads of things to buy and choose from. Be careful of some opportunistic stall owners that overprices their goods for tourist. Otherwise a really huge market that offers pretty much all your daily needs and more.
Baguio City Market,"Nice place... but if you are a tourist and don't have a guide, i suggest don't go anywhere inside the market you might not know what inside the market.. just stick to what other tourist had went through. I also suggest keep your things or valuable things in safe. You might loss your things while enjoying your visiting."
Baguio City Market,Traffic and a bit hot...
Baguio City Market,"A visit to Baguio is not complete without a trip to the marketplace for their longganisas  of different varieties and an array of fresh fruits and veggies and of course the cheap edible pasalubongs. Some go to the bigger market for cool weather clothes, sweaters, cardigans and all kinds of knitted wool caps"
Baguio City Market,"There is everything you want, good prices, clean, no crowding"
Baguio City Market,"The place where most people get their supplies of wet and dry goods. The meat section can be stinky at times but the city does its best to keep it clean. Currency exchange is near the tourist market. Don't be afraid to haggle for a lower price or for more goods, most sellers give way. Just like any market, beware of pick pockets."
Baguio City Market,"We went here for our last minute shopping and we've decided to come early in the morning to avoid the crowd. It was a good decision because by the time we were finished, it was already swarming with people. Great place to buy your pasalubong like peanut brittles and ube jams, prices are cheaper as compared to shops outside. For vegetables, we went to the hilltop portion of the market where fresh and newly-harvest produce were sold cheaper. From cauliflower to broccoli, lettuce and young corn, cabbage and celery, they all have it here. For a few bucks, we got a bagful of fresh veggies!"
Baguio City Market,"They strictly implement the no plastic bag policy so if you plan on shopping here, better bring your own eco bag or basket. You can buy one from the area but it may cost you 10-20 pesos each."
Baguio City Market,Clean and not too crowded when I went there... Veggies and fruits are fresh...
Baguio City Market,"You have to know where to shop to find the best deals, freshest, best quality from the multitude of choices. I am resident so I feel proud of our market (dirt and smell and all) because no other market around the country compares to it"
Baguio City Market,"It is relatively bigger than other city markets in nearby provinces. Price doesn't cost an arm and a leg compared to other marketplaces. Though, the wet section isn't a place for people who are squeamish and  sensitive to odour. Can't haggle. Vendors will just lessen the amount for a peso or two even if you speak the dialect. They only accept cash. No QR codes, no cc nor dc. Taxi service isn't that rampant not even Grab especially during rush hours. Last is, you know the drill, don't bring your valuables."
Baguio City Market,Clean and organize. Clients are satisfied in buying goods for everybody. God bless to all vendors and consumers.
Baguio City Market,"Still love this clean market.  Everything is here besides brooms and strawberry jams. Surprised to find Cebu Style Lechon. The coffee at the far end has good selections,  I never fail to buy Benguet Blend everytime I'm here."
Baguio City Market,"Vegetables are fresh and high quality. Shitake mushrooms 5usd/k lettuce 4usd/k broccoli 3usd Sagada seedless oranges 2usd/k Arabica coffee 5usd/k. The market is clean with guaranteed accurate weighing scale. I will keep on coming back here. Baguio blankets, sweaters and sweets are also recommended."
Baguio City Market,One of the better and cleaner markets in comparison to other cities. There are some annoying beggars and street kids running around that never leave you alone that can ruin the experience. Always bargain never pay the first price they give you.
Baguio City Market,One stop shopping for your babies
Baguio City Market,"The public market is spacious and clean comparable to other Philippine markets. The market has clearly defined sections for fruits and veggies, souvenirs, Baguio food products, etc. I find my favorite Mickies Chili garlic and Romana's Peanut Brittle here."
Baguio City Market,"Age old place to buy all the things one needs to survive and thrive in this congested city. High time that the city improves on this facility. Parking and right of way, whether pedestrian or vehicle is terrible. Transport terminals non-existent. Free for all place."
Baguio City Market,Best to buy coffee and vegetables
Baguio City Market,"Love it.. it's a huge market.. ok to get lost, even if you're foreigner. Just be mindful of your valuables. That's just common sense. The market has only 2 main roads that intersect. The place is organized, but can be overwhelming for a visitor. Section for meat, poultry, live poultry, fish, low land veg, mountain veg, local handicraft, knitwear, money changers, imported goods, 2nd hand clothes,  tailors, rice, coffee, coconut, banana section ...there is also a ""touristy"" section of the market where import fruits, strawberries, souvenirs and more expensive vegetables are sold."
Baguio City Market,"A city market established on a hill, the only one in the north or maybe the entire country. Go to place for all affordable vegetables, fruits, poultry, beef, pork fish and others. Sellers are great and scales are accurate. The best part is you can bargain with the price. Their is also a bunch of ""ukay-ukay"" to choose from. When you visit Baguio go and experience the city market."
Baguio City Market,No vendors on side streets makes space more wider.
Baguio City Market,Fresh veggies but prices are not good. It's like they price differently for tourists.
Baguio City Market,"There aren't any standards practiced here. No butchery standards, cleanliness standards, packaging standards or any other type of standards. That being said, you can get pretty much anything you need at the lowest prices in town. Pork, chicken, beef, fish, bread, pastries, condiments, honey, jams, baskets, wood carvings and bowls, cooking utensils, rugs, blankets, clothes, and a whole lot more."
Baguio City Market,It's a place to buy all your kitchen needs at a market price (which is cheaper than the mall).. It's very near Maharlika where you can buy  souvenirs and gifts made by locals.
Baguio City Market,"Got everything you need for groceries for cheap price. Not so clean because it's a public market. Smells bad overall. But if you want wholesale groceries, this is the place for you."
Baguio City Market,"You can buy cheap souvenir items in here for a very cheap costs compared to those in Burnham park. Strawberries and vegetables are far cheaper here than buying elsewhere. You can also shop regular commodities and meats if you're trying to save. You can also buy longganisang vigan, or longganisang laoag here as well as well as benguet/baguio coffee beans."
Baguio City Market,So much fun in the market.
Baguio City Market,Definitely the place to go when you're looking for fresh produce for your homestays or for souvenirs when you're about to go back. It's quite near the terminals and Session Road so it's quite easy to spot. The place is very organized as well.
Baguio City Market,"Haggling is the key. Prices are a bit tourist-y.Update: same old, same old."
Baguio City Market,"This market is one of my favorite market... because of the fresh vegetables and fresh fruits from the mountains, certainly, a must go place in Baguio City! Don't go home without trying their strawberries! ^_^"
Baguio City Market,"Very clean and organized place. The market is clearly divided into the classes of products sold. They got fruits, vegetables, products made from rattan, and other local resources. It has a wide hall in the center so it wont be crowded despite the tourists going to baguio. It is well-lighted. It has both dry and wet goods. The parking is the only problem though, you really need to find a good spot. If you cannot, you can park in SM Baguio and walk to the market since it is a downhill. Going back to the mall with your goods uphill is hard. There are youth who will help for a small fee. For us, we let two of them carry 50 pieces of walis tambo. We paid them 120.00. Please be there early to get the good stuff - fresh and new plus, less people im the morning. :)"
Baguio City Market,"Vegetables and Fruits are affordable, expected when its near or the actual source of the product. Has a lot of selection of good ukay ukay(second hand) items that you can find for as low as 20 pesos. As a tip when shopping for Ukay ukay items, don't just settle to one store and buy immediately, try to canvas first from one store to another until you find what's best, for the best price."
Baguio City Market,"It maybe a bit different to others since they have more organized market place daw. But for me growing up here, its way better. You know where is the wet market and the dry ones. Our market even offer the bulks of purchase youll never see -lowland and mountain vegetables. Ohh woow.. For variety of fish, you still can find them since La Union and Pangasinan traders are not to far to get in us. So the nexttime you drop by our market. Go around. You will see where u can buy the cheapest at its best-the market is just small and just a little patience is all you need."
Baguio City Market,"Very interesting, so much to offer shoppers and visitors. It feels like a color explosion with vibrant shades of veggies, fruits and cured fresh sausage varieties."
Baguio City Market,A place where you can buy different kinds of fruits and veggies at very affordable cost. Fruits ang veggies are really fresh from the farm. When youre in Baguio dont forget to visit their market.

Baguio City Market,"Great place to find meat, produce, and Pasalubong."
Baguio City Market,"I lost my wallet somewhere in hilltop market. Those people who are selling any goods just for 20.00 are our suspect. I have my small backpack and my companion is trying to buy onions and tomatoes. At that time, i wear my bag on my back,not realizing the possibulilility of losing my things. Everytime i tried to assist,  the vendors says that its okey. Suspicious because it seems that they dont want me to move. And suddenly hurriedly trying to get out of our sight even if we did not choose on the tomatoes and just randomly provided one and left our sight.After 5 minutes,  when we visited a super market,  i just saw that my bag is open and my wallet is missing. I felt relieved for a second thought since my phone is underneath. But the nervousness is still there since i dont have any penny left and i  plan on attending a wedding. Unfortunately, my birthday is coming up to. And i just withdrawed everything in one go, thinking of the inconvenience of going back to the bank.Everytime i see somoene selling something for 20.00, i always get suspicious. Too bad experience."

Baguio City Market,Clean public market. However veggies are same price with Balintawak market if you dont know the price range youll buy there. Plus you'll bear the agony of lifting heavy veggies when you return to Manila.La Trinidad veggie market pricing is better. Though what I like in Baguio public market is their puto Calasiao and longanisa. YUM!!
Baguio City Market,It's a nice public market but it's a bit crowded during the holidays even though it is very large. You have to watch out for pickpocketer here as they love to prey on tourists.

Baguio Night Market,"Baguio Night Market is one of the best and unforgettable experiences. You have to be earlier before 9pm, that's the exciting part! cause you will see how they organize the apparel and a lot more.   You can buy a lot of branded jackets, sweatshirts and more at a cheaper price plus discounts if you know how to ask. After shopping there is a wide selection of food and drinks just a few steps beside the market. Never missed this experience if you visit Baguio City 😊"
Baguio Night Market,"They have a lot of stuff they are selling from thrift clothes down to phone cases and a lot more. As for the food, a lot to choice from like corn, barbecue,takoyaki and many more. There were a lot of people when i went there too. But it is fun to look around, buy some stuff and eat."
Baguio Night Market,"We had to wait until 9pm before the sale started proper. So amazing how all the sellers were so prepared 30 minutes to the start of the market time. The long line of people patiently waiting for both time and their turn. The security guards at the exit gate were so friendly even to remind us that we can't eat outside the market, offered us seat and entertained my friends and I with a lot of international topics. It was really great and fun being there again."
Baguio Night Market,"They started at exactly 9pm and was able to set up quickly. Although it was raining, the store continued. They put covers showing they were prepared. The local police were present but of course, you still have to take care of your belongings.PS. Photos taken using film cam"
Baguio Night Market,Baguio trip is not complete if you have not experienced the food trip and a little shopping at Baguio Night Market. Family and friends will surely enjoy the cold air outside while eating lots of food variety. Most of the ukay items here are cheaper and are good finds ❤️
Baguio Night Market,"Clean and orderly with health protocol reminders in place. Nice place to stroll around to see local market finds but it's disappointing how common souvenir goods' prices are seemingly overpriced (Good Shepherd ube jam was 20 pesos or more cheaper at Mines View Park than here). Convenient to buy though with its central location, but just be aware of potential tourist traps."
Baguio Night Market,"The market gets really crowded in the early hours of its opening but gets less people as it approaches 12 MN. Suggest you come late if you really intend to buy things, but the things sold in the night market can be bought naman outside of it during the day just explore other the shops at Baguio's public market. Only thing I enjoyed is the food bazaar."
Baguio Night Market,prices of commodities are almost the same as of those in thrift shops in provinces. the place is very crowded at night and since it is near the burnham park you could see lots of people strolling at night. tourists need to be careful of their personal belongings
Baguio Night Market,"This is an interesting sales venue/event. We got there at about 8:45. The sidewalks were packed and the vendors were ready with their goods on the side of the street. At 8:55, they all extended the poles on their portable shelters. At 9pm sharp, game on. Vendors rushed to erect their shelters and set up their wares with impressive efficiency. Within just a few minutes,  the shopping looked like a feeding frenzy on Shark Week. It is crazy how this can go from a busy street with heavy traffic to a busy shopping area with people elbow to elbow, all in just about 5 minutes."
Baguio Night Market,"Lots of choices to buy from clothes, jackets, souvenir items, shoes and more. Enforcement of one-way policy can be improved as well as police visibility so as to avoid snatchers."
Baguio Night Market,"Sellers will begin setting up at at 7pm or 8pm but they will only start selling at 9PM. Food selections include favorite Filipino food such as Sisig, Pares, grilled and fried meat, corn, Balut, Kwek-Kwek, and many more. There are also sellers of Takoyaki, Shawarma, Korean Street Food such as Tteokbokki and more.On another side of the night market are stores for favorite Baguio souvenirs such as keychains, magnets, shirts, jackets, knitted sweaters and scarfs by locals, and other things to buy. Some items are pricier than in other souvenir stores in other tourist places. Prepare to walk through a long line of options."
Baguio Night Market,"A bit crowdy since most of the tourist are buying some ""pasalubong"" here. We always go here to buy our dinner I recommend the store but I forgot the name. The store is in left part when you are standing in the entrance gate of the Night Market Food strip and they sell pork steak whick is so tender, sisig abd fried egg. The cost will be 80 php with rice if you want to add extra rice that will be 15 php. I also love the chicharong bituka they only have 2 stores there who sell that and I prefer the one who sell it with pares. The sweet cheesy corn is what I always buy there and I prefer the 1st store who sell that near the entrance gate."
Baguio Night Market,"THERE'S A LOT OF CHEAP MERCHANDISE HERE such as ukay( or second hand clothes), souvenirs, food, and also entertainment from local street performers.BAGUIO is known for its cold temperature and that makes this place a comfortable place to go."
Baguio Night Market,"Better now that they separated the food and goods market. Looked more organized. It still gets busier than ever, but it's definitely all worth the visit especially if you want some cheap finds!"
Baguio Night Market,There were a lot of good deals at the Baguio Night market. New & used things. Eady parking and very organized. I accidentally dropped my wallet and a nice young teen girl.found and returnred it me. No mask no entry policy.
Baguio Night Market,This place opens at 9PM. This is very late. I suggest opening it a bit earlier. There are limited options but the prices are cheap as expected. If you just want to spend the night away then this is the place for you in Baguio.
Baguio Night Market,"We really enjoyed thrifting here at night market, the ukay ukay are very cheap. It took us like 2 hours or so just strolling here, we didnt even get the chance to stroll at the food section as ive heard that they also sell cheap food but tasty."
Baguio Night Market,Lots of choices! Entered from the left and exited on the right part. Stalls near the entrance of the food place have much cheaper options (from our experience)
Baguio Night Market,"As always, Baguio City Night Market at Harrison Road near Melvin Jones is a great place to visit and experience at Baguio. It only opens 7 PM with plenty of ukay ukay selections, bargain & unique finds, with classic street foods and of course the cold breeze."
Baguio Night Market,"Too crowded on Saturday nights, better be there on Sundays to thursday.If you're looking for ukay jacket price ranging from 350 to 1500 for the good ones. Beware of jackets that are sold the same as from your local tiangge or divisoria / taytay rizal.For the food, perfect as you have hundreds of options. But no table and chairs in the area.Public restrooms are available in the area."
Baguio Night Market,"So many options along the night market. There's a rule about only going one way, which is good for traffic. If you get lucky you can get branded items for cheap. I wasn't lucky the night I went, but I got to see this really interesting toy. :)"
Baguio Night Market,Too many stores with the same options.What I liked in there is the food bazaars which is more spacious and has lots of options. Maybe they can add pasalubong centers or kiosk.Place is not so secured even the locals will warn you of thieves and pickpockets despite police visibility.
Baguio Night Market,"Enjoyed night market, i went here around 9pm. If you love thrifting, this is the right place but make sure you have enough patience to deal with the large crowd. The stalls are super long too so you have a lot of options to buy from."
Baguio Night Market,Simply not what it used to be. Yes there are cheap t-shirts and fake shoes but most stalls seem to be selling the same things. The street food is ok but to be honest you are better off walking across the room to the stalls there and street food vendors.
Baguio Night Market,Night market starts at 9:00pm to 2:00am.Just expect heavy traffic and lack of cabs for lift.Some of the stalls have Gcash as payment optios. (You must try the ₱1 Gcash strawberry taho as well! Haha)

Baguio Night Market,Baguio’s night market is located at harrison road near tiong San. The night market starts at around 9pm. The One side of harrison road is closed and it is where the pop up stalls are installed. Near the road there is also a location where foods and snacks are installed. When we visited the night market it was crowded and was a bit difficult to walk. Be careful when walking around the night market because there might be snatchers to get your valuables.
Baguio Night Market,"It was a very refreshing night for me and my family!, All items are cheap and on good quality, the food was superb good! I love every moment of it, but there's a hassle with the restrooms, some have long lines and some closes early, but overall it was an amazing experience for us."
Baguio Night Market,"place is very much alive at night. police patrolling and some are on stand-by so you feel secured. you can get great deals if you look diligently, as there are cheap clothes, jackets, shoes, etc...got a pureboost addidas shoe from an ukay store - slightly used but still a great fit...for only $29be wary of counterfeits as well so look closely and know the difference before you buy."
Baguio Night Market,"Much much more organized than the last time I was here. Stalls still don't fix their items by size (which would save a ton of time for a ton of people), and still don't really care to help, to make a sale or not. But other than that, still a nice place to get ukay items and cheap products. They pack up at 12mn, fyi."
Baguio Night Market,"A very good place to hang out with friends, families, especially tourist and enjoy the cold weather.Varieties of food, brand new, and thrift clothes are available for you to choose from.Hopefully, their would be a place to properly sit on after long walks around the area."

Baguio Night Market,It was fun.. first time to experience Baguio Night Market. Hope to get back here again.
Baguio Night Market,"It is a great place for bargain-hunting especially when buying pre-loved clothing for winter and sneakers. We visit this place often when we go to Baguio.Unfortunately, this time, our guests were not satisfied with the deals -with branded bags and sneakers. They only bought souvenirs, while I bought a tie-dye shirt.I noticed the place was too crowded that Saturday night. We were told to be aware of pickpockets, adding more to anxiety, the police trainees were not in the crowd but on the sides of the area.Parking places are hard to find in the area. And most vehicles -probably new tourists- park on the wrong place, hence, their license plates get confiscated.Better commute when going here, and take breaks in between. Try to observe health protocols, if you can"
Baguio Night Market,"OMG the cheapest ukay-ukay I've known. Not really into ukay-ukay, but this one is a must try! Located in Harrison Road, beside Burnham Park. This night markets starts at 9pm to 4pm daily."

Baguio Night Market,Has improved very much in terms of organizing. There 3 sections. One must follow directions. No counterflow allowed. Food stalls are located in separate area.
Baguio Night Market,Better to go on a weekday but great deals when it comes to buying preloved clothing. There's also a lot of food selection so you can take a break after buying from Ukay-Ukay. Parking is difficult so it's better to walk a ride a taxi.
Baguio Night Market,"Full of display and lot of shoppers searching for the best and a very affordable prices. I only saw few display for souvenirs, and sadly I do not see mugs which my relatives loves."
Baguio Night Market,"Can find affordable stuff here clothes, food and trinkets to name a few"
Baguio Night Market,Definitely a sight to see if and while you are in Baguio. Why was it just ok? Too crowded to even think much less try things on. Plus clothing g gets a bit repetitive after a block or so.If you don’t like crowds you would hate this.
Baguio Night Market,"Baguio night market is a long stretch of market nga that offers foods, bags and clothings for a low price because some are hand me downs or over runs I don't know well if you want your outfit of the day but with low budget and branded products then this is the place where you'll find your ootd outfits for winter. It's a good thing that they've placed swat and policemen around the market so you'll feel safe and secured."
Baguio Night Market,Typical late night tiangge. They have korean street food!
Baguio Night Market,I like the service in the food area considering that they put more food or servings into it than in the morning. I think i much prefer eating street food in night market than morning considering of the amount of food they serve. Very worth it.  Medyu pricy lang yung mga benta na mga damit or etc.
Baguio Night Market,"Loads of shops, but most have similar stock. Snatchers everywhere."
Baguio Night Market,It was so crowded when we went there. Don't take your kids when you go there. Lots of really cheap stuff you can buy. This is definitely a place to go to when you're in Baguio.

Baguio Night Market,"Street shopping - Saturday is chaotic, avoid weekends if you want full enjoyment.Food - Dinakdakan porkyfat with few strips of liver in mayonaise (what you pay is what you get)Matabang ang Mango, strawberry  lychee juice."
Baguio Night Market,Mahirap sumakay ng taxi pauwi. We walked 3 km from night market to our hotel carrying the things we bought dahil walang nagsasakay na taxi!!! A lot are empty yet not giving us a ride. It was a Saturday they should expect tourists to come around. Not a good experience 😑
Baguio Night Market,Not so crowded during weekdays. But weekends... 😓😅
Baguio Night Market,It is already far way different from what we used to have but still some great finds. You just need to be keen enough to roam around.
Baguio Night Market,Love it... but the stalls have similar products... wish they could hqve variety of different products not just jackets and rubber shoes....
Baguio Night Market,Usually it opens at 9:00pm on weekdays. A must visit when you are in Baguio.

Baguio Night Market,This Kebab Food Stall is a must-try!
Baguio Night Market,Baguio Night Market.. one of the night life in baguio city.. your visit in baguio city is not complete if you don't see this place.. #BoyBagito
Baguio Night Market,"Police are stationed everywhere ensuring one-way flow of people and that protocols are followed, all stalls have alcohol for use, BUT it's the people who are still so hard-headed who would push and cram themselves not caring that they are already brushing into other people just to look at the items for sale. One meter physical distancing? They can't even stay 1mm away. Again, this is not the police's shortcomings, but the lack of discipline of the people."
Baguio Night Market,"Food, shoes, clothings, souvenirs. You can find it here. All you need is money, patience and enough energy to check all of those stalls. Having knowledge on legit pairs is also great. You can find used legit pairs from 650-1.5k. Cheap jackets starting at 3 for 50pesos-1k. Depending on how you bargain for it. They are open at 9pm-2am but if it's not peak season they're closing at 12mn."
Baguio Night Market,"It was always great going back here. Specially the night market. Theres a lot of sales ""ukay"" going on. Theres plenty tto choose from but not enough time and money. Hehe. Loved the korean food stall, but the pork and chicken kebab is a must try."
Baguio Night Market,Great place to buy things at a bargain. Courteous police officers are also in constant monitor of the safety and social distancing protocols.
Baguio Night Market,Wide variety from Class A to original 2nd hand. Sellers are generous in giving 'tawad' but don't abuse them so they can make profit out of it. Shops are open from 9pm to 2am. There's a lot food stalls to choose from. Taxis are operating 24/7.
Baguio Night Market,"If you have patience, then go experience Baguio's night market... affordable products are everywhere. I suggest you to try also their shawarma rice not because it is one of my favs but you have to get try it yourself while it chills."
Baguio Night Market,"For the adventurous, if you'd rather eat out, visit the food stalls inside the park. There's always something good to eat."
Baguio Night Market,I got my denim jacket there for ₱100 only. Not to mention some of the stalls offer clothes that are in my budget but some are offering clothes that are way out of my budget.
Baguio Night Market,"Baguio's night market is a place where you can get big discounts on clothes and other items. Aside from that, they also have a lot of food stalls to fill up your tummy. This is one of the things you should try when you are in Baguio."
Baguio Night Market,Good kind of return to some normalcy activity/event for Baguio. Bargain finds and good food and snacks. LGU needs to improve crowd control.
Baguio Night Market,"As in the past, you'll get really good deals here at unbelievably low prices. From jackets to shoes, and beddings to carved wooden stuff, you'll surely get bang for your buck items. Come at 9pm though, to maximize your shopping time. They start packing up at 12:30AM if there aren't much shoppers coming around."

Baguio Night Market,"A must see for any visitor to Baguio.  It’s basically a pop up market that materializes when half of Harrison street is closed to traffic after 9pm.Prices are also agreeable for finding Pasalubong.  I was a happy camper after buying plenty of shirts and coffee and peanut brittle, with some shawarma to end the night.Keep your belongings secure as it gets really crowded."
Baguio Night Market,"Super crowded despite the one way policy that is not really followed. The food section is nice. More space and the shawarma have the longest queue. They must be delicious. In the souvenirs/clothes section, you find pretty much the same time every 50 meters. No need to do all the sections, it's just repeat."
Baguio Night Market,"Its good for those wanting to have a night life out of the breezy evening, ung pa-stroll stroll lang sa session road then you'll wind up in harrizon road"
Baguio Night Market,"Best place to shop for bargain and or used goods. Very disciplined system, one way sa kabilaan. Secured by policemen. I bought bnew jackets here for a second-hand price. Highly recommended!"

Baguio Night Market,"A good place for hangout and chillin,you could also buy more stuff here like souvenirs and etc."
Baguio Night Market,"This place gives you something to do at night(other than bar hopping) when in Baguio. Place is very crowded so be wary of your surroundings. Items for sale are not very notable. Street food stalls are also here.*Lucky to be back in Baguio(June 1, 2018) and visit the Night Market again. Better bring an umbrella if you think it's gonna rain."
Baguio Night Market,Baguio Licensing Department allows vendor to sell spoiled foods. I was food poisoned last Friday night @ Baguio Night Market. Disgusting!
Baguio Night Market,"Good place for budget budol where you can buy street food, shoes, clothes which is open even on weekdays"
Baguio Night Market,"My Partner loves it. Its just perfect night when we got there, Friday night and the weather is just right. We stroll a bit to look for something to buy. I spot a jacket perfect fit for him. The vendor asking for a very expensive price, but I'm good at dealing, so we got it for a good price. We walk for an hour. And ended up on the other side where cheap food is served. I didn't took, and I didn't let him eat, because we might got stomach ache,just for insurance.  but the food seems really tasty. The people are lively and its busy."
Baguio Night Market,Nice place to shop...very genuine at a very affordable prices....
Baguio Night Market,It was a great experience..very organize and everyone observed discipline. Police is everywhere for peace and order.
Baguio Night Market,"Good food like shawarma, bulalo, dinakdakan, mami, sisig, korean finger food.  Good to nice ukay products like jackets, shirts, pajamas for all ages. Other novelty products are being sold here. These products add more bang for your bucks.Night market starts at 9pm to 1pm. Security is good with standby police near the pedestrian overpass. The public should be aware of their personal belongings so as to avoid being victims of pickpocketers.It is a must try for tourists and locals alike."
Baguio Night Market,Cheap but great finds. Street foods are good too
Baguio Night Market,Health protocols were properly reminded to all buyers/tourists. And the visibility of uniformed authorities helps the flow of traffic in the area.
Baguio Night Market,"Get ready for the crowd! The Baguio Night Market is where you can buy really cheap secondhand coats, jackets, sweaters, jeans, and shoes. They set up at around 9pm so you better be there to start shopping early!"
Baguio Night Market,Well they will take your money quickly but won't let you smoke anywhere. They'll even sell you cigarettes but then don't let you smoke them. In a nutshell Baguio sucks and I'll never spend another penny here as long as I live.
Baguio Night Market,A bargain-hunters paradise...you may get all kinds of clothes & footwear here...the place is Soo spacious and comfortable because they open at night...the whole stretch of Burnham Park is almost occupied and you can cover all the lanes for as long as you want...a lot of bargains can be had in this place...just feel free to roam around coz it's free! Happy shopping! 💕
Baguio Night Market,"We went July 1 while it was raining to try the food. There are many food and drink options for a decent price. There aren't any tables or chairs to make eating easier, and there were only a few tents for standing room. Prices were low. Food was okay for street food. The trash bins are few, and are not replaced frequently."
Baguio Night Market,"It is a must experience activity in baguio. The market was known for selling pre loved and brand new jackets at an amazingly cheap prices yet some of it are really classy.Also, it was amazing to eat street foods during midnight. I really enjoyed this experience with my love."
Baguio Night Market,Used to be a shopping paradise for a feeling fashionista like me. Now? Not anymore. There's a lot of clothes to browse through but very outdated selection and most of the clothes are too old.  It's not fun to do ukay ukay anymore on this side of the city... Now I wonder where are the nice ukay ukay?
Baguio Night Market,"If you're looking for something to do while you're in Baguio, this definitely a must try.They have huge selection of street food and stalls but most products here are wagwag or ukay, not really a good place to buy pasalubong."
Baguio Night Market,"Baguio City's night shopping market around Burnham park in the city centre opens for business daily at 8pm onwards. Luckily were anable to find some stuffs in a fair price. So if u plan to go here just make sure ur hotel is nearby cause u have some trouble making your way back where you stay because its to hard to take a    taxi. Expect too many people & get crushed and pushed. Dont wear jewelrys. According to rappler ""Baguio’s night market at Harrison Road, said to be the country’s version of Bangkok’s Patpong, is in danger of being closed or transferred."""
Baguio Night Market,You can find a lot of stuff at reasonable and cheaper prices.
Baguio Night Market,Queue is not organize in some stall that seller allow

Baguio Night Market,Many things to buy and choose from. Not so crowded at this time and date (August 2022). Weather is cool and no rain.

Baguio Night Market,"Great night market! Great for street food and for thrift stores, pasalubong and a nice walk without cars around."
Baguio Night Market,"Lots of stuff being sold. Safety is okay since police are everywhere. However, it's really crowded especially during peak hours. Make sure you take care of your stuff and belongings."
Baguio Night Market,"Very crowded but that is to be expected. Most products being sold are the same things such as key chains, shoes, clothes and electronics. For the most part you are to busy fighting the flow of the crowd to even look at the stalls. Overall it's overated. In short don't go out of your way to come here."
Baguio Night Market,First time in Baguio. Amazed by how their night market is organized. People are so humble and peaceful. Low prices but got good quality.
Baguio Night Market,"Affordable street food! The night market starts at 9pm. You can buy 2nd hand clothes (not sure if some sells new), toys, shoes and even accessories. Food options includes korean streetfood, noodles, pinoy streetfood and rice meals. Ensure that you secure your belongings too."

Baguio Night Market,Great place to find everything you need. From your daily needs to any sorts

Baguio Night Market,It was like being a kid in a candy store.  Enjoyed the variety of foods.
Baguio Night Market,"It was really fun going in here. There were lots of 'ukay-ukay' stores (second hand apparels store) and other stores where you can buy brand new items and souvenirs, but what we really enjoyed was the street food. It was fun eating hot street food while enjoying the cold night."
Baguio Night Market,Social distancing is practiced. People are wearing face mask and police is stationed around the area. Good deal on blankets and jackets
Baguio Night Market,"Super love here. A lot of choice from food to clothes accessories and other useful items. A lot of good finds specially for the ukay. You just have to be patient in selecting good pieces. For food, super lot of choices and you will definitely find your cravings here. Vendors are super nice to and for the most part it is affordable."
Baguio Night Market,Too crowded. Ukay prices same as or higher than those being sold through Shopee Live hehe we just went for snacking and biking
Baguio Night Market,"Meh selection as most good pieces are already bought by online resellers. Some ""Vintage"" tees are priced as bnew."
Baguio Night Market,love the ukay all over the place. great bargains if you know how to choose..hoping for more food trips here. crowd is crazy..its fun to see them prep fast 9pm exact.
Baguio Night Market,"Great finds, good food.. Kids below 11 not allowed.. Wear comfortable footwear.. 🙂"
Baguio Night Market,a street turning into a public market for thrift shoppers every night at 9pm - who doesn't like that? 😁 there is also a food park that will probably have something to satisfy your cravings. the area is also well organized and is kept under protection with the help of local police. a must-see place for tourists!

Chairs were well maintained. Hidden Side tables by the chair were very clean, too. The whole place is very well maintained. It would be nice to have conventions there. 👍🏼"
Baguio Night Market,Very nice for tourists. There’s also food stalls aside from the night market
Baguio Night Market,Too crowded and too many sellers overpricing preloved items. More sellers give these oreloved items at the lowest prices. Keep your valuables secured from pickpockets and bring w/ you disinfectants because the preloved items aren't washed. Better be safe than sorry folks 😉
Baguio Night Market,A crowded place to buy cheap second hand clothes. Worth a vidit if you are looking for some branded used things.
Baguio Night Market,"My family and I got there before 9pm, and we got to see how the sellers would really wait for 9pm and the ""go signal"" of the police before they set up everything.And because Baguio has a chilly weather, you would mostly see coats and jackets at the Night Market.Most of the sellers were kinda grumpy when we got there (must be feeling under the weather?)Anyway, it's a nice place to go to for cheap shopping (I found an authentic Adidas Windbreaker for only 150php).Would come back if given the chance again."
Baguio Night Market,Cheap and good quality of clothes. Assorted jackets sold for a lowest rate. I was able to buy mine for only 50 pesos. Food choices were limited though.

Baguio Night Market,few stalls and the food stalls now in the parking area and you can eat with social distance.
Baguio Night Market,"You can buy cheap jeans and jackets here and the quality is still ok, souvenir items and even your basic undergarments can be bought here. Just be ready to get yourself clothes-diving"
Baguio Night Market,"One will love the experience in this Night Market. Whether you intend to buy or not, you'll enjoy walking the stretch of the shops in the area. There's a comfort room and some food stalls also... and don't forget eating taho (ube and strawberry flavor). Enjoy the experience!!!"
Baguio Night Market,No social distancing 🤣🤣🤣But its nice to be back..
Baguio Night Market,Came a little bit early than the 9pm sched so naglibot ako sa kabila for chicken skin. Andami. HahahaGreat buys and deals. A lot of foods and ugh ansaya! Come experience the Baguio Night Market! Just be careful though. Wag magdamit na parang tourista tlaga pra d ka mpagtripan 😊 andami foods dito as iiinnnn.
Baguio Night Market,"I go here every Saturday night to eat binatog and shawarma.....They are open as early as 7PM, protocols are still observed."
Baguio Night Market,"The weather is the best! The food was good for a traveler, shawarma was a HIT!"
Baguio Night Market,There we're lots of people even on weekdays but the experience still is amazing.The food and things sold here are cheap especially the jackets which u really need for this type of weather here.
Baguio Night Market,"So many things to see and buy. Go here at 9:30 pm if you want the stalls to be ready because at 9 they are still setting up.The food stalls at the other end are open earlier I think so you may want to eat there first.Look for the shawarma place that has a long line because even if it's cheap (less than 80 pesos), it tastes good and the serving is big.  The meat has been pre-chopped so it doesn't take long to get your order, well unless the person before you ordered a lot 😁 There is a stall selling Korean snacks but has a very long line, if you have time and patience, give it a try.Make sure that you have a ride home because it's difficult to hail a taxi late at night, not even Grab. We went with our kids and only to grab a bite, and we walked about 30 mins before we found a taxi. We still had a memorable night."
Baguio Night Market,Nice market place n affordable prices
Baguio Night Market,"I was able to buy all the pasalubong here, the price were reasonable and swack to my budget 👍"
Baguio Night Market,Just be patient to go through all the options and you'll definitely find your gem. One of the best ukay-ukay spots especially when you're shopping for winter clothes or anything you can wear on a cold weather.
Baguio Night Market,"If you love ukay-ukay and street foods, this place is for you."
Baguio Night Market,Pretty crowded during the weekend and summer season. I would recommend going here at least around 10:30PM just so it wont be that crowded. You can buy so many great finds at cheap prices! Bring lots and lots of patience. Not for people who hates crowded places.
Baguio Night Market,"At exactly 9pm, road is closed to build these green tents and for us to enjoy the night market."
Baguio Night Market,"Best for thrift people, go-to place if you love midnight foodtrips"
Baguio Night Market,super crowded area. visit at your own risk since no protocol in maintaining minimum public health standard is in place.
Baguio Night Market,"A baguio trademark, one of the must visit at night in the city of pines. The night market starts at 9pm if your up to ukay ukay or for a food trip and enjoy the baguio weather. 😊"
Baguio Night Market,"Decent place not a huge bargain compared to normal prices. I read on other reviews people can bargain on price. They didn't budge for me at all, but it doesn't hurt to try."
Baguio Night Market,"Too crowded but you gotta score good deal. For as low as Php10 you can have a good quality ukay-ukay shirt, blazer for below Php100 and branded clothes for below Php150. You just have to be patient and check carefully the clothes that you’re buying as their might be stain that can’t be removed.Bring flashlight for clothes checking and take care of your belongings.If you’re not into buying ukay-ukay then it’s a great place to have a food trip. Variety of street foods are available here."
Baguio Night Market,Food have hardly any variations. It seems like stock is bought from the same supplier for 70% of the stalls
Baguio Night Market,The best place to buy Ukay Ukay goods
Baguio Night Market,"Love it! U can find and hardle so many different bargains from shirt, bags, jeans, polo shirt, jogging pants so many."
Baguio Night Market,Tons of cheap stuff to find. Good if you are buying souvenirs and pre-loved items. Street food are available too.The place is too crowded however - but all in all should still be included in your itinerary.
Baguio Night Market,"To go to this place you'll need to park in Burnham Park which is just close by. This is the portion of Harrison St. that they close by 9 pm in order to set up shop.Pros: you can find cheap clothes here for 20 pesos. They may stink a little because these are definitely old and used. Patience rewards those who scour the racks. Great finds and unbelievable prices.Cons: there seem to be less and less pre-loved or used RTW clothes and more of the China branded, new items. Turning into a Greenhills. It's slowly losing its identity.Nonetheless, it gets a 5 star from me for the food, great finds and selection of clothes."
Baguio Night Market,Has lots of stalls for goods and food to choose from
Baguio Night Market,Good to see that the normality of precovid has returned.
Baguio Night Market,"Good to buy cheap secondhand branded clothings,shoes and bags."
Baguio Night Market,9om to 2am operations only and careful with one way walking. Bring a big bag if you plan to shop a lot and ukay a lot
Baguio Night Market,"This market is a fun experience, all types of food and good vendors.  Check out the fresh coffee roastery."
Baguio Night Market,"This used to be a place to find great deals for a cheap price. Now it is designed for tourists. Not a place to buy ""ukay-ukay"" its so NOT worth it."

Baguio Night Market,"SUPER CROWDED.   Do not bring your children if youre planning to visit here, they might get lost.  Also,  BEWARE of thieves, as there are people who just cant resist to take your wallet/phone. Itll be too late when you realize that your wallet/phone is gone."
Baguio Night Market,A night of wet market in Baguio😅
Baguio Night Market,The place is great but it is too crowded. Maybe because of the long weekend - August 29 Holiday.
Baguio Night Market,I like the selection of food and prices. I wish they would start earlier. People are just standing around waiting for the vendors to setup and open. It should open at 7 pm or 8 pm. Traffic will always be an issue and opening the night market later is not solving the problem.
Baguio Night Market,nice jackets and boots at affordable price
Baguio Night Market,It is advisable to have friends who live in Baguio City to know where to catch great deals in the night market.

Baguio Night Market,If youre a fan of 2nd hand clothes called Ukay Ukay this place is for you. Maybe this place is heaven for you haha. But little bit crowded its look like night market of divisoria when christmas is approaching. Not so pricey clothes. And also they have local foods to eat

Baguio Night Market,Be mindful of your belongings as there are plenty of people roaming the street.
Baguio Night Market,..THIS PLACE WAS VERY AFFORDABLE THE UK UK ..
Baguio Night Market,"A place where you can buy clothes and item for daily use for a cheap price. Night market is a makeshift market on the road,it is a must go place if you're visiting Baguio City. Food Stall and Street food vendors are present in the area. Place   is usually crowded every peak season specially holidays.p.s Beware of Pickpockets"
Baguio Night Market,"you will feel excited about the low price but after checking the stuff at home you will find it an old clothes and simply a waste of money, there's no place to eat around but there's a lot of fast food but just need to sit anywhere in the fence."
Baguio Night Market,hard to get around. stalls that doesnt post the price are a bit pricey ( still cheaper than the mall ) place lacks security although you see police around. they are at one place instead of patroling the area. they have a kiosk with knives sold as a souvenir item makes it more unsafe to roam around. even saw a soneone ( about 16-18y/o ) unsheathing a knife showing at us. good thing we survive the night without deadly encounter. please make this place safer.
Baguio Night Market,Too crowded during holidays. Better come here after xmas & new year as I've experienced before. Moderate crowd and cheap finds.

Baguio Night Market,"IT'S SO FUN, like literally every single stand is selling gorgeous outfits, shoes, bags etc. Mostly for 30-50 Philippine Pesos Each. Quality of the items are so you know BEAUTIFUL, but I really suggest for everyone to bring a big eco bag to put all the things you brought because once you buy an item they will put it in a plastic bag and it'll be hard to hold specially they because don't tie the plastic bag."

Baguio Night Market,"It's very convenient for all nocturnal people who love to go shop for budget-friendly clothes and items. What's not so great about this place though, is the huge amount of people. For an hour or two of stressful ninja moves to be able to move through the waves of people and what do you get? an unsure item if it's worth it or not."
Baguio Night Market,"When you plan to go to the night market, it is recommended that you are on own vehicle going to town especially if residence/hotel is far from the location.  Cabs are limitted at this time of pandemic"

Baguio Night Market,"I am not really a fan of second hand clothes from other countries which, I suppose, are really donations being sold for profit. But I saw some new, first hand items or so I think. At one side of the stretch of clothing items for sale, right at the parking lot of Burnham Park, are great street foods, snacks and dinner items. We ate some takoyaki. There were stalls serving sisig with rice, beef mami, beef pares and others which you can buy very cheap. Since it is pandemic, there are roving men reminding everyone to mind their face shields and observe physical distancing. Great experience."
Baguio Night Market,"Sometimes, social distancing is not observed. Good thing, there are many police officers in the area who strictly implement wearing of face masks plus you cannot enter the vicinity without a face shield as of now."

Baguio Night Market,"You can have good bargains here, however, it's a lot more of the knock off products. It's also crowded (market nga di ba) that you can't shop comfortably. Likewise, limited lighting that you can't scrutinize flaws and damages of items.On the bright side, you can just go stroll in Burnham Park or Session Road if you didn't find anything."
Baguio Night Market,"The goods that they sell here is all the same that you can see in divisoria mall, the food stalls are good👍"
Baguio Night Market,Too crowded. Safety protocol not much observed.
Baguio Night Market,As long as the address moved im ok
Baguio Night Market,"Limitless options. From ukay-ukay products, garments, bags, accessories, pants, jackets, street foods, name it. They have it."
Baguio Night Market,Good...but so crowded
Baguio Night Market,"Its like a huge thrift shop, old clothes or shoes of low prices but originals. If you're lucky, you might be able to find something you wanted before but wasn't able to get. Usually very packed from 9 to 11. Foods are 👌 if you're not a picky eater and into street foods. It's a sticky adventure but nonetholess, it depends on you how you'll enjoy your night 😉."
Baguio Night Market,I love the thrill of buying. They are ooen from 9-1am
Baguio Night Market,"Good thing Baguio still have this night market every evening starting at 8pm. This time the food stalls are placed separately on the right side lot next to Igorot park. From street food to rice meals, this nightly streefood market can fill your tummy. Got my kebab meal of pork for 70php and 15php rice. It saved me some cash for dinner."
Baguio Night Market,"For those who are looking for murang ukay-ukay, this is the perfect place for you (aside from Bayanihan). Just take note that it's reallyyyyy crowded specially during weekends and holidays. Beware of the 'mandu' :)"
Baguio Night Market,Crowded but lots of various goods and stuff to buy
Baguio Night Market,"Went there last week of April 2019. The last time I attempted to go to the night market, we were advised they open at 11 in the evening. They made this earlier now to 9 PM. Too crowded so you couldn't stop to check on the items anymore. The prices are almost the same as the ones in Manila. This may be a case of bad timing but probably will only go back because of the affordable & tasty food sold next to it."
Baguio Night Market,Spongebob Lawyerpants Christmas Lawyer Attorney Festive
Baguio Night Market,"Your trip to Baguio isn’t complete without experiencing their night market. Unlike other night markets that focus solely on food, this one has streets lined with thrift clothes, shoes and other used goods. Its a great place to score good finds for less. Expect a jam-packed crowd, however, and always be mindful of your belongings."
Baguio Night Market,"I really like that there are various places to canvas for clothes and other various things to buy from. I went here and got a new coat for a price more affordable than what I could have gotten at the mall. They have various food stalls to choose from when I felt hungry and since its near the park, you dont need to look for a place to sit.The only thing I didnt like was the fact that there was so many people in the area that its hard to really take the time to look around as you needed to keep moving unless you wanted to block several people off.Aside from that, I do recommend visiting this place sometime if you're in the area."
Baguio Night Market,Fair
Baguio Night Market,So many chiefer things to buy here with a thousands of people moving.
Baguio Night Market,"Great for cheap priced goods, a good way to taste many 'putahe'. In weekdays, there's only few people. But in weekends, there's a great increase of people and tourist's also. The two ends of this night market offers foods, so you wont get hungry.Starts at 09:00 PM in the evening and ends in 02:00 AM."
Baguio Night Market,This has been a good experience for all as well as tourist from all over who wanted night shopping cause here can find cheap and branded materials specially clothings both imported and local.
Baguio Night Market,"Convenient for those late night shopping you need to do because every other shop is closed but you really need to buy clothes or gadgets before tomorrow. There's a variety of stuff here from novelty items, to second-hand clothes, to street food. It's a brilliant addition to the city's identity."
Baguio Night Market,Nothing interest me except the food stalls
Baguio Night Market,"Cheap shirts, jackets, shoes, blanckets and trinckets."
Baguio Night Market,Cool place for thrift shopping 🛍️
Baguio Night Market,"A great place to find stuff you want or need. Items range from shoes, clothes to souvenir items and there is also food selections. They are also sold on a very cheap price. Market starts at 9PM so better be there early since tourist tends to fill the area as the night goes by."
Baguio Night Market,The place is beautiful!
Baguio Night Market,best night market of baguio
Baguio Night Market,Its good that its no longer crowded and health protocols are implemented. Please have more options for food. There are some spaces that are still vacant and it would be best to have it occupied by vendors
Baguio Night Market,Nothing special. Its likr divisoria but cold
Baguio Night Market,Nice finds 2nd hand  original brands but be wary of counterfeit products that they try to mix in.
Baguio Night Market,A place for tourists to buy cheap knock-off items and legit second hand items. Its going to be crowded but its fun just walking-by. Both ends of the road offer quintessential Filipino street foods. Careful with your valuables because its also the time when tourist-pocket-pickers roam.
Baguio Night Market,Awesome place. You cannot get bored walking on the streets of baguio
Baguio Night Market,Nice experience. Just above Burngam Park.
Baguio Night Market,It isn't how I remembered it. There isn't much stalls like before. Clothes are very limited. It is understandable because there's a pandemic. I still love the night market though.
Baguio Night Market,"There's always a good bargain here.  Just gotta buy at the right time (very late when the vendors are about to pack up).  Try to be very sure about the items being purchased as the lighting is always bad, they're rarely brand new, and if they are, they're manufactured cheaply.  Best to try the street food!"
Baguio Night Market,"Baguio Night Market is located in Harrison Road. Opens as early as 9pm till 2am. You won't feel tired roaming the whole street, for a reason that you will see everything from left to right 😍"
Baguio Night Market,"It was a nice place to buy and roam around, perks to its weather. Prices are bearable."
Baguio Night Market,Some vendors are giving high price
Baguio Night Market,"It is a flea market although there are several stalls that also sell brand new stuff. Just be aware of pickpockets though and take precautions. Better yet, just bring enough cash with you preferably in loose change for obvious reasons."
Baguio Night Market,It crowded but fun  and safe to roam around
Baguio Night Market,"They only sell fake products there. It's cool if you're on a budget. However, I do not support the use of these fake items because it hurts the reputation of these brands of which they be duplicating from. There's a lot of street food also which caused me diarrhoea, so watch out! It's also very crowded so you gotta be careful with your personal belongings, the place is famous for people to get snatched."
Baguio Night Market,Nice way to end the night. Enjoy the cool Baguio breeze while enjoying whatever the stalls have to offer.
Baguio Night Market,Too crowded. But the products for sale are in good quality.
Baguio Night Market,Its so good. Lots of items you cam buy and its cheap price.
Baguio Night Market,Great finds and food
Baguio Night Market,"There are so many stalls. Many people come here. There are cheap or should I say affordable but nice jackets. They also sell shoes, bags, etc. The food here is so good. Must try their street foods."
Baguio Night Market,"Great findings on Ukay Ukay clothes, bags etc...very cheap and branded. People are very accommodating."
Baguio Night Market,"Besides is the summer capital of the Philippines, is clean, safe, and  the prices are the same for local and tourist; if you don't want to go to other place, you can find everything in one single place. I love theirs people. Good transportation anywhere you want to go. The mayor and the police are doing a great job."
Baguio Night Market,"A place to go if you want some night street food :) Not all they sell are 'ukay' and that's okay so people have options. Bring your haggling skills and get the best price for the goods :) for souvenirs though, I find it cheaper to buy from the stands around or in front of Mines View Park."
Baguio Night Market,Don't go here during peak season. You'll not enjoy shopping due to sea of crowd
Baguio Night Market,totally festive night market.
Baguio Night Market,This place is for shoppers who like crazy low prices for their clothes. Most of the cheap options are for women but there are also good finds for men too. Just be ready to be in a super crowded place because the walking space is extremely crowded.
Baguio Night Market,"Lots of cheap items for sale. 50 pesos for 3 shirts? Souvenir items, shoes, jackets, etc. my favorite is the lively food section. If u have a camera, take a time lapse video but be careful of pick pockets. One shopper got his phone stolen when we were there."
Baguio Night Market,Something you should experience when you go to Baguio
Baguio Night Market,"you can buy anything here like foods, crafts , shirts,shoes,bags,etc.."
Baguio Night Market,There are plenty of food ang Ukay Ukay's and you really have to be patient because of the long lines.
Baguio Night Market,"Cheap stuff especially when it comes to sweaters and jackets. Lowest bid based on experience is 30pesos a piece, depending on your negotiation skills.Good take home goodies and etchnic products. Friend of mine bought this miniature curved pocket knife built on a varnished wood, I presumed one from Benguet locals. Surely was he satisfied by price and quality.Overall , cold crowded place. Be wary of thieves. Closes 2 am PH time. A 4-star for commoner like me. Rich pips might not like the whole setup. Well goodluck and enjoy your vacation !"
Baguio Night Market,"I got my original Adidas jacket here for only P150.00! Haha!Actually, I enjoyed the experience of visiting Baguio Night Market. Even if it is quite crowded there, still, because of the cheap and affordable souvenir and clothing items and garments that you can possibly buy there, I can say that visiting the night market it is one of my best experiences in Baguio. ♥️"
Baguio Night Market,"If you are a night person then baguio night market is the one for you..there are clothes, shoes and many more..then the food of course.."
Baguio Night Market,Very interesting too many people going here to experience what a night market in Baguio has to offer .
Baguio Night Market,Love the ambience it's relaxing and clean
Baguio Night Market,"One of the best places to go in Baguio City is the Night Market along Harrison Road (beside the famous Session Rd). The road closes at 9PM and in a blink of an eye various stalls pops up. In here you will find clothes, shoes, souvenirs and many more. The entrance and exit to the night market are food stalls for street food lovers."
Baguio Night Market,"There are a lot of merchants selling 2nd hand clothing and shoes at a very affordable price. Aside from the used clothes, there are also a variety of bags that are being sold though most are knock offs. Street food and drinks are also available.  Electronic items are also available.Visiting the place on weekends and holidays... Expect a lot of shoppers making it difficult to move and walk from one shop to another.. The walkway for shoppers are really narrow. Have not heard of pickpockets though because of police visibility. Be sure to harness your bargaining skills when shopping at the night market."
Baguio Night Market,"Too many people, covid attraction"
Baguio Night Market,"I always enjoy going to the night market. It's a great place to find good deals, not just clothes and shoes and bags! Found some decent cigars there for cheap too one time. Browsing through the interesting handmade and native accessories there is fun too. You'll find lots of dreamcatchers, which is nice if you're a fan of them. Really go around first though, so you can find the best deal. I was about to buy a pair of sandals for 150 but the stall two slots away from them sold the very same sandals for 130. So go around and ask first before buying."
Baguio Night Market,Reasonable price on each item.. friendly and respectdul people towards to customer and buyers. Good weather. Brrrrrr!
Baguio Night Market,Very good 👍
Baguio Night Market,Baguio Night Market is usually crowded. It's nice and you can buy cheaper preloved items.Just be prepared for a long walk if you intend to check all the stores. Have fun!
Baguio Night Market,"Starts at 10pm. You can find different types of clothing, Jackets, shoes, bags and accessories for a very affordable prices. I bought a 80 peso Jacket and its very worth it. You can also find 10, 20 pesos jackets here. You just have to be zealous in finding the right items with the right price for you"
Baguio Night Market,Best experience. I was able to purchase 10 ootd items in just 320 pesos
Baguio Night Market,So chill and refreshing air
Baguio Night Market,You'll find great buys here! Bought 2 branded shoes and a bag and the price was worth it.
Baguio Night Market,I love night markets! Baguio Night Market is teeming with cheap goodies but the crowd is too much for me because I can't barely move and it makes purchasing difficult. They close just one side of the road that's why the space is not enough. I was also looking forward for the Filipino street food but got disappointed because there wasn't a lot of choices at the time of my visit. I just ate strawberry taho which I enjoyed.
Baguio Night Market,Nice place to buy clothes etc.
Baguio Night Market,Just make strolling was very cold..
Baguio Night Market,Good and. Clean environment
Baguio Night Market,The night market is teeming with great finds for a cheaper price. There is also a food bazaar if ever your tummy requires some replenishment. Key is to haggle to lower the price even more!!
Baguio Night Market,"Its just okay. The market is just a typical ukay-ukay you van find anywhere, the quality of the goods are the same of a typical ukay-ukay but cost more. Really nothing special.The food stalls here are the only thing that makes this place special. They offer street food that is not typically seen on local streets and taste great!"
Baguio Night Market,An opportunity to buy good stuffs with best price.
Baguio Night Market,"Lots of food choices, Lots of choices of clothes as well and nice people around"
Baguio Night Market,"Experience the cold and happy night, while walking and see the wonderful moment with your love one."
Baguio Night Market,"nice place, great foods and ukay ukay"
Baguio Night Market,"You can find Baguio night market at Harrison rd. Which is near the entrance of Burnham park the whole road is full shoes, jackets, souvenirs, bags, shades, all you can find it here in a cheap price. Also if your good at bargaining you can score good condition items. It was fun milling around with the crowd just make sure you secure your purse and if you have kids hold on them tight. The crowd can go  shoulder to shoulder. It was just walking distance from where we stay."
Baguio Night Market,Very busy but a lot of choices. This should be a part of your itinerary when you visit baguio.
Baguio Night Market,"Night Market at Baguio is so awesome, it feels like you are in Korea because so many Korean street foods, so you better prepare your stomach before going night market or else you will be seducted to buy street foods. Not just the food but also the cheap items they selling, clothes, shoes, pants etc. With this place you will feel like your out of this world."
Baguio Night Market,It's very near the market and just after session road. Lots of food stalls even Korean ones and they're cheap! Very nice for people who like streetfoods! Cheap and delicious! There are also clothing stalls that sell new and vintage ones. You can buy a shirt for 10 pesos. Jacket for 25pesos. Just very crowded so be careful with your bags and wallets.
Baguio Night Market,"A bit challenging to traverse to, but that's a good sign that people are in what the market can bring. Food section is relatively clean and organized. Feels safe because of cops and firefighters are there."
Baguio Night Market,Close at 8esh and littlebit flat. Need more time to wake up after the pandemic but ... Still awesome cheap! Yea
Baguio Night Market,"cleaner than before....but still crowded and not much social distancing is being enforced by police, not even the wearing of face masks and face shields are enforced well.....but better than before"
Baguio Night Market,"Lots of cheap items to buy! Though needs to have keen eyes to see which ones are good buys and which ones are not.Some second hand items (usually clothes, shoes, and bedsheets) are sold, and also brand new ones at low cost. Not sure though if the brand new items are authentic or imitations (I don't have keen eyes to identify which ones)."
Baguio Night Market,"...you will find the NEW night market inside burnham park (lake drive) not far from the original location; most locals would know and would point you your way - affordable clothes mostly, with some booth for street food and drinks ...you can practice your haggling skills, but be careful of coming across as stingy or miserly"
Baguio Night Market,Prices are still cheaper and you can find almost anything.
Baguio Night Market,"Over rated. The ones on sale are old clothing. You have to walk through crowds of people so it's definitely difficult to shop. Been there twice, I wouldn't want to go back anymore."
Baguio Night Market,I love the food and the stuff that they are selling.i see that it is kind of organize now unlike way back before pandemic.
Baguio Night Market,"Too much fake jackets & very cramped spaces. Original shoes, sneakers, but DO NEVER FORGET TO BARGAIN... Less than 100meters of dry goods display..used clothing (branded & unbranded), divisoria/baclaran type clothings.. stalls normally open at 8pm and start to close at 1am.."
Baguio Night Market,"I imagine this market is much more pleasant outside of summer season, like the rest of Baguio must be. The walkways are extremely crowded during peak season, and you'll have a hard time navigating. Most of the items for sale were random clothes and knock-off shoes. Not too many cultural trinkets or unusual objects. There are some food stalls at the end that sell the typical Filipino street food. I found the regular market further down the road much more interesting, as they sold local coffee beans, honey, pasalubong, and the normal fresh products you'd expect at a market."
Baguio Night Market,"Went thrifting here and honestly I was only planning on filling up 1 eco bag but ended up with 3. Great finds, though i had to re inspect what I bought in my hotel room because the place is too dark to properly see what youre buying; also as expected, it gets very crowded.All of what I got were still in great condition, though some of them required more attention in terms of washing it.Its best to wait for it to open rather than coming in later in the night as the better pieces get snagged at the very beginning of the night.(Not the cheapest place to go thrifting in Baguio, according to my friends who live there)"
Baguio Night Market,I got a nice nike short
Baguio Night Market,"Nice experience! Full-packed stand-ins, with variety of cheap and branded goods to choose from. Complete with food stalls to fully satisfy your Baguio trip. Will definitely go back there again."
Baguio Night Market,"Strolling at night ,holding a barbecue stick and a bowl of goto is Life!"
Baguio Night Market,"It's open at 9:00 pm everyday along Harrison Road and closes around 12:00am, there are some stalls still open beyond this hour, but usually most of the stalls will be packing and closed. There are also a variety of food you can enjoy, a lot of finger food but there are also viands and rice of you're that hungry.You can see a lot of ""Ukay-ukay"" goods from clothes, shoes, bags and etc. You can also buy souvenir items like Baguio shirts, bonnets, keychain and etc.It's near Burnham Park, we usually stroll here first while waiting for the stalls to set up. It's also near Session Road. The place is usually packed so I suggest going there early and look out for your valuables as this kind of places attracts different kinds of people.The over all experience going here is fun, just be mindful of your sorroundings and your good to go. Just be a responsible citizen and put your garbage in the right place😊"
Baguio Night Market,Separate area for  RTW Goods to Food Kiosk and have Safe Security by PNP. Great Night Market...
Baguio Night Market,"The place is not that crowded when I went there. However, with Baguio's current event, the place might be a bit crowded."
Baguio Night Market,"Still a great place to buy cheap but good guality new or used clothes. But the place is very crowded and walk ways was enough for 2 lanes of people side by side wherein if one side stops to check on the items, that lane will stop moving."
Baguio Night Market,"It was nice and good, flea market is so cheap.But dont go there if you are in a rush."
Baguio Night Market,Lots of good items. Bought an original nike shoes for 1400. Original price on store is 4k. Its still brand new. Looks like it has only been worn once or twice
Baguio Night Market,It is been a good experienced to be part of the Night Market Vendors where you involved in any kind of celebrations in Baguio. You can meet a lot of people from different areas of the Philippines and even tourist too. Night Market is always pack everytime there's an occasion and one thing they will always say Baguio is one of the most honest taxi drivers in town.
Baguio Night Market,Best UKAY!
Baguio Night Market,The opens only from 9pm onwards.
Baguio Night Market,I love it I already buy in there and it's too cheap 😂😂😂 more buy to go when I visit ... And the food love it! 😋
Baguio Night Market,"Its enjoyable if you can tolerate walking in a really compact crowd. And of course you need to look out for the products too. They're cheap for a reason. And also look out for thieves (always, wherever and whenever)"
Baguio Night Market,Much nicer now! The shopping area separated to food area
Baguio Night Market,Affordable items. Prices are negotiable. I highly suggest asking for a discount. You need to check the item thoroughly in case if there are some defects like holes or damaged zippers. So crowded. Walking distance from burnham.
Baguio Night Market,"This street market opens at 9 pm till the wee hours of the morning. here they sell  2nd hand imported goods, I even saw them selling my fitflop rubber shoes which were bought in the US just in November (and this.was December )for a quarter of the price and still looked decent enough🙄. This street becomes really packed upon opening cause they want to have first digs at the stuff..ot gets less crowded towards midnight. They sell all kinds of stuff from coats,jackets, shoes, bags, tshirts, watches, sunglasses, plants and yes even dogs for pets (secretly)..they carry the pups in ecobags and bring them out for you to.see and cuddle hopefully making a sale..i guess thats better than turning them to azucena.😥😣"
Baguio Night Market,"There were less people during the nCov outbreak but the selections are still pretty good. They still vary from Taytay's famous tiangge at competitive prices. And there's also some food stalls by the two ends of the night market, which completes the mood."
Baguio Night Market,"Love love love it. People are surprisingly quite while they shop. Which is something unusual in a huge market place. But people are lovely! Not so sure about the street food. I had corn in a cup, and there was a small strand of hair."
Baguio Night Market,Great finds
Baguio Night Market,"Night market is good as you can enjoy walking at night. They sells clothes, fake shoes, phone accessories, and street food. Everything is extremely cheap, but be aware of pick pockets.."
Baguio Night Market,Nice place if you're looking for 2nd hand clothes for cold season..
Baguio Night Market,"Very good second-hand products, and experience . Just don't be fooled with the yellow lights 😂 Good luck!"
Baguio Night Market,"If you want Jackets, then you must visit this place."
Baguio Night Market,"Great experience shopping at Baguio Night Market. All things are affordable even if you have Php 20 you can buy a beautiful dress. A bit tiring experience but it was fun. They have original shoes and you can buy it in a cheaper price. Just bring your mask if you have an allergy in ""Ukay-Ukay"""
Baguio Night Market,Lots of cool stuff to buy specially RTW clothings.
Baguio Night Market,"Crowded night market where new and used goods are mixed. Some deals, some not, just like the vendors some haggle, some don't. I tried some heated peanuts thinking they would be safe, I wish I could take that decision back."
Baguio Night Market,Clothes and other pasalubong
Baguio Night Market,It's crowded during the holidays but that understandable. It is a good place where you can find good deals for cheap clothes and merchandises. I was able to try the food but that is ok there will be another time for that. ❤️
Baguio Night Market,"If you're looking for a really good deal, low price yet good quality, this is the place for you. Located at Harrison Rd, this night market starts at 9pm. A bit crowdy on weekends. It's better to go early since you can choose the good items first and haggle as their ""Buena Mano"" or first sale. They have food stalls on one end of the night market near the overpass. If you're picky, this place is not for you, but if you like to haggle and look for great finds, this place is a treasure trove! Beware of pickpockets though! Always put your belongings inside your bag and your bag in front of you."
Baguio Night Market,"The variety of stuff like foods, garments, pasalubongs, etc is overwhelming! If you are craving for street foods and cheap clothings, this is the best place for you to go. They open at 9pm :)"
Baguio Night Market,"If you're on a tight budget but wanted to take advantage of surplus or ukay2 goods abroad, then this is the place to be! I was able to buy winter clothes for as low as 50pesos for kids and 100 pesos for adults!"
Baguio Night Market,"Usually a crowd builds up for the night market where one can find cheap second-hand clothing, shoes and other knick-knacks. Be sure to bring umbrellas as weather in Baguio is quite unpredictable. A jacket is also a good idea as it can get rather chilly at nights in Baguio. An be on the lookout for pickpockets!"
Baguio Night Market,"When malls are closed and you feel you want some more shopping. Since it is usually full of people, you are reminded to place your wallets in your front pockets, and bags as well to prevent pickpocketers from being tempted."
Baguio Night Market,Super nice experience in bagui with my lovely bebe  😘
Baguio Night Market,"You can buy affordable used slightly cloths, shoes, bags, even street foods at night time."
Baguio Night Market,The products and displays are very good and sometimes very rare but the crowd is too much for a very narrowed walkway along the selling area. You could not stay in one vendor for a long time becuase of the queus from a lot of people.
Baguio Night Market,Baguio Night Market is great! Mostly ukay-ukays are the top products here.
Baguio Night Market,"Souvenirs were more expensive, better to go to mines view or botanical garden for cheap souvenirs. Everything is 2nd hand around 50 to 100 pesos smells very old like attic. Food is ok just basic street foods. Fishballs and corns, shawarma and mami. Not recommended when raining specially if your over 5ft there will be cords everywhere."
Baguio Night Market,"This place offers best street food. They have awesome Shawarma, chicken skin, corn with cheese and butter, pancake and even Korean street food! they start to setup around 9pm while Ukay Ukay follows until 2am."
Baguio Night Market,Nice
Baguio Night Market,"Late Night open, Not good"
Baguio Night Market,"Went here just for the street foods hoping that we will be able to find local foods and some korean foods (which we did!). The place is so crowded. It resembles a flea market.If you are looking for a place to buy cheap clothes and accessories, this is the right place. Be mindful of pickpockets in the area.The place is near Hotel Veniz in front of Burnham Park. The street foods are beside Igorot Park and near the footbridge."
Baguio Night Market,Night market in Baguio is amazing a lot of clothes to buy a lot of amazing people to meet a good place to relax.To everyone who visited night market I hope you all enjoyed and had fun while roaming around the street.
Baguio Night Market,Lots of cool stuff to buy. Cheap but usable better than class A
Baguio Night Market,"The fascinating thing is you'll start from the food section with various food choices that they sell and then you'll walk through the section where they sell imitation brands and usually sell preloved stuff like shoes, jackets, and even souvenirs in a very affordable price, me and my friends been in this place for twice when we we're in Baguio and I hope that says a lot already."
Baguio Night Market,A mist visit when in baguio 😁👌
Baguio Night Market,"Only two rows of stalls were installed, arrows were placed for the direction of shoppers thus avoiding congestion, unlike before the night market today was very organized."
Baguio Night Market,The night market is too jam-packed so be ready. There are a lot of stalls that offers affordable jackets and shoes but you have to be keen and patient checking them.
Baguio Night Market,When it comes to quality over quantity Bagiuo Night Market give you a shot. Starting on undergarments to sweatshirts to hoodies or jackets you can buy everything here for just like 150 and below (some are buy 1 take 1)
Baguio Night Market,"Too crowded. You literally don't have to take a single step cause the wave of peope wil lead you anyways lol. If you're eyeing for cheap finds, this is not the best place coz not everything is cheap plus you'll get all stressed out due to too much crowd. You won't even have a decent sight on the items you're looking at."
Baguio Night Market,"Wide options of thrifty items from accessories, shoes, clothes, bags and even food. Definitely a must on your itinerary, specially if you love shopping. 👌🏼"
Baguio Night Market,You can find so many things to buy
Baguio Night Market,"Lots of local food here, and if you want to strike streets food  grab it here with a punch of taste ness"
Baguio Night Market,First time to go here and I love it. You just have to be patience and  use your eagle eyes to spot for the best deal clothes for super affordable price.I got one pull over for Php 50 and Uniqlo Jacket for just Php 150 :)
Baguio Night Market,crowded! crowded!! and crowded!!! never go here with lot of money or just best to put your money on a safe place.. a super safe place.. to be honest there are lot of pickpockets here so take care of your belongings.. but you can find almost everything here overall not bad better to see your self
Baguio Night Market,"Have been here 3x in 3 years and i must say it hasnt changed. I still found the stalls that sell slippers, fleece blankets and pillows, and native woodcrafts. However, like most Philippine night markets, you will find imitation brands of shoes, bags, and electronic products here. It would have been good if this night market can also turn into a food night market like that of Taiwan. Lastly, this isnt the place for you if you have no patience for people who push and shove like there's no tomorrow."
Baguio Night Market,"Bought jackets that were decent with brands at 150 pesos, it is worth a travel from metro 😁"
Baguio Night Market,where you can buy 2nd hand branded clothings
Baguio Night Market,"If ever you plan in going to night market, you better hold your bag infront of you. Be careful as well coz there are human trafficking even though theres a lot of people, asbi heard from rumors.Buy then you can enjoy buying some goods but the food is not that satisfying coz some of the foods are cold and the weather is cold as well.  You cant help looking for some warm to eat."
Baguio Night Market,"Baguio Night Market as of December 23, 2021"
Baguio Night Market,Tried strawberry 🍓 taho for the 1st timeIt was great
Baguio Night Market,"Flea market that attracts all kinds of people -from locals to tourists. A lot of bargain deals. You can get wag-wag (pre-owned stuff) and brand new items here, from shoes, bags and even toys. Can get too crowded at times so plan accordingly"
Baguio Night Market,"The best place for people who loves ukay-ukay! There's a lot to choose from. From bags, dresses, pants, shorts and shoes. There are also food stalls like fish cakes (korean street food). Wear comfortable shoes cause you'll be tired of walking."
Baguio Night Market,Looking for night shopping? @baguios night market you'll find cheaply priced clothings etc
Baguio Night Market,It's a market place at night.

I don't know about hygiene here thouh, you just have to be picky and eat at your own risk. I've tried squidballs and the like, luckily nothing happened. Worth to try!"
Baguio Night Market,"Its a place to visit at night in Baguio. A busy road at the corner of Burnham Park that will turn into a market at 9pm to 3am. 9pm-11pm are the peak hours so there are really lots of people that time. The main products there are dry goods esp cheap 2nd hand clothes and shoes, street foods, phones and other  accesories."

Baguio Night Market,"Great place for strolling and shopping in the heart of Baguio city. When you're tired, you can enjoy various street foods. Then, you may relax at the nearby hotels in the city!"
Baguio Night Market,Night market is the highlight at night in downtown area. You can grab local foods or buy stuffs you may need for daily use. Most products are used so expect them to be cheap.
Baguio Night Market,Very nice view
Baguio Night Market,"This is one of the highlights of Baguio City. Every night, harrison road is closed to allow vendors to sell their goods overnight. It’s crowded, packed with people but there are great items sold at cheap prices."
Baguio Night Market,Good place to shop and eat.
Baguio Night Market,"CHEAPEST ITEMS BEING SOLD IN THIS MARKET! Everyone should atleast give it a visit when going to Baguio. A lot of buyers visit it at night so I recommend going at the middle of their opening hours. Everything sold at 100, 50php, 25php, and even 10php!!!"
Baguio Night Market,"Baguio Night Market. (FOODEVERTHANKFUL)One of the most famous attractions in Baguio City is the Night Market along Harrison Road just beside Burnham Park. At around 9:00 in the evening, the southbound side of Harrison Road is closed until around 2:00 am. During this time, merchants come from all over to sell their goods, from clothes to shoes, accessories to cheap-but-still-elegant jackets, and of course, street foods.What can you buy in the street food area? Well, our favorites were the grilled barbecues. They’re only P5 per stick and you can choose from pork barbecue, pork skin, chicken intestines, pig intestines, Betamax (pork liver squares), Adidas (chicken feet) and more. There are lots of vendors who sell these too so you’re not bound to just one of them. I also love eating corn and there are a lot of vendors who have them. You can either have them on a stick, shredded and buttered and have them eaten in a cup.There are more foods to choose from such as sandwiches, noodles, mini-convenience store item and there are even those that serve meals on-the-go. Since we were there during Christmas and New Year holidays, there were some seasonal foods such as bibingka and puto bumbong. Fruits can also be bought here.Drinks are also available, but I think per our observation, alcoholic drinks aren’t allowed. We don’t drink alcoholic beverages anyway so we didn’t look for them. We loved the bottled sodas as the spirit, as we call it, is so strong, you really feel the undiluted thirst-quenching cold carbonated drink down your throat.Most of them should be clean though, especially when they’re properly cooked. And most especially, the food is not that expensive. Well, at least most of them are cheaper compared to what we have here in Manila. It’s not that significant, but your P50 will go a long way. The meal sets that sell for P100 in most of Metro Manila’s street food bazaars, or some banchettos, would be roughly around P75 here or so. That’s just a personal observation and analysis. Prices are quite volatile in food bazaars.There are a few things that you need to take note of, however. The smoke from the grills is quite thick and if you have breathing problems or is easily irritated by smoke, you should stay away from that area. Don’t worry though, every night, Baguio City’s brave firefighters are on standby near the street food area should their help be needed. Beware of pickpockets as well since the food stalls are tightly packed and there are just too many people around.Another thing you need to brace for is the sheer number of people buying street foods. You can hardly walk around because people are packed, queuing for their orders to be taken or while they are waiting for the orders to be prepared. You’ll surely bump into one another as you pass through the different food stalls. After we got out orders, we stayed outside the selling area and stood near the firefighters and their fire truck. Then we went back and ordered some more and took them up to our hotel room.If you’re in Baguio City, it’s a great experience to go to the night market and buy street foods. It’s like part of the culture. Just be wary of what you’ll buy since there are some exotic foods that you don’t usually find in restaurants and supermarkets. Mind your allergies as well.But overall, as a tourist, it’s quite fun mingling with people who love street food. With the cold weather, especially since it’s in the evening, the great food and the upbeat people, Baguio City’s Night Market is another must-go-to place for tourists and even locals alike."

Baguio Night Market,The Baguio night market is similar to Manila's tsiangian but with limited items and the things that can be bought here can usually be bought in Manila give or take a few souvenir items.They also sell ukay ukay stuff and some food.

Baguio Night Market,Just remember that the night market starts at around 8pm. We arrived at 6pm and just saw the vendors setting up. Haha. Good thing it is near/beside the Burnham park. The ukay-ukay selection is superb.
Baguio Night Market,This is the spot to shop if you a hayopbeast jk night Market in Harrison is a nightly tradition lots of cheap o thing accessories and many more.

Baguio Night Market,Great selections at crazy rock bottom prices!A must-go when you are in Baguio City!
Baguio Night Market,"Vendors usually start packing up by 1130pm and will be gone just before midnight but their regular hours are until midnight according to locals. There's a wide range of goods here. You can find clothes, gadgets, shoes, bags, personal effects and food. The food section has diverse interesting offerings, those that you won't normally get with other ukayan food hubs, probably because of tourists from all sorts of places. Thr small microfiber blanket that you can buy in Divisoria for P120 costs P200-P250 here.Baguio is a total no-smoking city. The night market is no exception. Just don't light up to avoid being apprehended by local police."
Baguio Night Market,"It's fun in a way because the night is lively. Weather is cold and its a relief from the heat in Manila. Pretty small place. Everything is walking distance. There are not much jeepneys in the area. You need to get taxi to go around but if you just wanted to explore the town you can just walk. There's a lot in night Market. But nothing extra ordinary. If you visied other night market in the philippines, its like that. Nothing new aside from 'endless ukay-ukay'. But there are locals who would take advantage of you if they know you are a tourist. Which is bad for the country and bad for the tourism industry. People will not come again if they have bad experience coming here."
Baguio Night Market,"It's a bit overrated. The selections are fine but all the items are the same, just a different vendor. Ok din yung pagkain. The typical cheap and sakto-sa-panlasang kanto food."
Baguio Night Market,Nothing special. Only the food
Baguio Night Market,"Its like an ordinary place, anyhow, take a good care of your belongings, not only in metro manila culprits are watching but to any crowded places where they could take a chance. And as much as possible.. go in groups."

Baguio Night Market,"VERY VERY CHEAP FINDSDefinitely one of the highlights in our trip to Baguio.

In buying, you need to be very keen in scrutinizing goods like clothes you buy because its dark and the light is yellow colored- this sometimes hide imperfections like stains and the clothe quality may not be well assessed."
Baguio Night Market,Baguio night market is where you haggle for affordable prices of various high quality items. Street food is abundant. Just bring your umbrella during the rainy season.

Baguio Night Market,"Its a very bad experience,there is no police desk, so if a kid got lost there's a very small chance of finding the kid"
Wright Park,"₱250/30minutes to ride a horse with a guide is not bad at all. The kids loved it. The guide was courteous, Kuya Rolly. The stroll around The Mansion and the mirror pool was my fave. The area had bike lanes and the paid restroom area had a landscaped zen like garden and was so clean. The whole area was clean and the lark was well kept. The pool had fishes on it. A few meters walk down towards botanical was a steak place you can wind down on, they have . Pine Country Steaks and Waffles! Highly recommended!"
Wright Park,Never fails to be mesmerizing. It's my 5th time to be here and I still enjoy going here. Nice to help local tourist spot and help boost their economy. Specially the ones that are striving to for it. If you love nature come here. But make sure it's the weekdays because weekends produce the most populous days to travel.
Wright Park,Part of Wright Park is under renovation. Love the view of many horses big and small. Also appreciate the efforts and presence of vendors around the park for more convenient tour. A thirty minute horseback riding is worth P300.
Wright Park,"When I was 8 yrs old we went to Baguio for a trip with my family. I wanted my child to have the same experiences and memories. Wright Park had more flowers more than 20 yrs ago. It was more beautiful. Now, even the trees are sparse and the water looks like its extremely murky. Nonetheless, I hope my boy holds these memories as precious as I hold my memories of Baguio when I was young."
Wright Park,"It is less crowded during the pandemic so we get to enjoy the park more.Great place to pass time, unwind and just to enjoy the beautiful scenery."
Wright Park,"This is where people visit for a horseback riding. As expected, there are many horses available but most of them seem unwell so we didn't tried to ride one. We just let the kid to experience it. They offer photo op with the horse and you just have to pay 50 pesos. The smell is quite not nice but understandable."
Wright Park,Nostalgic. Wright park is divided into 2. Upper and lower. The lower part is the horse backriding. The ride is 250/ 30minutes. I recommend camp john Hay if you want to horse backride because the space is limitedThe upper part is great. It is just across the Mansion. Make sure to take a photo at the long pond/reflection
Wright Park,"Ig worthy place. The fishes are cute, they all stop moving for a while. It's nice to take pictures here and also just a very refreshing place to explore. Bring a thicker mask or handkerchief because it stinks in the horse-riding area."
Wright Park,Kids enjoyed riding a horse around the city. P500/ head. Plus tip to your kuya tour guide. 😉
Wright Park,My kids enjoyed their time on top of their horses. We were the only one's in the park and we loves it.
Wright Park,"Just right.. for we need to cool up, we're family from Alaminos City Pangasinan.. hot place always and it is indeed a good chance to visit Baguio City 💖💖🎉"
Wright Park,"You can ride horses and see beautiful horses. Beside from that the ambiance is no goods, the trees and plants are refreshing. There’s not much to do"
Wright Park,"So nice to walk en the surrounding so refreshing and nice to my eyes en the weather too I want to back again ,the only one I say is thank God for the wonderful place He create for us"
Wright Park,The horse riding is a good experience for kids. Family oriented venue. Requires active physical activities.
Wright Park,The park is exceptionally serene and beautiful during non-peak hours. The amenities and gardens here are also dutifully maintained.
Wright Park,"Wright park is good for long walks, jogging, biking, breathing fresh air and smelling that pine tree breezed air.Cleanliness is maintained.Pet friendly.Budget friendly stores selling souvenirs.Horseriding activity.And lastly, that iconic huge dog where you can have tour picture taken with him for only Php50.00 (unli shots)."
Wright Park,We visit here around 5 pm it's not crowded since the park is about to close. We just took some photo and leave.
Wright Park,During our visit there was no flowers although the area is clean and well maintained.
Wright Park,"Very nice to loiter around,  not so crowded at this time. We had great fun!"
Wright Park,"I would suggest to go horse  back riding at camp john hay insteadThey have improved the trail but I would just personally recommend to do this at camp john hay :)Btw be mindful of the time, it is the 2nd time where we experienced the guide telling us that time is up even though we're just half way through our paid time. 🙄"
Wright Park,Kids enjoyed the Horseback ride. laughter from the kids is priceless...
Wright Park,"You can see the place is well maintained and cared by the city and its people. The grass are trimmed, no trash onsite and vendors have their own alley. They allow you to take pictures close enough but not too closed. Regular people do not have access to the mansion itself unless they are probable invited on special occasions."
Wright Park,you can never go wrong with Wright Park. emz😁😊
Wright Park,Prepare your knees for the few steps 😅 better start from The Mansion to Wright Park. Where you can ride the horses.
Wright Park,"I have to say, we enjoyed the whole trekking! ♥️"
Wright Park,"Just the smell. But he park is nice. Try to find the hidden grassy area right side of the park. Quiet, and grassy, good place to do a picnic on."
Wright Park,Some parts are still under construction. But you can enjoy horseback riding and taking pictures. There are souvenir shops in the area and food stalls. With pay comfort rooms.
Wright Park,Great place to take walks or bike ❤️
Wright Park,"Take time to relax on this park, after can do horsebackriding or go all the way to Mansion House"
Wright Park,Nothings special just horseback riding/ taking photo with igorot costume and doggie and grotto at the top if you are fan of it then its your area where to visit.
Wright Park,Great scenery and clean comfort room
Wright Park,Great for morning runs. There are still plenty of pine trees.
Wright Park,This place has a lot to offer than my photo can tell 😁
Wright Park,"Amazing Experience riding  Horse, i am not ok by the smell of the  though, you can smell the urine of horses. But the experience and the peoples there are amazing"
Wright Park,"This park is perfect for those who are soul-searching or simply just want to escape from the loud city. Ideal place for a walk, meditation, relaxation and more."
Wright Park,I highly suggest to go here in the morning to enjoy the park and its cold climate. Its always a plus for me when one can enjoy the place without that much noise.There are beautiful flowers (but no picking). It is known for horseback riding and photo opportunity with dogs like Beethoven!
Wright Park,"This place is a must if you want to experience riding a horse and strolling in it within the vicinity. From the park, the Mansion is also accessible from here by foot through the stairs.The smell of horses and its dung is strong so for those who probably can not take it, just be ready and bring masks or towels."
Wright Park,"Finally got to enjoy this place lately as a Baguio local because it's been one of the most peaceful places during quarantine (since john hay is only open during sundays). Good for dog walks especially the trail, jogging, biking, skating and any other leisure. I haven't visited this place for several years as it gets easily flocked by tourists. Feels good to enjoy our own home!"
Wright Park,"A nice place to hang around upon visiting The Mansion. Lots of treat and souvenir to choose from. It has a wide space for horseback riding,  traditional attires to wear for picture taking, and of course, the cool weather to enjoy more the scene. However, there are undisciplined people who keep on throwing their trash anywhere they desire."
Wright Park,Here is a nice place to take a stroll and enjoy the surroundings. With great views and perfect weather you can enjoy spending some time here. I found there to be plenty of food options sweet and savour. Theres a chance to explore on horseback for a small fee. It can get busy here. With a short walk to the end of the park you will see the mansion this really is a well kept clean area. Take some great pictures with friends or family or even a quick selfie.
Wright Park,"The pine trails is a nice addition, specially if there are only few people visiting.  Please keep it like that and don't over develop."
Wright Park,"Park right in front of The Mansion, the place  I found very interesting as fog would descend every now and then when I visited this place. Lined with pines and other conifers. Photo opportunities for local costumes and a fine St. Bernard dog were some of the other interesting things found there."
Wright Park,"Composed of two spots one by the long rectangular pond full of fish located in front of the Mansion House and the other where you see the famous horse back riding area of Wright park. This place is perfect for taking photos, a leisurely walk or horseback riding. A gazebo is also found here where you can sit relax and watch the people walk by."
Wright Park,"A cool and nice park ideal for family and groups. One of the tourist destinations that is a must to visit when you are in Baguio. Make sure to bring your food and snacks. You can enjoy the cool breeze and the nature, it's full of green. As always, tends to get crowded during holidays, xmas and new year season."
Wright Park,"A good park. Needs to be preserved. The st. Bernard dog which has a photo op has not been taken well cared off and it costs more than the st. Bernard dog which is seen on the lions head, it stinks too. The thing that i dont like is that they let cars park inside the park. It would have been better if only people would walk around"
Wright Park,"Very beautiful place; enough parking space (free, they only asked for donation); horseback riding rate 500 plus guide 500, total of 1k, park kinda smells (bcoz of d horses 😂), u can try traditional igorot clothes and take unlimited pictures for 20 only!"
Wright Park,"Good for sight seeing, horseback riding and enjoying nature. Great place also to try there native costumes😍. Walking distance from the mansion and a few Kilometer from mines view."
Wright Park,Added a walk in Wright Park in our quick getaway with friends in Baguio. It was nice and we took some great scenic pictures.
Wright Park,"Wright Park beams with some of Baguio's gorgeous flowers. If you are a flower enthusiast, drop by to this public park and you'd surely enjoy the scenery. One can also ride horses for 300 pesos for 30 minutes. Also try the strawberry flavored taho if you catch a peddler!"
Wright Park,nice place to take pictures
Wright Park,Nice place to visit. Love the tress it gives comfort to relax your inner self.
Wright Park,I've been living here in Baguio for a couple years now but this is the first time I've been here. This is like a very different place compared to Burnham Park and Rose Garden where I always go. Very nice views and refreshing environment. Luckily we still have these kinds of parks here in Baguio where there are a lot of trees. There's also a high staircase where you need to climb and be rewarded by very beautiful sceneries.
Wright Park,"it's actually my first time in Baguio and I don't have any regret in giving this cold city a chance. climate is superb, travel is good and just right. this park offers a lot of opportunity for tourists and locals alike. tall trees, amazing flowers, friendly locals. you got it all. you also get to wear their indigenous costumes (replica of course) and take unlimited pics for only 20 pesos (0.25 USD). that's superb! they also have this hgmuge st. bernard dog waiting for your loving arms and warm hugs and of course, the cool souvenirs you can buy almost anywhere in the park."
Wright Park,"Cool place, love to walk around"
Wright Park,A popular tourist destination in Baguio just in front of The Mansion. Nice to walk around with the view of tall trees and the feel of chilly air. Food stalls are available for a quick bite in case you got hungry. Hot noodles are perfect for the cold weather. You can have photo opt with the horses and this St Martin dog for a fee of 50 to 100 pesos.
Wright Park,"Absolutely nice! Noe they have Igorot Costumes, St Bernard Dog and the ambiance is relaxing. Try to go at the Wright's park circle and go downstairs for the horse ride."
Wright Park,I've been here a couple of times and til now this place stinks due to horse manure. The side of the park is under renovation as of now though. If you feel like riding horses while in Baguio then this is the right place. It's also near the Mansion so you just need to climb up the steep stairs.
Wright Park,"The surroundings are well kept, relaxing as usual...except on weekends where people are all over the place."
Wright Park,The view is relaxing and my kids enjoyed the horse back ride. The guide even taught my kid how to ride on his own. I was able to buy plants at an affordable price
Wright Park,If you want to experience horse back riding. This is the place for you. Igorot costume is also cheaper here by 5 php compared to mines view. It's just across the mansion so it's like hitting 2 birds woth one stone. Enjoy your trip 😊
Wright Park,Horse riding is the number one attraction here but there is a lot of things to do here too.There is cactus and succulent on the side. The good stairs which is great site for IG picture. Dirty Ice Cream strawberry flavor is a must try.
Wright Park,"So pretty. Horses to ride. Stairs to climb. Trails to explore. Not overly crowded, most of the time. Really nice."
Wright Park,A good place to do walking. The view is good too for nature lovers.
Wright Park,If you want to go to 2 places at almost the same time...go here.The Mansion is just accross the Wright parkYou could take a chance to have a photo op with st bernard dogs. Price per head is 50 pesos. 2 other dogs are located inside the park which might be cheaper. Also horseback riding activity is available. For those who want plants there are also stores here. Restaurant also available like Volante pizza and pasta. Shakeys is also near
Wright Park,"Place where cheaper Cacti,Compare to Mines view.Best part is you can always bargain specially on bulk purchases.The place came back to life as of today,It's a good to see that thing's are somehow back to normal,And Business as usual now that Baguio is on alert level 1April 14' 2022."
Wright Park,"Nice place to go to when you want a day out to just relax, go biking, walking & do a lot of stuff just to pass the time during weekends."
Wright Park,"A best place to go when visiting baguio. The ambience is good, the park it self is very wonderful and it's cold (of course it's in Baguio) that's why it's so nice to walk around. Don't mind the smell in there. 😅"
Wright Park,"Near the mansion house, so its ok to visit. Another big park with horses and natural things, a good place to both sightseeing and exercise since you have to walk down a long and high steps."
Wright Park,I jog here every morning. Very peaceful except on weekends when the tourist crowd arrives. Otherwise this place is tranquil.
Wright Park,"Good place, Good view. Few shops of variety. Few motorcycle parking space."
Wright Park,"Not much to visit but has a fare amount of area's to visit, very relaxing except for the hundred step and taking a picture of yourself with your background is the mansion."
Wright Park,Nice garden views all around. Have some strawberry or ube taho or ice cream sandwich from the vendors. The seedless sagada oranges are sweet and pleasant so have a go at the free taste slice being offered. Buy some for take home too.
Wright Park,"Situated right in front of the Mansion House; It's always relaxing to take a stroll at the Wright Park; Enjoyed the cold weather, smelled the fresh scent of the pine trees, took pictures with the ""famous"" dog (forgot its name) and with Igorot costumes on, and ate Starwberry Taho. The Pool of Pines (rectangular body of water at the center), though, needs cleaning."
Wright Park,"The usual tourist place to visit in Baguio city. If you are getting hungry, you can visit bulalohan (mama sitas) across the wright park. They are saying the parking is free if you dine in mama sitas but they are charging 50 pesos upon exit. ;) Still food are good."
Wright Park,"It was fun for kids with the horseback riding and for the old ladies too for the plants, flowers, souvenirs and silver accessories for sale. Taho with strawberry syrup is available here too and it is a must try."
Wright Park,"The Wright Park is one of the major and easily identifiable tourist destination in Baguio City, all because of the horses - a lot of horses. Sure there are other spots in the city of pines that offer horse rides but the Wright Park offers a lot of choices - from purebreeds to pygmies, from pure black stallions to pink donkeys (or sort of). You name it they'll get one for you."
Wright Park,"Wright ParkWright Park is a beautiful small park located in lush green scenic area of Baguio, Philippines. It is named after American Governor Luke Wright. It is adorned with a long reflecting pool lined with pine tree which gives mesmerizing beauty to the Park. An additional charm to the Park is the facility of pony ride and horse racing competition. Right in front of the Park is the Summer House of the President of Philippines called “The Mansion”."
Wright Park,Nice elevated park
Wright Park,"I love the horses! I got my horse at only 350 pesos. I think the regular price is 400 or above (pardon me, I forgot). You can either choose where you want to go. Other guides needed to be paid but I got ours at free hehe. Just use some pacute tactics to them 😂"
Wright Park,It's nice to visit the place when the weather is good. And a good thing I've noticed is that they've improved the part where you can go around horseback riding.
Wright Park,"Just right across the Mansion House. Great park for a stroll. If you care for horsebackriding, this is the place for you! There's an area where one could rent a horse plus a guide, and test their haggling and riding skills! 😉"
Wright Park,"This place is too relaxing and it's good to do exercising like jogging,Zumba,yoga etc."
Wright Park,"A place good for picture taking of families, relatives and loved ones. With the green background, your pictures will definitely be an Instagramable. Visit now and enjoy!"
Wright Park,"Awesome place friendly people. Pick your horse wisely. Mine had flat, smooth shoes so it slid many times on pavement.  I chose 1 hour city horseback ride but returned after 1/2 mile up the street. I walked back with my horse. It also had a limp. Not worth getting hurt. I could tell the horse was in pain. I still paid 1 hour price to be fair. Took different horse in park."
Wright Park,"Unlike in the 80s Wright Park now is Jammed with cars, & vendors.The horses seem underweight. But its still Wright Park where the kids can learn & enjoy horseback riding You can nrever go wrong visiting this place  Still love it ! ."
Wright Park,"It is a nice park. You can do horse back riding, sight seeing, there are a lot of flower/plant shops all over the place, souvenier booths, and booths where you can try on one of Philippines native tribe clothing, the Kambal and Divit or Tapis of the IGOROT."
Wright Park,"A very good place to visit, weather is just fine,very accommodating, people enjoy sight seeing,well maintained restrooms, Parkings are available"
Wright Park,Beautiful park. Very neat and clean. Ganda mag family portraits/pictures.
Wright Park,Scenic as always. Good thing we went there when the crowd was not big so there're not a lot of photobombers.
Wright Park,I love the view in here. Those who love nature and calm place. This is best one.
Wright Park,"Baguio City will always be my favorite place simply because of the climate. There are lots of tourist spots to roam around too. The parks, spa's, foodies , museum and many more. Will definitely be back here soon with friends. 😍"
Wright Park,"Its nice to visit this place for your morning jogs and morning walk, not crowded and you can even bring your kids here to let them have fun as well, the pond have big koi's and tilapias which attracts the children"
Wright Park,"Choose monday to friday for tour ,less ang tourist"
Wright Park,Without the usual deluge of tourists Wright Park is actually quite beautiful.  Perfect place to go for a run or just stroll with your kids.But the usual tourists it can get quite chaotic with cars and vans parked everywhere with bonus exhaust from vehicles idling coz its passengers want to enjoy their aircon in the cool Baguio climate :)
Wright Park,Gorgeous park. I loved the part in front of the mansion. The one at the horses are kinda smells so you can't fully enjoy the place.
Wright Park,We walk here everyday. It's really peaceful and such a great place
Wright Park,Century old Baguio's public park. Maintains its historical and original structure.  Neat and fresh air atmosphere.
Wright Park,"The smell of horses can be intimidating but once you get on the top part, there's a good view waiting for you."
Wright Park,I like it better than mines view...near the mansion and you can do horse pack riding. View is nice. Good for photo ops
Wright Park,"I wish they would take more care of the animals and land surrounding them, please don't litter here and make sure to always respect the people around you. Lovely place outside of tourist hours, otherwise a little overcrowded."
Wright Park,"Places with water element is very attractive and refreshing.  That plus the cold weather of Baguio City tells me to come back and create different memories each time I return. During this visit, I had my first taste of strawberry taho here."
Wright Park,"You can experience a horse back riding here in an affordable price, reach the top and walk for a few minutes and you can reach The Mansion"
Wright Park,Cool and Nice place to rest. Challenge is where to park your vehicle.
Wright Park,"Went here around 6:30am, perfect for jogging and do some exercise since its not yet crowded. You can enjoy the view while running ❤"
Wright Park,"Beautiful. A lot of stories about  presidents and from staff around this place, expect traffic especially on weekends. Parking is a bit hard."
Wright Park,We go to jog or walk here every now and then because it's just nearby our place. Both locals and tourist come here to do there morning walks. Everyone can enjoy the view and enjoy the fresh air of the City of Pines.
Wright Park,'twas a nice experience 😍
Wright Park,Did I come during the wrong season? The water is very dirty. This place would look amazing if the water was clear with fish swimming around it.
Wright Park,My son's first time to ride a horse and it was awesome to see his smile. Its a must see place for anyone going to Baguio.
Wright Park,Nothing too special about it in my opinion. Wouldn't say its a must see. Just a nice place to chill and walk around.
Wright Park,Beautiful spacious park with lots of chairs and tables where you can have a picnic with your family. It's quite maintained considering its clean inspite of many tourist coming everyday. Many shops around where you can try to bargain as some sellers were already doing for us even before we asked.Just hope they will add more thrash bins.
Wright Park,Clean and well treated place. Has a lot of tourists. Definitely wants to come back for the 3rd time. lolNo restaurants nearby. The place is accessible even in commute. 😁
Wright Park,Great place if you want horse back riding
Wright Park,"Good place for families to walk, talk, shop souvenirs, check out paintings for sale and strawberry ice cream!"
Wright Park,the park is suitable for idyllic walks on Sunday mornings.
Wright Park,"The Mansion is not open for the public yet due to the current implementation of GCQ (February 1 to 28, 2021) but you can take photos of the place outside the property gate. No crowd of tourist as the Baguio Government reduce the tourist capacity and strict requirements before entering the city.  Capturing using Samsung Note 20 Ultra and follow me in IG:_master_jay_"
Wright Park,Great time to run there on a Sunday. Not much crowd so you can run your phone better.On Saturdays they have like zumba class.The location and the weather is ideal for physical activites.
Wright Park,"I know that horses are a huge part of Baguio's culture, but I saw some handlers not treating them nicely. I don't think that painting their hair is necessary as well.There were also two St. Bernards at the park where you have to pay P50 for photo shoots with them. The dogs were forced to behave or pose to look at the camera. It seems like they're stressed or tired.Though the park itself is an average place for me. The surrounding smells bad though."
Wright Park,Well worth the visit. Lots to see n do.great clean facilities
Wright Park,Good place to visit if you are first time in Baguio but not much to see. Make sure to go early because it gets crowded.
Wright Park,It was underwhelming. The photos looked great but the park needs better maintenance.
Wright Park,Nice place for quick chillout (not so big). At another site you can see and visit the Mansion
Wright Park,"It's where you'll finally experience the horse back riding. Though the smell isn't good cause of the horses but the experience of meeting them is face to face is great. Like you'll literally rub elbows with them. With the locals they are very nice specially to the sales rep of the store where i bought my jacket. I've seen a lot of souvenir,pasalubong and ukay-ukay shops inside the park."
Wright Park,"It's fun riding horses here but the smell slightly stinks but if you have a very sensitive nose you should bring face mask or rather I don't recommend you too go here. They also offer a ride from wright park to minesview. Though the prices are high, the service is very good."
Wright Park,Ride a horse and take a pic with igorot costume to help the community.
Wright Park,It's a healing to my eyes to see green and clean environment. Breathing the cool breeze scent from pinetrees.
Wright Park,Maganda yung place.  You should drop by.
Wright Park,"Good view for picture taking, lots of products selling and safe area for kids."
Wright Park,🐎
Wright Park,We just got lucky we got a parking spot but otherwise its really crowded.. traffic is bad..plus it was raining when we're o. The site..
Wright Park,"Wright Park is right across The Mansion.  It has horses for rent.  It's a clean place to walk,  relax and enjoy the marvelous sceneries.  :-)"
Wright Park,"Way back in 2016, I had my first horseback riding in this park and I enjoyed it a lot."
Wright Park,Great place to stroll around however the kids didn't get a chance to ride the horse as it started to rain.
Wright Park,"Horseback ride is what Wright Park is known for. Until now, they don’t have sort of proper viewing deck waiting area for parents. P250 for 30mins is what I paid 4/10/19 seems reasonable. While they are more organized now, there are still some “scalpers” that will approach you.The starting point for the Baguio Grotto can also be found in this park.If you are quite adventurous you can request the jockey to ride with your son / daughter so that the horse will gallop and I’m sure he / she will enjoy the ride more."
Wright Park,The place is clean and good though the only discouraging part is the park now full with vendor with surge prices of goods :(
Wright Park,Ah perfect place to relax and feel the nature. ♥️
Wright Park,"Yes,  my visitors from the U. S enjoyed the pink horse. This is a perfect place to enjoy your stay in Baguio."
Wright Park,Great place to experience horse back riding. Walking distance from Botanical Garden and to Mansion.
Wright Park,Can be found easily through map.
Wright Park,"The location is just across the Mansion on the side of the street. You can also find here the popular saint Bernard dog and have pictures for 20php.The places is clean and there are also store where you can buy snacks and souvenirs. And of course the most popular activity in this place is Horseback riding, in which horses are colored artificially.There are also extra activity like using Ita costumes and take photo for 20php you can choose your own outfit and accessories.There is a magtataho walking around if you want a taste of their strawberry taho."
Wright Park,Tourist should know how to throw their garbage at the designated garbage bin to preserve the beauty of the ace.
Wright Park,Wright park is the best place to take your kids.They have colorful horses which remind me of pony(unicorn)  big fluffy dogs😍Walking distance from the mansion if ur taking the stairs. Just across the street.
Wright Park,A very wide place to play with your skate board. And a lot of people to compete with. Nearby restaurants are nice.
Wright Park,"Dont forget to Ride the ""Pamosong"" Horse backriding , and Visit the Mansion. There's A lot activity that you can do as well."
Wright Park,"For those looking to ride a horse or have yet experienced riding one, it's your chance to do it iwhile in Baguio. Aside from that, that's it... Place is a bit small juat going around the circle while on the horse. Food is reasonably priced. Parking is ok. Visit during off peak season to get the full experience"
Wright Park,Nice place to walk around with your loved ones while  having a zip of strawberry taho
Wright Park,Still love the place. Quiet and clean!
Wright Park,Site to visit in Baguio City
Wright Park,Nice place for horseback riding. It's at P250 per 30 minutes and your kids can experience this activity with a guide. Rate as of February 2020.
Wright Park,A good place to stroll. Mansion is just across the street while the horse back riding is down the flight of stairs in the park.
Wright Park,The kids specially can really enjoy this place because of its cold temperature and a lot of horses to choose from.
Wright Park,Great place for horse back riding and picture taking
Wright Park,Place is okay its best if little people are visiting tey early in the morning
Wright Park,Nice park with lots of good spot for picture taking... Love the strawberry taho as well.Kid's friendly and have a nice horse riding facility!
Wright Park,Very accessible from city proper & only place in Baguio  to enjoy awesome  horse back riding.
Wright Park,The trees were tall and big but there's.nothing much of a greenery surrounding.The grass were partly dead and need some rehabilitation I think.
Wright Park,Very good scenery but smells like horse dung
Wright Park,The most obvious mark of this park is the smell of horse dung. Activites like horseback riding and horse picture taking are offered.
Wright Park,This place is crowded with peole and cars during weekend..better go there on weekdays😉
Wright Park,There was still construction work ongoing but the park itself was okay
Wright Park,"its nice having a social distancing and nice place , quite fresh air."
Wright Park,"Far less congested with joggers as compared to well-visited burnham park early in the morning. In addition, less cars fumes into your respiratory on your way to the mansion in comparison to my usual route at the city center. And finally, more inclined terrain, so more work especially to my already genetically developed gastrocnemius😁. And they do have zumba as well across the mansion just before the stairs leading to the horseback riding part of the park."
Wright Park,"Clean, well preserved family pine trees park in Baguio City🌲💗"
Wright Park,"The place is beautiful and is cherished by the Baguio people. For the tourists, please be mindful of others and please keep the environment clean (i.e. pick up your litter!). Finally, again for our dear visitors, please wear your masks properly and as much as possible at all times. Thank you!"
Wright Park,Clean park with lots of pasalubong stores. Good bargain. Do visit.
Wright Park,"Nice, cool place. Perfect to hangout with friends."
Wright Park,"beautiful park with long stretched pond surrounded by pine trees, it is in front of the mansion, best to visit this place including the mansion, botanical garden and mines view all the same time due to their close proximity"
Wright Park,Wright Park is one of the many scenic parts of Baguio. It is located at the city’s eastern part and in front of the main gate of The Mansion (the official summer residence of the president). Wright Park’s main features are the “Pool of Pines” and the horses around the area.
Wright Park,"Nothing much to do here, but if you fancy horses. This is a must place to visit."
Wright Park,My kids love the experience of horseback riding here at the Wright Park.👍
Wright Park,Nice place
Wright Park,"Classic Park in Baguio City. Good place to relax with the family, horse back riding, bike circuit and snacks."
Wright Park,"Nice place to walk around. From the mansion, you can easily walk here."
Wright Park,I didn't enjoy the place because I have hang over wahahaa but the place is nice
Wright Park,"Kids will enjoy the park because of the horses. Be careful on going up and down the stone stairs though, we just witnessed a kid who slipped and fell down the stairs. Good thing, he was already near the bottom of the stairs. Kid was okay."
Wright Park,Good place to explore and go around... Nature lover at it's finest. 🍃🐎🐕🌲 so many stairs to steps going up. 🤗
Wright Park,"Above the stairs, fragrant blossoms hang. Below the stairs, full of piss and dung."
Wright Park,I still don't like that they use horses to attract tourist. I pity the horses. So we just rented costumes and took photo here. Was able to but plants too
Wright Park,Well-maintained park!
Wright Park,A good place to stop by. We climbed a long flight of steps up to the Mansion House.
Wright Park,Nice place.
Wright Park,The official summer residence of the Philippine President. It's open for public viewing and located just infront of the Wright Park.
Wright Park,"Baguio is certainly the summer capital of the Philippines. It is a place to to go when you want to cool down from pressures of life. The cold weather makes it a perfect place to walk around and just feel the coldness of the air, making you chilling, but not overly. I keep coming back."
Wright Park,This place is really lovable. You get to ride horses take a picture and maybe even a non-permanent tattoo.If you're planning on going to baguio. Please understand that due to the pandemic their business has been so slow. We tourist need their help the most.It's not truly a baguio experience without going here.
Wright Park,"Nice area to jog, walk or run."
Wright Park,"Recently ""July 2019"" a large number of fish in the pool at Wright Park died due to oxygen depletion, fortunately most were saved and after the pool was cleaned out the fish will be reintroduced."
Wright Park,nice view.. tourist spot.
Wright Park,One of the must visit when in Baguio City. Here you'll find the sweetest oranges and grapes from Sagada. There's also Ube Taho being sold here along the sidewalk.
Wright Park,"Beautiful place, just a top the stairs is The Mansion..."
Wright Park,"Always nice to see popular tourist spots in Baguio such as Wright Park. A lot of picturesque views, nice Pine trees and wearing Igorot costumes makes for a good photo op."
Wright Park,"Right in front of the Mansion. Good place to stroll around, since it's a no parking zone."
Wright Park,"For the purpose of taking selfies, this is one of the best places in Baguio."
Wright Park,They removed some flowers to make the horses trail there. Lots of stalls. Hmmm.
Wright Park,Ganda😍😍😍😘
Wright Park,"A must visit place for a visitor in baguio city. I will tell you, the tall pine trees on the side walk is great for picture taking 😆"
Wright Park,Great Experience!
Wright Park,"Great place to jog, bike, walk pets, be at peace in nature."
Wright Park,I visited this place yearly nothing new but a good place to stay for bonding time. Just in front of Mansion
Wright Park,"Yes, its a great and beautiful place to relax. With centuries old pine trees, the grass smell  and the chill in the air. I love the place."
Wright Park,"You will experience how to ride a horse and ride like a cowboy in the olden times only here in Wright Park, Baguio City"
Wright Park,"The guides were helpful and the hosres look healthy. Some had their manes colored. The smell was pungent but tolerable, that's expected."
Wright Park,A place you can try horseback riding... May daan dyan papuntang the Mansion
Wright Park,Had fun riding the horse for the first time. The guide was friendly and funny.
Wright Park,I'm a fan of horses. But the place stinks. Really. And some of the horses look like unicorns without the horn lol. Still a good place to visit if you aim to go to Baguio though
Wright Park,This is a good place to take photo. Wag lang may photobomber 😅
Wright Park,After taking the obligatory picture taking in front of the gate of The Mansion we went to check on the Wright Park which is just across the street. I like the ambience in the park with the towering trees and colorful flowering plants surrounding the manmade body of water called pool of pines. It got rainy so we weren't able to fully explore the park beyond the pool and immediately went back to the car.
Wright Park,Great place for a walk during the hours of the day when there aren't too many tourists roaming around. And a good place to play pokemon go 😂😂.
Wright Park,"A very nice place specially for kids. You get to do horse back riding and buy some ""pasalubongs"" for your friends and family. Definitely a place to go when visiting Baguio!!"
Wright Park,Very good place to take pictures specially along the pine trees beside the road.
Wright Park,Nice place to take pictures.
Wright Park,"So random but the best ube and strawberry taho I've tried was from the vendors who sold them in front of the park, just beside The Mansion. I tried buying ube taho from Burnham Parm and it was incredibly disappointing—nothing compared to what I tried here! HEHE"
Wright Park,Nice place to go when you are here at baguio. Kids love those strawberry ice cream  flavor.
Wright Park,Fun fun fun..nice beautiful horses..friendly guides..not very nexpensive
Wright Park,Amazing views. Really tall trees. Good for family outings. Clean and peaceful. A lot of activities.
Wright Park,This is the most perfect place to visit in baguio City..
Wright Park,Historically amazing and well presevered structure and place...
Wright Park,"I don't know if what's the exact name of this place. But, this is inside Wright Park, above it connects to the famous ""The Mansion House""."
Wright Park,"Very peaceful now since quarantine is still in effect. Restoration of the old look will be of great help, especially for the twin stairs and pony riding area. City's tried to renovate but the only better preserved sections are the pond and old gazeebo.  Still a good place to catch lots of fresh air."
Wright Park,Beauty of the place depends on where you angle your view
Wright Park,You can't stop me on keep coming back on this beautiful place...
Wright Park,This park is not crowded. Enough to unwind and feel close to nature
Wright Park,It is very relaxing with your family and friends
Wright Park,Cool place. But animals are abused with colored dye.
Wright Park,Nice place to walk and explore. Next to The Mansion
Wright Park,Magnificent greens accented by a wide variety of flowers. Horses looked abused and overworked.
Wright Park,For walks… beautiful flowers
Wright Park,Beautiful place i love to see the kind of nature and trees
Wright Park,One of the best way to take pictures with Family right across the Mansion
Wright Park,Nice place. Good for walking walking
Wright Park,"Great experience of Horseback riding. Php400 per hour is worth it, especially for the kids riding on pink-haired ponies."
Wright Park,"Inhale the nature's fresh air. Peaceful. Enjoy the view with the lake. Just in front of ""The Mansion"""
Wright Park,"How will I forget this memorable place?It's here where I had my first horseback riding on my own amidst the muddy track of Wright Park during the first monsoon rains of May 2016. The park thrives with people and nature, and it should be kept this way.Wild flowers bloom naturally along its roads, and the pine tree grows freely, as if they are to touch the skies. The crisp fresh air allows us to regenerate ourselves from the strenuous aura of Metro Manila, and the activities we can do here are all worth to be paid for.I hope that the local vendors and businessmen here can endure the hardships we face during this pandemic, and the improvements for Wright Park's facilities take happen so that the entire park would have its new facelift despite the economic depression we are all experiencing today."
Wright Park,Great experience here
Wright Park,"Horse riding, assorted pasalubong items en plants for sale."
Wright Park,Still the best summer place to visit.
Wright Park,Also Beautiful place and Clean...💋💋💋
Wright Park,Good walking or jogging area for Manilenos.
Wright Park,it's a perfect place for jogging;)
Wright Park,Not as many people because of covid but its greatly improved
Wright Park,had a great time riding horse back. t'was my first time. the horse is actually really nice and chill. his name is emperor (103)
Wright Park,The weather is great to enjoy with your loved ones
Wright Park,"cool place,Where you can inhale a fresh air."
Wright Park,Pretty awesome in a cool weather. Nice to to walk around.
Wright Park,"There is definitely traffic on the way here. If you're fine with the smell of horses, then its a good tourist spot. Don't mind coming during wet season, or you'll have a bad time.Update as of March 28, 2022:There are two options.Either 30 mins or 1 hour horseback riding.If you pick the 30 mins one, they will say you will only ride within the horse track, which is very small. Around 100 meters for the whole track. The track is naturally covered in horse droppings meaning there will be a bit of a smell while within the track.If you pick the 1 hour one, you have the option to go around the local area. You'll be able to see a number of hotels and restaurants. The whole trip took us 36 minutes. If you opt for the tour, they will be asking for a ""guide fee"", wherein one of the horsetamers will help you navigate through the local area. We were able to negotiate to only pay for only the horses. It is not possible to leave the park without a guide.A 30 minute horse ride will cost 250, while the 1 hour one will cost 500. Quite a steep price if you're a couple totalling 1,000 PHP for an hour of riding.I would recommend going at around 4 PM to 5 PM because it can get really hot being under the sun, and there aren't as much tourists left.Do be mindful that these horses are practically overworked. They sometimes let a 2 year old horse start horseback riding, which in my opinion is very young.Would definitely give 5 stars if not for the very steep price."
Wright Park,A great park to walk and ride horse
Wright Park,Friendly horsemen. There are also souvenir shops around. :)
Wright Park,A small park where you can buy plants at cheap price. There is also a horse riding activity here which gave the park a bad smell.
Wright Park,It's a park in front of the mansion. Walk and take pictures.
Wright Park,Cool and beautiful      
Wright Park,This a good place to jog. It has a spacious lane around the garden pool (with green muddy water). It's good to run here since there are no slopes. I also has a small pine forest where you can stroll. You can also have a great view of the Mansion from here.
Wright Park,love it
Wright Park,"Nothing special here, but quite iconic place."
Wright Park,"The park itself is very nice. But if you want to do horseback riding be careful. The published rate is PHP 200 for 30 minutes but the guides will stop you at 18-20 minutes. When you pay, the guides will ask you for tip. Although I am always tipping for good service, I was really hesitant to give tip in this place because I felt forced to do so. One more thing is trust, because it was raining when we rode the horses, they lent us umbrellas. After paying and about to leave, one of the guides stopped our car and asked as for their umbrella. I made him check my trunk to show that it is not with us. Finally, they found their umbrella which was with them all the time. The park is really nice except the people running the horses. But otherwise, it was a worthwhile experience. Please visit and enjoy."
Wright Park,A beautiful place with a nice ambiance.
Wright Park,Want to Ride a Horse in Baguio and experience the cold weather while riding a horse.
Wright Park,"Month of June, fewer tourist and cooler climate. Such a refreshing experience"
Wright Park,Came for a horseback ride. Got cut short due to rain. But the horse handlers are friendly and would eventually let you go around on your own if they felt like you can handle it.
Wright Park,"Good for casual strolls, cold weather, nice view."
Wright Park,There are less attraction here. They only have horses for riding.
Wright Park,"Had a great time, enjoying the scenery and the place."
Wright Park,NOT RECOMMENDED TO GO DURING THE NIGHT. Go there anytime but not beyond 6am (when the sun is still up). There are horses and you can ride one. Downside is that the place smells so we quickly left and went to our next place. Two positive things: one is that it's a place to jog and sweat and two is that it's near botanical garden and The mansion which are two tourist spots. It's like hitting three birds with one stone.
Wright Park,4 stars to give way to improvements in the park.
Wright Park,"Serene, quiet must-see Baguio attraction. With newly constructed restrooms, ample parking, horseback riding, the Mansion, you can enjoy nature with your friends and family here. Picnic is an option as well."
Wright Park,A great place if you are looking to have a walk with your friends
Wright Park,Beautiful and super nice place ❤️
Wright Park,The place was improved as we go there every year. Horse back riding is more organized including rates per hour. They have waiting area with benches including those under the tree shades.
Wright Park,"How's water, swimmable 🤔"
Wright Park,"The horse area was fine they improved the walking area the souvenirs were good prices got my sons cowboy hat for 150 pesos, some posts complained about the smell, must have been city folks, maybe some of them can train the horses to use the CR :) the fish pond going up to the Mansion was dirty but overall well worth a stop and walk around the park. the previous post mentioned trash around the area while I did see some maintenance workers there was not a single garbage bin so some people put there trash in piles to at least have it somewhat clean so only 4 stars for lack of basic cleanliness required for public areas"
Wright Park,"Cool place although it can get smelly because of the horses.Make sure to try riding the horses too! You can explore Baguio horseback and it really rocks.There are gift stalls as well, you can try buying stuff to take home.The upper portion going towards the Mansion offers a date with the pine trees ans some picture opportunities."
Wright Park,Amazing view
Wright Park,The place is too crowded and not clean.. there are lots of trashes that are not properly disposed in a garbage bags.. sad.
Wright Park,My family enjoys an hour of horseback riding. Not just inside the park but we were allowed to ride the horse out on the streets which is a really cool experience
Wright Park,Nice place to eat lunch picnic style after visiting mines view park and the mansion.
Wright Park,"A nice park with interesting things to offer. The horses look really tired though and look ridiculous painted pink. The dogs also looks like they were drugged (This, I don't know for sure). The park is also near a school, so you may expect a lot, (I mean a LOT) of school children blocking the way. The park is still ok, nonetheless."
Wright Park,Additional lights needed for additional attraction. The rest are history. Body wellness such as jogging and other forms of recreation activities could be done there..... Horse back riding sounds great! souvenir items are available in hand.
Wright Park,Its summer adventure for the whole family..nice place to relax and enjoying kids...
Wright Park,Nice view despite of the comfort rooms being closed when we arrive early in the morning
Wright Park,Very nice apps.
Wright Park,Horses and steps makes it a wonderful spot to be at.
Wright Park,Wright place to relax 🤣
Wright Park,I love the huge pine trees in Wright Park. The park is just across The Mansion.
Wright Park,It is my first time in baguio and this is my first dedtination. The guides are very friendly. The wind is cold and fresh. I love it.
Wright Park,Need more personnel to remind tourists regarding cleanliness. Local tourism departnent must be crucial in implementation of their laws so that tourist will be obliges to follow the rules and regulations. Smells sucks but look at the bright side that you're with frienda and family and eveything will be fine. So crowded during peak season.
Wright Park,"Maybe because of the long wekend, it was really crowded. Our kids enjoyed horseback riding . We enjoyed the pleasant weather. I just missed the smell of the pine trees. The toilets were not maintained."
Wright Park,Good for walking and jogging. There are also colorful horses which you can take a ride and pay for a reasonable price for a specific time frame of the ride. Variety of flowers were displayed at the side of the road as well. And lastly the big Selfie Doggy is really catching the tourists attention.
Wright Park,It's nice place to visit
Wright Park,Picturesque place. Nice trees and gardens.
Wright Park,"It's clean, fresh air..more flowering plants maybe for more beauty, pleasing to the eyes, better views, sceneries"
Wright Park,Best place for nature shower!
Wright Park,Enjoyable nice place for family bonding
Wright Park,Place to go around and take pictures
Wright Park,Totally love this place. First time to ride a horse and totally nailed it. The price is right P250 for 30 mins but they can accomodate you for P500 for 1 hour but you can ride it outside or on the highway which is really cool.
Wright Park,"If you're looking for a place to have a family bonding, this the place. This park is good for taking pictures, you can ride horses and its also a road apart from the mansion. No entrance fees required! Nice place"
Wright Park,"Baguio City - Wright Park is a landmark and tourist attraction all year round, a place to enjoy and have fun for children."
Wright Park,Wonderful also the weather
Wright Park,It offers a good tourist activity such as horseback riding. Park visits and now there are numerous options for dining too... Parking space is good enough including parking in establishments is available..
Wright Park,Good place to experience and even practice horse riding. The smell is something you should get used to but that goes without question in a place like this. Rates are fine and the trainers are amicable as well.
Wright Park,"Horseback riding, eating and shopping - that's the summary of what you can do in this park. The Mansion is also at the top of the stairs (like long - prepare to climbthe stairs or ride your car going up). There's stalls for souvenir items as well. There's clean comfort room too but you have to pay."
Wright Park,"The management doesn't make proper managing, horse poop around , muddy trail need pave foothpath and bad smell all over the place. Many bystanders also on the way there barking for paid parking or even offering umbrella or taking pictures with their old dog st. Bernard. Nota tourist spot anymore"
Wright Park,Cool place where horseback riding was offered and  some stalls where selling souvenirs and light snacks.one stall has a henna tattoo services... Long stair steps leading to Baguio mansion.. parking available at the step of the stair below..
Wright Park,Color yellow pati lake! I love yellow! 😂 😂 😂 😂
Wright Park,Weekends are busy but of course not as crowded as pre covid days but still busy. We went on a monday and were the only customer  at that time. 250 pesos for a 30min ride around
Wright Park,Great view of the mansion.
Wright Park,Nice to wal around in the morning
Wright Park,Old but still a nice place to visit and take pix while in Baguio.
Wright Park,My nieces and Nephews had fun riding the horse in this area.
Wright Park,"It's a kid friendly park. My children enjoyed the horse back riding and the delicious strawberry, avocado with cheese ice cream flavor. There's also souvenir shop where you can buy nice woodcrafts, key chain and printed T-shirts. They have photo booth promoting Ifugaños national costume. You can also buy beautiful plants like wild orchids, roses and other ornamental plants."
Wright Park,Horses' manure isn't very nice to smell. Some people wouldn't dare to get close to the park because of the smell. The cost of riding a horse for several minutes is 200 pesos while 20 pesos if you wanted to take some pictures. You can also reach the Mansion if you climb for several minutes.
Wright Park,great for tourists...you can take pictures with  indigenous costumes/dress and try horseback riding; you will get a good work out climbing the stairs to cross the Mansion
Wright Park,"Nice park, I really enjoyed there 😊👍"
Wright Park,Nice view
Wright Park,"Another beautiful park in baguio. The place smells, apart from that it's clean and great. Tried taking a pic with Holiday, the brown horse. Php 50 when you take a pic riding the horse and Php 10 when you take a pic standing beside him. Would love to try riding one tho, but when we inquired the man said it's Php 500, not sure if it's true or not."
Wright Park,Goods environment and fresh air
Wright Park,The place was nice but crowded
Wright Park,It was a bumpy ride on horseback to Mines View. Takes some getting use to.
Wright Park,Good for families and children. Horse back riding popular for a fee. Plenty of snacks and drinks for sale at local stalls. Walking distance to Mansion House.
Wright Park,If horse back riding is your thing this is the spot. They also have small shops lining the streets. And little mom and pop food shops.Horse back riding is around 250. Pesos for 30 mins. And there is a track where you ride around.If you choose the 500 Pesos plan. That buys you 1 hour and you can ride a different route instead of staying in the track.
Wright Park,Awesome
Wright Park,A nice place with many things to do
Wright Park,Still under construction/ renovations
Wright Park,too much commercialism in the area from the pony rides to dogs being usex for picture taking which stresses them. its filthy with the manure and urine of horses around the park. there's a lot going on- from vendors to stalls . no place to sit for park goes. congested parking. the view atop the stairs is a reprieve but could be a struggle
Wright Park,Wright Park Horse Tree Area is a forested area located at Baguio City adjacent to Pacdal Circle rotunda beside Jose Rizal Elementary School which is used primarily as a sun shade and horse riding promenade for visiting tourists and locals. The area is encircled by an unpaved soil horse track which becomes muddy when it rains and dusty during summertime. Horse riders can also  explore and go inside its forested area with their horse guides. This promenade is well lit at night by a good number of streetlights. A sought after and highly recommended city tourist attraction/destination to learn guided and basic horse riding.
Wright Park,Well maintained and regulated park.
Wright Park,"Nice place if you want horse back riding, also expect the stinky smell. hahaha"
Wright Park,This is a fun place to ride horses around the cement oval track if you're a kid. The place has improved over the years as the track area used to be a dirt field. My kids and nephews had a fun time. Your get to ride the horses for 30 min and they also offer a guided tour that takes you around the area for an additional fee. There are picture taking spots with one spot where you can take a photo with a large St. Bernard. It seems that this gimmick is also found at another location so it's not the only large dog around. The horse my son had was tired and lazy and we found out it was it's first time to be riden on by tourists. The horses look tired and the watchers often had to slap their behinds to encourage them to gallop.  There are street vendors selling strawberry taho and also local grapes and lychee.
Wright Park,"Loved this place since I was 5. Though the man made pond on the middle was changed from a Koi-filled pond to a stagnant water pond. Horseback riding is one of the popular destination here. A tip for you Plant lovers, don't buy a ready-made bonsai arrangement from the flower shops here. They just cut it and re-pot cactus and other bonsais. A good way to present and earn money. Feel i I was scammed. Now my cacti are rotting."
Wright Park,Local govt should cease private vehicles parked on both sides of the park. There were law enforcement in the area but doesn't do anything. These vehicles ruined the beauty of the park.
Wright Park,"It's a good place for stroll or even for horse riding . It's just some of the people who went here left their trash behind, very disappointed for those . Even  though  they have garbage collectors or sweepers, please keep in mind to be responsible with our surroundings,  especially with you own garbage"
Wright Park,This park is famous for horseback riding. You could also buy souvenirs here and it is very close to the mansion - official residence for the president of the Philippines.You could go around as a form of exercise. The park is known amongst locals as where. Students come here to practice as well.There are food stalls in case you go hungry and it seems like there is taho available throughout the day.
Wright Park,Great Place  to unwind  .
Wright Park,This is a smaller size Park but it's really quite beautiful walking through it and when you get to the wooden structure in the middle you will be impressed. At least I was. As with any public place there are quite a few vendors selling keychains shirts snacks ect. If your girlfriend is a selfie queen she will have quite a few pictures to take here :)
Wright Park,"Its where the famost horse back experience, meet the cowboy ponyboys, and horses. Next to the Mansion House and Minesview area."
Wright Park,Not much to see about except for the horses and 200 steps stairs to the mansion
Wright Park,"The place is clean though kind of smelly due to the horses as they also offer horse-back riding. A haven for selfie enthusiast as they also offer very clean Igorot costumes at Php20 per costume & you can have as many selfies as you want! From this park you can also visit The Mansion where our past & present presidents reside when in Baguio. Souvenir & some street food stalls are also available. The place is still good and though not that great, it's still one of the must-see in Baguio."
Wright Park,I love the weather and the view
Wright Park,"Peace and quiet place, its good to stay here if you'll planning to have nice conversation and feeling the big trees around you, the mansion is off limits to normal people even though it's meant to be seen by the public, sounds sketchy to me but anyways everyone should not miss visiting this place when coming to Baguio."
Wright Park,"Best place to hangout with the family. There is horse-back riding, photobooth for native costumes, a throve if souvenir shops and a lot more to do here. Be prepared for a lot of walking uphill."
Wright Park,This place is good with a lot of hourses for you to ride on or take a picture for a fee.We hope the ground is friendly enough for hourses feet so that their welfare maybe taken care of.
Wright Park,Beautiful Place to go . I Highly Recommend this place
Wright Park,Appreciate how the handlers' are sensitive to kids desire for hte horse to gallop rather than just walking.  My daughter enjoyed and it would seem the horse enjoyed galloping if not running..hahaha.
Wright Park,This is a nice place to visit.
Wright Park,Good for a walk and we've seen people jogging here. A lot of tours vans we're there. A lot of food stalls if you're tired.
Wright Park,"Good nature, and the people  is very friendly."
Wright Park,Horses + St. Bernards. Terrible parking though. Price of having photo taken with the horse or dog at Php20 (USD.40) cheaper inside the park rather than the one in the parking area. Horse back riding at Php250/30 mins. Php500/hour plus guide.
Wright Park,"Instagram worthy as what they call it. If you're looking for a Horseback riding action, this is the best place to go. Rates were 500php per hour and 250php for 30mins, updated as of Feb 1."
Wright Park,A place for the President to stay if he/she is in Baguio.
Wright Park,Succulents are healthy and come and visit our farm
Wright Park,"Good place to walk around, even jog."
Wright Park,"Though not much activity for horses this days, it still brings back memories when a lot of visitors come and have a horse back riding."
Wright Park,You can ride horse with kids already.
Wright Park,Very accessible and just a stone throw away from The Mansion and the restaurants. The unlimited shot and the rental of Igorot Costume for only 20 PHP per head is a steal compared to the one in Mines View Park.
Wright Park,Best visited at dawn
Wright Park,This place is good for jogging and walking. If u haven’t try the horseback riding then it’s a good place to experience it. There is an Igorot costumes which you can wear and take a selfie. Also you can have a selfie with the big St. Bernard Dogs which is also a trend in this park. A cool and eco-friendly place with a nice ambiance to have a date with your love ones which I did with my girlfriend (Iza). Took pictures of flowers. Good for relaxing if you had a tiring day. We stay a bit longer here to kill our time while waiting the place we’re about to stay.
Wright Park,I like wright park because it's wide and not crowded. If you like to dress up like an Igorot. You can wear the Igorot custom cheaper than the mines view park😂 It cost 20pesos only while in mines view its 25 to 30pesos. From the proper city you can ride a jeep it cost 10 pesos only. The terminal is near Danes Bakeshop.
Wright Park,Best place
Wright Park,I cannot recall the number of times i've visited Baguio City. I've been here since i was a child but only visited Wright Park once. Last April 24 we went here but didn't go as far as going to the entire park. We just looked around the front of Mansion House. I particularly liked the big blooming Jacaranda Tree just in front of the Mansion House and saw other similar trees around Wright Park as well..
Wright Park,"I don't hate horses. I hate horseback riding. Something bad always happens when I do it. I saw a kid get bitten on the wrist when 2 horses fought. 2 of my friends fell off a horse in 1 day. I vaguely remember myself falling off (repressed memory?). One time, my horse was running one way, then suddenly made a 180 and ran the other way. So I reluctantly agreed to try again, maybe this is the day I conquer my fear. Nah. My ankle was kinda burned by the straps. And I hurt in a specific area. Plus my wife's horse hated my horse. I won't rate this low though. My kids had fun. Hopefully they grow up without this irrational fear."
Wright Park,Goodplace to jog when it's morning
Wright Park,"This Park is where you can find Horses. If you wish to have a ride, the pony Boys can take you around J. Filipe Street, heading to Mansion House and Right Park Lake, then back to Wright Park where you started. You will be charged P500.00/ hour."
Wright Park,Great park!
Wright Park,"If you want your family to experience horse riding, this is the place to be in Baguio. The downside is that foul odor is to be expected.Also, better bargain for those garden enthusiasts as prices for plant seedlings are lower that those from Mines View"
Wright Park,"If you want to learn how to ride a horse in short notice, this is the right place for you. You get to take picture horse, and learn to ride too and enjoy the weather whilst in Baguio as though it is sunny, the breeze just felt right while you are learning"
Wright Park,lovely place! clean and well maintained...
Wright Park,Still amazing even after my 4th time. Also art exhibit was the best.
Wright Park,The locals were good and polite.. they were accommodating to inquiries but the horse back riding lacks medical first aid station.. not all guides were attentive to safety of the riders..
Wright Park,"A place to try horseback riding, many horses to choose from, there's even a pink one. There are vendors of pasalubong, food and drinks and plants as well. There's also stairs where you can climb like 100+ steps I think but we weren't able to try."
Wright Park,Cool place with colorful  horses.
Wright Park,"500 pesos per hour. you can choose to ride around with a guide. If you do, tip the guide please."
Wright Park,Really good place for a jog

Wright Park,Wright park is just right for a slow walk with a view.
Wright Park,considerable nice place for outing but still needs government attention for sanitary development. many tourist play here but there are still luck of development.
Wright Park,"This place is a great place. However, I would suggest adding more attractions on the place. The place may be peaceful and quiet, but it is quite dull sometime. A little gimmick wouldn't hurt, right?"
Wright Park,"Clean, not crowded, but plenty of cyclists."
Wright Park,"Too touristy! Your horse doesn't get anywhere and your photos full of bombers, your videos full of noise! Best to go horseback riding at Camp John Hay."
Wright Park,It's a nice place to visit when you are in baguio
Wright Park,"Across the park is The Mansion,  two of the most visit spot in Baguio City."
Wright Park,Needs rehabilitation and plenty of room for organized activities to have more fun. Painting on the spot and discover new artist can be one of many activities to consider.
Wright Park,I like it simply because of the weather. Bad side is that there were few flowers when i get there unlike before when I travelled here when I was young. (Prolly not its season )
Wright Park,Great experience in botanical garden baguio city
Wright Park,"Friendly people, great nice olace for horseback riding"
Wright Park,Good experience for the children..
Wright Park,"The park is part of the mansion house complex. Unfortunately, personnal interest prevailed and the park deteriorated. It become a private property. It is good the phil.supreme court invalidated the ncip title issued."
Wright Park,"Wright Park is one of the go to places for family bondong especially for families with little kids. Good place to ride horses, buy strawberry taho, take pictures wearing Igorot costume or with St. Bernard dogs :) We were also able to get a good deal for herb planters, flowering plants and cactus. My baby especily enjoyed the puppet we bought from there at cheap price if Php 50. It was a wonderful experience except for the smell of the place."
Wright Park,"Go to place for horse riding, nice people"

Wright Park,Our Family's jogging area up to mansion house...peaceful and part of an amazing Baguio!
Wright Park,Enjoy horseback riding. You haven't been to Baguio if you never had your photos taken in this place. Get henna tattoos for very cheap prices.
Wright Park,"Has a great view and has shops where you can buy lots of souvenirs, but dont go there during holidays or weekends the amount of tourists can be super annoying."
Wright Park,its good for wanting a place to rent horses. a little stinky because of horse dung but the atmosphere is good and downright country.
Wright Park,Good place for kids to enjoy on horse back...restaurants accross the road are also great...but might not be a place for people who cant bear animal smell or marshy land at the horse ride area..
Wright Park,Experience the igorot tribe by wearing this traditional dress as you go around the park.
Wright Park,"Great family place, quite smelly though"
Wright Park,Nice place to take a photo and hang out. Feeling tired? Walk under the shade of the trees and you'll feel better and recharged in no time.
Wright Park,Good place for a children's amusement park
Wright Park,"You would ride horses and Roam around the Park, and experience the thrill of riding a horse."
Wright Park,Instgram perfect views
Wright Park,Nice place for a stroll. Best public toilet I've seen in baguio.
Wright Park,If you want to ride a horse wright park is best for you. 500 pesos for 30mins and 50 pesos for picture taking only.
Wright Park,If riding on the street and pink names is yours ok otherwise better go to the strawberry farm in Trinidad and ride there as the trail is a lot better and closer.
Wright Park,My kids had fun with horse riding.. and a few steps away you can see the famous The Mansion.
Wright Park,"Nice park, lots of souvenir store. Nice people around, very accommodating. Don't miss the picture taking with the horse and st.bernard."

Wright Park,"The place is relaxing and comfortable. You can ride horses, bring your bike or play skateboard."
Wright Park,smells horrible. pee and dung of horses are just overwelming. i have worked on a resort with horses and it does not smell thay bad.
Wright Park,"If you want to try horseback-riding this is the place to go. You just have to bear with the horrendous odor from horse poop and pee. Lots of people and I think the horses are overworked, just saying. I just go here to buy succulents,  other plants then leave."
Wright Park,It improves a lot compared 20 years ago during my first stay in baguio..
Wright Park,Most confuse the park with the stinky horse-riding rental area. The actual park is above this (take the road up a bit) and across the Presidential residence at the Summer Capital
Wright Park,Nearest landmark to the Mansion House
Wright Park,Place is very relaxing but the horses are very smelly and not healthy to people that are having pulmonary problems. They should have at least clean the stables more often
Wright Park,Peaceful and serene when I went here. Good place to reflect and enjoy nature.
Wright Park,"A bit crowded last Christmas when we visited the place, there are still horses and the smell of horses, LGU could do some tidying up, also needs a clean cr"
Wright Park,"My favorite horse back riding place, variety of horses to choose from, for different ages and sizes. Well organized and fair enough price."

Wright Park,The horses are available... you ca  aslo walk up and around the park.❤️
Wright Park,It's a nice place to relax and do leisure walking. But i'm just concerned with the fish in the pool of pines i can't see them
Wright Park,"We went through the stairways, dress up like the natives, ride the horse, buy fruits, eat, buy the tea plants and wow found a ""sungkaan""  a little expensive but tolerable. The experience was worth it."
Wright Park,Superb fantastic  place 👌 👏
Wright Park,"great like horseback riding, there's also an access going up the stairs towards the Mansion (official presidential residence)"

Wright Park,Great place for horseback riding

Wright Park,verry nice place in baguio city
Wright Park,A nice park of horses and flowers
Wright Park,"one of the many scenic parks in Baguio City, Wright Park is absolutely the right place you need to visit after seeing The Mansion which is just fronting the place."
Wright Park,It is a very wide place for horseback riding. Just ignore the smell. It's a very beautiful place to unwind.
Wright Park,"Nice weather, cold in the morning and afternoon, nice to jog around the reflection lake when you reached the top, fronting the Mansion House (Presidential Residence of the Philippines)"
Wright Park,It's not the scent of pine trees that permeate.  Its close to the mansion and st joseph church. I wonder if the story of the baguio maiden's ghost is true?
Wright Park,Such a nice place
Wright Park,People are nice and all but aside from riding horses (which fun for first timers).. Theres nothing much to do and see here.
Wright Park,"The #GoogleMap instructions led us to the closed section. #EpicFail. The detour sent us to the dead end. When you breach the rotonda, look for the Horse Stable instead."
Wright Park,Nice to jog early in the morning and late afternoon. When ever I'm in Baguio I always go there for relaxation as well.
Wright Park,"Very relaxing place, good for taking photos. Nice to walk around here and feel the nature."
Wright Park,Lots of pine trees around and the weather is nice...
Wright Park,I usually pass by in this area going down to the horses. What I love there is the wide selection of tropical ornaments for sale!
Wright Park,Needs more inprovement especially cr. But horse backriding trail is very nice and flowers are well kept.

Wright Park,Hoping everything will be back to normal. There's few horses there now.
Wright Park,Amazing place to have your quiet time
Wright Park,Because of fine trees
Wright Park,climbing up the stairs is a good exercise. not much to do except walk around and ride horses
Wright Park,its not good n
Wright Park,"Its a clean place, notwithstanding the smell of the horses. Go up the steps and you get transported to a different level of nature imbibing."
Wright Park,Beautiful park. And the folks selling some fruits offered some free taste.. They are very polite and helpful.. A must see in Baguio
Wright Park,There is a resto nearby where you can watch the horses while you are having a cup of coffee
Wright Park,"Horseback riding is amazing, nearby parks is very accesible like botanical garden, mines view park and the mansion."
Wright Park,Being in front of the The Mansion- Presidents Official Residence in baguio- make the place a visit worthy. Another must try in wright park is the strawberry flavored  taho.
Wright Park,Beautiful and serene
Wright Park,Nice place to hang out and spend leisure with the family. Enjoyed the view and the ambience of the place!
Wright Park,Great place for family bonding and taking pictures
Wright Park,"For a quick breather and a good little chat with your travel buddies, then after that you can choose to go horse riding."
Wright Park,"Beautiful park, but the pandemic made close some access... So sad"
Wright Park,It's nice but the flowers are not that beautiful. There's a lot of affordable shops to buy souvenirs.
Wright Park,"Horses are taken care not like in other places that their horses are thin and weak. Baguio horses are big, healthy and looking good"
Wright Park,Love it
Wright Park,"still a good place to go, a little peaceful during off season. crowded during peak"
Wright Park,"If you want to relax and breathe baguio vibes, just visit here not so much crowded, they have some table and seats to eat if you feel tired and hungry."
Wright Park,Nice ambiance where you can visit and enjoy too. It is also good when have dates
Wright Park,Its convenient. Just across the street one will find the mansion.. a very historical place to see and wander about..
Wright Park,"The place is great but please have a uniform price upon taking pictures with dogs and horses, some are overpricing the tourists but serves same with the cheap ones."
Wright Park,This should be complete five points if horses inside weren't locked waiting for tourists to ride them while they starved.
Wright Park,Needs clean up and revitalization of the park
Wright Park,"Do you love horse? This is were you can find and ride them. Don't mind the smell, it is natural."
Wright Park,I enjoyed riding a horse with my 4yr old son..who's also very happy with the experience.
Wright Park,"...although i do not really encourage abuse of animals by placing a heavy load on its back, this is one place in baguio city where children can experience riding a real horse"
Wright Park,"Nice view and a very affordable items like  pasalubong and souviners to buy. And now I  can say that this place git a big big improvement,great job!"

Wright Park,A good area for kids horseback riding. Choose your own adventure or horse.
Wright Park,Awesome sauce!  Great views for a relaxing and peaceful walk!  Memorable place for me...
Wright Park,elegant and cool place
Wright Park,Beautiful scenery. Horse riding. Igorot photos. And more. Family friendly. Souvenir
Wright Park,"If you are not a fan of horses or their smells, I suggest you skip this place. There is nothing you could do here unless you are riding them."
Wright Park,It was pleasing to the eyes👀👀👀
Wright Park,Great park for a walk but go in the early morning as it gets crowded with tourists pretty fast.
Wright Park,Stairs are a safety hazard and I don't think the horses appear very happy with their current predicament entertaining ignorant visitors on the subtleties of borderline animal abuse.
Wright Park,Great place for families
Wright Park,"Memorable place to me because I got kicked   by a horse long, long time ago. Lol. I can see that it's a lot safer now."
Wright Park,Stinks and much smaller now since they developed much of the area for commercial purposes. Not recommended for touring anymore.
Wright Park,A place you can stroll your dogs.
Wright Park,I find the horse range/tracks to be small especially when a lot of people are present. I think that the horses need a bath and anti lice shampoo.
Wright Park,Cool place and really nice place to bond with your family or loved ones because of the large area

Baguio Botanical Garden,"One of the best gardens I visited. This place  is Eden-like cozy version. If you are dreaming of going to Denmark or Amsterdam or any European countries but on a very tight budget, this is a good alternative.The place is clean, the flowers are beautiful. The ambiance of the place is relaxing. There are food stalls too where you can just sit, eat, relax, stroll and repeat.This is also a good place to propose!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Marvel at the best landscape architectural project I have ever seen. Don't be fooled by it's name this isn't your typical plant based attraction.This place will be very hard to explain in words so it is best if you see it in personal. It has different cultural gardens. It has a great play with elevation. It has tunnels it has great paid comfort room that brings you deep inside the rain forest. But most importantly, it has a coffee shop situated perfectly to feast your eyes with a view."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"For entrance fee of just 10 pesos, you can spend time with your friends and family in this beautiful and newly renovated garden. Go on a weekday if you can to avoid the crowd. There is a milk tea stall in the middle of the park if you want refreshments, and a cafe near the entrance. Take time to see the cacti collection. Restrooms are clean. Highly recommended to both locals and tourists."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"This is a beautiful place to visit if your staying a few days in Baguio. I saw so many different varieties of flowers and plants, that I hadn’t ever seen before. There were a lot of people here so be patient you will get your turn to view. Also there is a very low admission fee. Your camera’s are going to enjoy this location."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Newly improved botanical garden. With improved ambiance. When you want to shoot or pictorial you need a permit @ the entrance. Don not worry for your safety there are guards roaming around. Also restrooms are within the vicinity, you need to pay for maintenance aside from the entrance fee. Enjoy the view!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I visited Baguio Botanical Garden twice already. My first time was in June 24, 2022, then second time was on my birthday August 4, 2022. They have an entrance fee of 10.00 pesos only. It's worth it, beyond worth it. I enjoy visiting this place. It's like everytime you visit, you still discover something new in the place. You got to experience different ambiance as they have Japanese Garden, Korean Garden and lot more. You can see lots of plants, flowers and succulents which I love. You can discover new species of plants that you do not usually or rarely see in your own place. If you go to Baguio, I recommend this place for you to visit. If I go to Baguio for the third time, I will definitely visit the Baguio Botanical Garden again."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It's good to be back here after a decade and I liked that they have developed this place. You only need to pay P10 entrance fee which is very cheap. The rest room is very clean and spacious. There are lots of beautiful spots for picture taking but expect to share the place with lots of tourists. All in all, it's a very relaxing place worth visiting when you're in Baguio."
Baguio Botanical Garden,great place with a beautiful scenery!! if you like to walk and just admire the surroudings then this is for you! The best thing would be that the entrance fee is only 10 pesos yer you get to see a great view! Tables are also available around so I guess you can bring food for snacks there but there is also a cart inside that sells coffee.
Baguio Botanical Garden,One of the newest open attraction in Baguio after two years of closed because of pandemic.They made a lot of changes in their landscaping. It looks more beautiful now than before.Just visit and see the new scenery.
Baguio Botanical Garden,There was a 10 pesos entrance fee per person. Super nice place to walk around specially if you are into plants. The park has different sections that have their own themes. Be prepared to walk and climb stairs though
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I was amazed how big this place is, almost took us a day to check every spot here. I can't take pictures of the tunnel/cave as it was too dark (and it was awesomely cold!), but I enjoyed it there. It's a good place for picnic too, they've prepared large tables for families, but it doesn't have umbrellas installed so do consider the weather.We ordered food from Grab, we were not aware it was a big place and would cost the whole morning to afternoon. The park is ok with deliveries, just meet the riders by the entrance and remember to clean up after.It's a nice place for family picnic/outing, pets are allowed but remember to clean up if they're not wearing any diapers."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"This is the first time in a long time that I've been in Baguio's Botanical Gardens. A lot has changed since my last visit. The plants are now more organized than before. The garden is divided in smaller portions to classify the plants and trees. All in all it's a good stroll. I recommend going in the morning, it's good to walk and bask in the sun while surrounded by plants and flowers. You can also check out the restaurant near the entrance of the gardens, their coffee and baby back ribs is great."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Entrance fee is very minimal but you get to see the wonders and beauty of flora and enjoy a tour around for as long as you want.  A very relaxing and accessible place, it is worth the visit.  It is my 5th time to visit the place but would still go here next time because there is always something new added to its attraction."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It was a fun experience.  The place is wide, clean and a lot of areas to take pictures to. You have to pay for the rest room though, with different rate depending on what you need to do, 1 or 2.Area is really fascinating with wide variety of flowers."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Baguio Botanical Garden is one of the most visited place in the Summer Capital of the Philippines.It features colorful flowers, plants, nipa huts and a glimpse of Japanese, Chinese , Canada and Thailand sites. You can also enjoy the tunnel cave and feel the ambience of a true cave. The entrance fee is affordable which is very low ₱10 for every adult.Visit the place, feel the breeze and enjoy the view."
Baguio Botanical Garden,A Must Visit Place. Entrance Fee at Just P10. Amazing Place to spend your whole day at. Beautiful Flowers everywhere! You can also buy Plants here. At the entrance is a food shop where you can buy Snacks and Meals.
Baguio Botanical Garden,I really love the place. The commune to nature brings in a relaxing ambience. Lots of spots to take pictures and I truly enjoyed the scenery and my entire duration of roaming around the garden.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"The place looks nice, and tranquil moreover the entrance fee for Baguio botanical garden is only 10 pesos. My suggestion to the management of BBG, they should put the names (English and Tagalog), descriptions and scientific names of the plants and trees so that, the visitors will know what kind of flowers or trees they are looking at.If you are going to visit Baguio don't miss the opportunity to visit Baguio botanical garden."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"One of the must visit parks in Baguio. Very nice landscaping, I think they poured in a lot to rehab the place. Perfect for all ages, however, as the day goes on it gets crowded, so I suggest you visit in the early hours with just enough sunrays to color the garden. Entrance fee is only 10 pesos. Try also visiting it at night especially now that its December, I think they have put up lights."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Renovations are impressive! It's a completely different garden now. What I impressed the most is the layout. It's clever to have the souvenir shops and a cafeteria by the exit that is also near to the entrance
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Really great improvement from the last I got here. I really loved the lightings. Sadly, the management were not able to check the volume of people that will be visiting here. Long lines of people will wait for you when you come here in the evening so bring along with you a lot of patience. Parking is limited."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Very beautiful this time! I loved the variety they have of God's creation, most especially the orchids and cacti. Very big pluses are the well-maintained restroom and the convenient cubicles that sell drinks and snacks."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Entrance was cheap (10 pesos). It is well developed compared to it's previous iteration. Nature lovers will be delighted for the experience that they will have when they visit the place.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Too bad we didn’t bring an umbrella and extra jacket because it rained unexpectedly. Super foggy as you can see in the pictures. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the beautiful cacti, succulents and flowers including the bonsai."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Great place to spend an hour with the family. Fresh air and very clean bathrooms. Cultural dress up and photos taking opportunities. Chinese garden, Igorot stone carvings."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Last went here in 2014 and just got back in 2022. Now, it is even more improved and prettier. It is worth the P10.00 entrance fee. It is low because it is owned by the government of Baguio City. Although it used to be free, 10.00 is not painful at all because it needs little help in budget to improve the place. It is a breath of fresh air in the middle of the city, and it is not crowded unlike other parks in Baguio. We were able to sit down and appreciate the plants and flowers. It is beautiful.EDIT: I heard that the new entrance fee as of June 2022 is 50.00, but that also depends if you are a resident (might be cheaper than a tourist rate) a tourist, a student, or if you have a senior citizen ID."
Baguio Botanical Garden,You can get there by taking a jeepney from the town proper. Prepare a 10 pesos for entrance fee. Very cheap compared to the view that you will be seeing. Very relaxing place and there's a variety of flowers. You can also buy flowers/cactus here.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"One of a great place to see when visiting Baguio City! There are a lot of improvements here in Botanical Garden. They also have a parking spaces and souvenir shops. However, they collect an entrance fee of 10 pesos per person but it is totally worth it, It has a lot of improvements."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"the place is very nice, the flowers are well taken of, and the place was very clean also. The only problem i have in this place is that it lacks a 'silungan' when raining, that's why expect to be drenched in rain if you’ll go here during the rainy season. Nonetheless, it is definitely a tourist must-visit place!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Entrance is affordable and there's a lot to be seen here. For those plantitos/plantitas, you can also buy plants here. This is a heaven for those who are into gardening as you will see different kinds and wide variety of plants and flowers. They have pay CR inside that is well maintained. Visit this place if you love plants and take pictures."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"This place made me say, “If only we have this kind of park in every cities.” It’s good for families, barkadas and lovers alike. Good for cardio too. I enjoyed walking around here."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I may say that this baguio attraction is more beautiful than ever...You can spend your half day in this placePlace is very inviting to unwind and relaxI think, when pandemic hitted us 2yrs ago, management didnt stop to cultivate, nourish the nature and planted more flowers and build in this attraction, and until now they are continuing to do their effortWith a minimal entrance fee, you can spend a quality time with your family, you can bring foods and have a picnic in a designated area, restaurant also insideRestroom or confort room and souvenir shops available, i must say their souvenirs here are one of those that offers cheapest pricePhoto opt everywhere, please follow protocols and rulesGood job Baguio government!"

Baguio Botanical Garden,This Baguio botanical garden is larger than the other gardens I've been to. The concept of having a distinct area for succulent plants was great.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Entrance fee: 5 pesos for kids, 10 pesos for adultMay coffee area. May souvenir shop sa taas.Some area are still being improved but over all the Botanical Garden has improved a lot.Mas maganda kung may picnic area in the future."
Baguio Botanical Garden,If you love the flowers and plants this place is for your. If you are in bagiuo and have 2-3 hours then this place should be in your list. Entrance fee is 10 per person

Baguio Botanical Garden,"We brought our 5 month old and a stroller. We appreciated the paths ways for strollers. It does not extend to the entire lot though, but we were pleasantly surprised nonetheless. For what they are charging, it was worth a visit.  Dont compare it to any of the botanical gardens like Singapore for example. From what i heard, compared to few years ago, it has improved significantly and more work are in progress."

Baguio Botanical Garden,"Lovely place to visit, deffinately worth while. Also many souvenir shops with low prices. T shirts for 150 pesos. Lots of walking, so be prepared."
Baguio Botanical Garden,It is a new improve Botanical Garden with a minimal amount of entrance fee for only 10 pesos you can enjoy the flowers bloom of Baguio and other interesting view.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Iam from vienna in Austria middle europe positioned and we have an long and rich culture about install an botanical garden that looks nice but must confess this botanical garden from baguio are looks more brighter and have some more fun areas as the ones I know in austria.This are an stunning so-called instagram tik tok able area for influencer even photographers and families so when you visit the Philippines don't miss this place!💯💯🏞
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It's one of the tourist destination that a must in your baguio trip. The place is so color by the abundance of plants and flowers. Any spots in the area is so picturesque that needed of your IG account... with the help of the weather in baguio, Its feels like in different country... It is also nearby in other tourist destination. From city proper or in market you can ride with taxi for a minimal amount going to botanical. And from this, it's just walking distance to The Mansion and Wright Park."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Felt so relaxed,great place to walk around. Beautiful flowers all around, my kids love the big elephant statue and the cave."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Botanical is very different now compared to when I was little. Being a Baguio local, we seldom visit these 'tourist attractions' and will only do so if we play hostess to family and friends from abroad or the low lands to explore the city.Overall, I hope the improvements are sustained."
Baguio Botanical Garden,It was a great experience. But when were here its raining. We ddnt enjoy the view . Worth to visit. Alot of souveiners as well and its cheap.  Better to visit here in Summer time so u will enjoy the view. Hope it helps😉
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Upon arriving at the Botanical Garden Baguio, you will be welcomed by an impressive sculpture made of stone painted in bronze that depicts the different rituals of the Cordillera tribes, and real Igorots swathed in their traditional clothes willing to take a photo with you for a minimal fee. Once you’re inside, you will see different lawns, an art gallery, and souvenir booths selling native handicrafts lined up in a row. Then you’ll also see the different relics from Botanical Garden’s Igorot Village days with large statues exemplifying diverse Cordillera tribesmen and symbols and the native Cordillera huts."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"We arrived here around 10am and stayed for about 45 minutes. Most plants were well-tended and vibrant. The sunflowers were wilting. There were a lot of people, so it was difficult to take photos without people in the background, so a tip would be to arrive right after 6am opening time."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"10 Pesos well worth it. This place is a nice place to take pictures, specially if there's not a lot of people."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Beautiful garden with many beautiful plants. You can spend all day just admiring the beautiful colours of the flowers
Baguio Botanical Garden,Love the new look after renovation. My wife and I spent 2 hours enjoying the gardens.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"A lot has changed, this has become a maze of internationally themed and local craftsmanship. Too crowded and difficult to park unless someone will be left behind in the car just to monitor the traffic. The Japanese ""cave"" is filled with mud and a very narrow path although it is only a short distance the darkness can put someone at risk for slipping, just take a pic outside there's nothing inside that cave."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Very cheap entry fee of 10 php per person. $0.23 CAD. There's many themes throughout the park to take some memorable and beautiful pictures with. We stayed for an hour-ish and we didn't even have time to see or take pictures with half of the themes in this park. One of our funniest moments was the cut-out picture we took of the old native tribe of Baguio mountain. A custom photo for some of these photos was 250 pesos.There was a Canadian sign and a little garden too from Vaughn, Ontario if you're a tourist from Canada like I am. There are also themes from other countries too like Japan and China."
Baguio Botanical Garden,I am wondering if I had ever been there. I don't recognize it at all. Love the place! Glad I (re)discovered it.
Baguio Botanical Garden,The admission fee per person(adult) is only 10php. A very nice place to walk around.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Lots of nice flowers and plants. And they even sell plants ranging from 50-250 pesos. We got some nice cacti for 50 pesos.
Baguio Botanical Garden,GREAT EXPERIENCE! NICE FLOWERS. IGOROT COSTUME AVAILABLE FOR PICTURE TAKING FOR AFFORDABLE PRICE.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"A huge improvement for this place,They added a lot kinds of plants and flowers and Greenhouses,I like this new Botanical garden.Truly a place must see."

Baguio Botanical Garden,"Had so much fun here. For nature lovers, this is a good place to recharge. I enjoyed the mini trail in the PMEA area. A must visit place in Baguio!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"UPDATE 2: The Baguio Botanical Garden is constantly evolving. During the pandemic the local government took the opportunity to further develop and beautify the Baguio Botanical Garden. Now there are more attractions to see, like the sunflower garden, succulents and cactus garden, dahlia garden among other new and improved attractions. The Friendship parks are still there but all were improved and new attractions in each friendship parks were added. Time of Operation from 7am to 6pm.UPDATE: A lot has happened and changed since my review two years ago, for one there are now ""elephants"" and other additional places to see inside Botanical Garden. I especially like the addition of the different Chinese zodiac in the sister city China garden also that where the mining bureau had constructed their little mini forest park complete with mini waterfalls.The miniature symbolic parks of Baguio's Sister Cities are found here. I love visiting the Japanese cave. A place where it was said that it was used by Japanese soldiers as barracks during World War II."

Baguio Botanical Garden,"Visited on 09/29/2022. I visited the Botanical Garden in 2015 and as I recall there have been vast improvements since. The tunnel which was mostly bare metal before now has lush plants. Noteworthy are the plants with white roots forming a canopy that look like dainty flowers, and the yellow bell-like flowers hanging upside down. The different friendship gardens (Canadian, Chinese, Korean, Thai, etc.) are great spots for picture taking."

Baguio Botanical Garden,Very nice and relaxing place. One of the best attraction in Baguio.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Nice place to visit but not a lot of flowers to see, it's not like before."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"When you are a nature lover, you will appreciate the beauty of it."
Baguio Botanical Garden,We visited after it was newly remodeled and a lot has been improved and added. Before entering you need to pay an ₱10 entrance fee (environmental fee). A must see spot is the “London Bridge” underneath is garden of million flowers😍. Another one is the bamboo-like pathway and the newly added succulent greenhouse. Best visited on weekends (lesser crowd). 🍃✨
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Botanical Garden, Baguio CityAs is, its a garden with wide variety of plants and flowers. Good for early morning walk but its so full of tourists and residents. They collect entrance fees of ₱10 for adults and ₱5 for kids below 13yo (if im not mistaken)."
Baguio Botanical Garden,My first time to visit the garden after its renovation. Though I miss the original nature type garden however the park's modern design leveled up and can be parallel to other tourists destination. The international themed parks concept is awesome. Above all the Orchidarium & the Cactus Gardens are my favourites.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Ambience is great, lots of new stuff added."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Very relaxing, beautiful and well maintained"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"cool place, good for taking aesthetic pictures"

Baguio Botanical Garden,"Clean place, everything are organised with good securityVisible policeOne thing that needs upgrading are restrooms 🤬"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Botanical garden from then and now has improved alot. Very pretty and well maintained.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Very cheap entrance fee at 10 pesos but be very careful where you park as there is inadequate parking. You can be slapped with a 500 peso fee even late at night. Kinda predatory that they wait till you leave your car then take your plate instead of informing tourists.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"The Friendship Pavillion is a wonderful place but often missed by visitors of Baguio Botanical Garden, it is located somewhat at the corner of the Botanical Garden. So keep an eye for this attraction, I know it will be worth your visit."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Been here for 3 times already. This year 2022, the Botanical Garden is being renovated but it has changed a lot already and became more lovely 😍.Updates: There is an entrance fee amounting to 10 pesos per head"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Superb experience. The place is sooooo gorgeous.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"For P10 per head, you get more than what you pay for! Great place to stroll around and relax even if it's right along a busy street. There are a lot of areas to take pictures and sit down. There are a few coffee and snack stalls with tables scattered within the premises. We were able to park near the entrance since we came early but we saw a lot of cars already along Leonard Wood road since parking is limited. We went October 2022, the Japanese Tunnel didn't have any lights inside, maybe still being repaired. It was wet and so dark even with 2 cellphone flashlights so we were only able to enter a few meters in. Other attractions are open already. Our favorite was the cactus exhibit and the open area with flowers.Clean toilet with P7 fee."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Small place but the area is beautiful!
Baguio Botanical Garden,What a beautiful and great experience you can have here. It was my wife and my first time to visit baguio so we stopped by and visit the Baguio Botanic Garden. We was able to spend a good half a day here just walking around. So many beautiful pictures can be taken with stunning flowers and amazing plants. The air is so fresh and the atmosphere is just so welcoming. There is a small entrance fee but it was totally worth it. Take long walks around the gardens see the stunning creations and even the little mine/tunnels in the gardens. Enjoy you're visit here with plenty of time and ready yourself for so many photos. There are very little staff around and it's very peaceful. There is a photo opportunity at the entrance. There are toilets here to with standard fee. I highly recommend visiting here and I sure will be doing so again in the future with more friends and family.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It's drizzling when we went here, so i didn't have muc of a photo to share 😉"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Cold and nice place...
Baguio Botanical Garden,Many attractions and has so much fresh air. 😍
Baguio Botanical Garden,A wonderful place to visit. Be there early to enjoy the ambience and weather. 10 pesos entrance fee for adults  5 pesos for kids.

Baguio Botanical Garden,A place close to nature! ❤️
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Fantastic!The local botanical gardens in Sarasota Florida (Selby Gardens), probably has a budget that is 20 times larger, however Baguio city botanical gardens are vastly superior.Well done Baguio Philippines!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Ang gandaaa, it’s full of beautiful and colorful flowers."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Pleasantly surprised to have this as my favorite part of our little vacation   You don't need to be a plantita to enjoy seeing the cute cacti and the pretty flowers. The amenities are good (Mom was impressed with the nice bathroom lol). There are some snacks along the way (milk tea, fries and a cafe at the front). An ampitheater type thing in the middle and little ""exhibits"" (a Thai garden, Korean Garden, and a greenhouse full of succulents). If you are inspired you can but some of the plants to start your own garden. Would recommend."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Very nice place. Thoughtful that they thought about adding wheelchair access. Except that it is a bit too narrow, specially on the u turns."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Date of visit 2019 Dec 22.Time of visit 3.30 pm to 4.00 pm.Sight Seeing 8.5.Ambience 9.Price Free.Expected exploration time 1 to 2 hours.Sight Seeing: This is a large and beautiful garden that should not be missed. There are plenty of spaces to visit, many photo spots, various photo booths, different garden themes and even a sheltered area where you can shop for souvenirs. The wide variety of activities adds depth to the beautiful garden.Ambience: The air is fresh and clean as expected."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I think this place you can see good arrangement of flower and you can buy plant like lucky bamboo, etc. You can wear igorot dress and take a selfie with it. And they have new display of structure which many tourist can visit here. You can also buy pasalubong or You can dine at their reastaurant if you are hungry. Facilities have improve in modern way."
Baguio Botanical Garden,One of the most suggested and low-cost itenerary in Baguio at 10php. I highly suggest this place as it is not just your usual park. The place is wonderful with food stores inside so you'll get to eat when you're hungry. The prices of the flowery plants are affordable. You can also have a short trail of walk going up and a spectacular cave experience. I highly encourage to include this in your list and I'm pretty sure you will go back again after as part of your Baguio itenerary.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Well maintained and keeps improving
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Fresh air, relaxing environment."
Baguio Botanical Garden,how beautiful the different kinds of plants along the Botanical
Baguio Botanical Garden,"The place has somehow improved (garden statues or sculptures and landscape) compared to the last time we visited years ago. Unfortunately, it was about to rain when we started to stroll around so we immediately went back to our car; Will definitely visit this again and bring umbrellas."
Baguio Botanical Garden,What a makeover! Quite enchanting!
Baguio Botanical Garden,Great improvement! Their Christmas display is worth the queing. Very clean and the garden was well kept.
Baguio Botanical Garden,New look of Baguio botanical garden
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Pretty. Even if it is crowded sure you'll find a space. The souvenirs here is sold on a market price, for that this is a good place to shop. The place is clean and well preserved. The elephant statues are cute as well. The place is really big and awesome.It will be great to visit this place."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I really enjoyed the place, with tons of different varieties of lovely plants and flowers. Best of all, the entrance fee is totally free! You can also buy some of the plants so you can grow them at home, and the price they give is very reasonable. Definitely would recommend going here before you climb Mines View Deck"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Beautiful place! Me and my lady had a blast walking through this beautiful and peaceful garden.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It's just ok even for a first timer. Nothing special. It pales in comparison to other botanical gardens. It also somewhat overrated. As being list in numerous sites at a must see. You can scrape this place of your planned activities if ever you're in Baguio. I was feeling a little pity otherwise I would have given it 1 star. As you can tell by the pictures, there are so few (if there is one) beautiful flowers or garden section in this place."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Loved the beautiful flowers, sturdy trees, manicured gardens, and public art. For a park that does not charge admission fees and sees a constant stream of visitors, I thought this place is kept reasonably tidy and well-maintained. It’s a great place to while away time and escape the congestion of the city. There are shops and food stalls near the entrance."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Enjoyed going around the place
Baguio Botanical Garden,Perfect place for nature lovers or for those who wants to scape their stress for a while 😁. It's like you entered a different dimension as this garden will welcome you with an embrace from mother nature. Very quiet. Great place as well for walking and picture taking.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Construction is still on going so discomfort is expected. They dont have any entrance fee! You could roam around and enjoy the garden. There is also a cave which is enhanced and too small for large crowds.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I only got to see the garden today after it has been renovated years ago and was impressed on how it has improved. I'm glad that Baguio has improved the garden but still, with a lot of improvements to make. It is definitely one place to visit when in Baguio.The elephant statues were a hit to the tourists as well as the zodiac statues.There is a section where you could take photos with some headless native statues and wear some traditional tribal clothing with a fee. It's not bad but would have been better if they improved it showing the culture and heritage of the City."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Very beautiful place where you can bring your family and friends. Its full of beautiful attractions and cultivation. The park is so relaxing , fresh air and beautiful flowers surrounded. Many tourist visit the place its because its free and a very wonderful. Its very recommendable when you visit baguio. Me and my loving husband visit the place and we both like it. Anyone can enter the garden because its free. They have clean restrooms as well if you need it. You can also find a tall beautiful pine trees, native igorots huts and relics."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Visited here before the lockdown. Great place. A must visit when you are in Baguio.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Nice place to spend time with loved ones and take pictures, eat and relax yourself with others doing the same thing."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Its a great place to just slow down and appreciate nature. There are some tables where you can have a picnic with family ot friends. Clean pay restrooms are available.The souvenir stores near the garden entrance are a few but offer a good selection of items to take home as souvenir. Prices are a bit cheaper here compared to souvenir stores in mines view.
Baguio Botanical Garden,A garden beautifully  reimagined. A must see when your in baguio.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Free entrance. The park is quite big and there are many picturesque views. There are also stores of dry goods and plants situated near the entrance. You may want to experience and take pictures wearing the native cordilleran attire for 20 pesos per head only.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Baguio Botanical Garden improved alot since the last time I've been here.Just be wary when you take pictures outside specifically BBG's outside signage because you will be approached by elderly people wearing traditional clothes and be stern but polite in declining taking photos with them. Still a must visit when in Baguio.#LetLeniLead
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Baguio Botanical Garden has been a revitalizing place, we love to visit, just walk around and feel the breeze."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Nice place with plenty of spots for picture taking.🌷
Baguio Botanical Garden,Just fall in love with the nature calls...
Baguio Botanical Garden,"No entrance fee, it's totally free.The park is well-kept, the plants are maintained. Great for photo ops. You can bring your own food for picnic, or you can try dining in the park's cafe. Baguio souvenirs are available here, even plants in pots. You can see some bees in action here. It's walking distance to Wright Park and The Mansion. Pretty neat place considering it's free."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Very beautiful flowers and the landscapes, wow, sooo nice guys"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It was magical. Specifically the fern garden beside the japanese tunnel. Though not all visitors consider this place(so many people outside but only we were three people to explore it). Anyway, for me, as a plant eunthusiast, it was like heaven. There are so many rare species of fern plants, endanger and epedemic. If there are plants lovers out there or fern lovers, this place is a must. I guaranteed!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,A beautiful experience really. Something you have to see (experience) to believe. ✨
Baguio Botanical Garden,Nice garden with Chinese theme plus a few elephants and a nice bridge. There's also man made tunnels apparently used by the Japanese during World War 2. It's a good place to spend some time with the family and take some pictures. Don't forget to support the Igorots running the tribal costume shop as it's very cheap and provides lots of fun trying them out and pose for pictures.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Very relaxing! Great experience in a very affordable price.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Love this place. Downside limited parking. But once you get inside it’s absolutely gorgeous. Well taken care of. Plenty of spots to take pictures. Cave was cool, didn’t expect it to be so large. Beautiful place to take family and relax."
Baguio Botanical Garden,The place is so beautiful! Although it was rainy afternoon but i still had fun roaming around the garden. I would like to come and visit again. But I have to make sure to come in the morning. Not to worry about lunch because there is a restaurant nearby serves delicious foods snacks and coffee.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"A very relaxing place, just don't go there during peak season."
Baguio Botanical Garden,You have a lot of things to see in Botanical Garden.. I am a Baguio girl but haven't been there for a long time.. I went there recently and I have seen a lot of development.. You'll certainly enjoy going around and seeing replicas of parks around the world.
Baguio Botanical Garden,This place has improved a lot. Sulit ang 10php na entrance.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Place is well-maintained. The entrance fee is only 10 pesos. There isn't much to see here except nature.
Baguio Botanical Garden,This place is really beautiful ❤️.. very relaxing ambience and it's really nice
Baguio Botanical Garden,4 stars because I liked the place. They have friendly staff.  Not 5 stars because some parts of the place didn't look like ready-for-tourists. But I must say that they're working on improvements.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I love the place! Very calming, relaxing and refreshing :) Real growing trees and flowers at least to visit for free, for a free attraction, I was so impressed with the variety and quality of the grounds and variety of plant life. The attraction is very popular with the locals who are kind of loud and it disturbs the peace of being able to sit near flowers and listen to nature. it is a nice place to just sit down and relax, take a leisurely stroll along its narrow and winding pathways and also enjoy the landscape where you will find numerous plants and trees. Tourist should treasure, respect the place.I hope they beautify this more and maintain the garden"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Nice place to spend a couple of hours in the morning. There are a lot people taking photos in the Instagram parking lot in the centre but there are some quieter areas where you can have a short walk. All the breeds of cacti were pretty cool too.Souvenir stalls at the back selling all the typical Baguio souvenirs.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I've been living here in Baguio for a couple years now but this is the first time I've been here. I never thought the park would be so spacious with lots of adventures inside. Inside you will see a very robust vegetation, lots of garden pathways, Chinese and Japanese parks, a cave (Yes, there is a cave inside! 😁), and there are also elephants! I must have been here earlier. I never thought I would be missing this much from Baguio if I haven't been here today. Hopefully this park can be maintained and our folks from the tourists won't destroy it. ☺️"
Baguio Botanical Garden,*A better Botanical Garden*  a  great place to commune with nature* cool and refreshing* great for family
Baguio Botanical Garden,Beautiful garden different kinds if flowers.love the millions .
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I visited this place one time with friends. We take a lot of pictures in here. There was also a Japanese tunnel in here, according to history, this tunnel was excavated for the Japanese to hide from their enemies. Its quite interesting since the place was actively renovating itself. There are a lot of colorful flowers and places to take a picture on it."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I often overlook this place whenever I go to Baguio until the last time when we decided to enter to check what's inside. Surprised when we saw a Japanese tunnel, and these replicas of parks and landmarks of countries like Japan, South Korea, America, China, Canada and Thailand. Very interesting place for those who are fond of taking pictures and for those who like walking around surrounded by the beauty of nature."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Good place to relaxed and injoy the nature
Baguio Botanical Garden,Old but gold. Long time tourist destination in Baguio. Garden is well kept and maintained. Open from 6am to 6pm daily. Friendship statues from other countries are also designed all over the garden.
Baguio Botanical Garden,I was so surprise when the locals approach me when i ask for a friend to take a photo of me. Like a lot of them and after that they said that we have to pay them😂😂😂. I thought they just wanted to join me. You'll have a chance to take a photo wearing their native dress in front of their native house for only Php20.00. I've seen a lot of bonsais inside that you need to pay Php10.00 if you wanted to take a photo with it. You'll experience another 2 countries inside. We get to experience a bit of Korea and China. They also have a little cave inside which i find it kinda creepy so i did not explore it. Along the Chinese country side you'll with the birth year signs. It's very refreshing inside and there's a lot to see. They said that they have renovated it. Outside the garden is where i found the strawberry taho with ube flavor😋😋😋
Baguio Botanical Garden,Soo  nice gardens ..festive walking at night.. nice place fOr family bonding moments
Baguio Botanical Garden,I love it. The weather in Baguio was sunny but the wind was chilling. The flowers were beautiful and the place is good. There are statues all around the place. Statues of Chinese zodiacs and some statues Idk about.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Well worth the upcoming entrance fee increase. The park is well maintained.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"The place has improved a lot, and seems that more improvements are coming soon.  The entrance fee is just 10pesos. the place closes at 6:30pm. As for the parking, it is a bit hard to find a spot."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Beautiful garden.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"This is also one of Baguio City's attractions and is a great place to unwind, sight see, have a quite time for one self and have a group picnic. The place is surrounded by verdant and lust vegetation and water elements. Cordillerans in their cultural attires are near the signage ready for you to take pictures with but with a pay.😁"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Baguio's Botanical Garden has changed a lot through the years. It's still a great place to stroll and take nice pictures. This place is a classic, and every tourist in Baguio should visit this place at least once. If your time in Baguio is limited, I suggest to only have a quick visit here as other places in Baguio offer much more."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Feels awesome😍very beautiful and so clean.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Here you can immerse yourself in the natural beauty of Baguio amidst the Urban Sprawl of the city.

Baguio Botanical Garden,Beautiful gardens.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Newly renovated!So much better.Must revisit again
Baguio Botanical Garden,"The best thing about this place is its walkability and the chance it gives you to explore its features. The flora was fascinating and refreshing, especially during the early hours of its opening hours. The different displays of architecture from different parts of the world was very interesting. However, one of the best features of the botanical garden is the tunnel built by the Japanese during WW2 found at the remote parts of the site. One annoying thing here is the blue pay toilets which would only open supposedly at 7:30 AM."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"The place is huge and super nice, it rained when we went here so we were not able to explore it fully. Make sure to visit the souvenir shops here too! They sell souvenirs at a low price, e.g Keychains = 15 for 100 unlike in night market where they sell 10 pesos for 1 keychain."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Clean and newly renovated
Baguio Botanical Garden,cool breeze nice place cheap entrance fee

Baguio Botanical Garden,Super relaxing.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"The Baguio Botanical Garden is one Baguio City’s attractions. It is a great place to unwind because it is surrounded by lush vegetation and water elements. It’s located in Leonard Wood Road, just a few minutes away from the Central Business District. You can pass it when you’re on your way to Wright Park, The Mansion, and Mines View Park."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Good place to visit but too long to wait for the queue
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Baguio botanical garden is nice place to have serenity walks or meditate. We visited the place on a tuesday morning so the place is so peaceful during our visit. There are lots of pine trees in the place and themed gardens (chinese, canadian, japanese and they will be opening korean themed garden soon). There are paid comfort rooms inside but you can visit the place for free. There are several affordable souvenir shops inside the park. Most of their souvenir products are cheaper than shops in Mines View Park."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Very Greenery and Lovely Place
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Free park good for the kids young and old, when trying to get pictures in front the native dressed old women will get in your pictures even though we didn't want them, then they wanted 50 pesos they finally took 30 after they got mad when I gave the old haggs 20 pesos. You can take a jeep from the plaza directly outside the gate of Brigham park. Then jump on the jeeps again going to mineview. Do not miss this park for your vacation 📷"
Baguio Botanical Garden,The place is neat and clean.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Baguio Botanical Garden (BBG) - perfect place to help you unwind, relax, feel nature at its finest and of course take a photo of the different plant species. Don't worry for the parking lot, there will be guides for you to park. No entrance fee, just the parking fee. 😅 There are also plants available inside the park, even souvenir items are available. There are different places like the improved Filipino-Chinese Friendship Park, there is also a wishing well and a cave inside the BBG, and of course the rich heritage and culture of the locals in Baguio. There are still renovations and improvements ongoing. There are also clean comfort rooms inside the garden. I also really enjoyed reading some facts about different plant species that are present in the garden. Highly recommended to visit BBG when you are here in Baguio City. Try also the Strawberry Taho!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"One of the most famous landmarks in Baguio. A good place to take the family for a weekend bonding or picnic and connect with nature. There's a stall inside where one could have an opportunity of being photographed wearing the traditional costume of the Cordillerans. Of course, it comes with a minimal fee. There are also a number of peddlers selling bits and pieces of souvenirs handmade in Baguio. Near the entrance, there's a corner that sells paintings and other arts & crafts. Also, clothings and accessories are sold. There's also a nook for refreshments and snacks.Only thing i didn't like in my experience was when an old Ifugao woman angrily approached me to ask for a ""payment"" (P20 pesos for each one of them) because she noticed that i was taking a photo of her together with a couple of other local tourists! She was very insistent to see my mobile phone as proof that i indeed took a photo of her and her group! I was totally flabbergasted! 🤤 I wasn't even denying because for me it was a spontaneous reaction seeing her group clad in those colorful and attractive outfits, who wouldn't be enticed to take a shot? It never occurred to me that everything comes with a fee these days incl. innocently taking a pic.. haha! No money, no honey! 😂😂 To settle the brouhaha and as peace offering, i've volunteered to give each one of them the ""fee"" required so long as i get my photo taken with them! 😉 And they've all agreed happily! All's well that ends well! We've became close later! 😃😍 Funny thing was, as soon as my nephew started clicking his cam to take our photos, the other natives started running towards our position aiming to join our pictorial.. hahaha! OMG! I've no more P20 bucks to spare! So, we've abruptly finished off with our photo ops. So long, my grandmas in another life! 😜❤❤❤"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Beautiful and amazing place to relax 😘😍 its more meaningful to visit if you will visit with someone you love...
Baguio Botanical Garden,The place is newly renovated. The 10 peso entrance fee is more than worth it of what you'll see inside.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Must visit if you are in Baguio. If you are going to take a pic with an Igorot costume...I'd choose this place over Mines View. It's spacious so it can accomodate the tourists well.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Worth the price. Unlike Maryknoll sactuary which is scam 75pesos not worth the money. This is only 10 pesos and what's inside the park are pricesless. MARYKNOLL is a budol, scam place."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Perfect for taking pictures and for nature lovers but needs more care and maintenance for some spots. I bought a honey from a guy outside the park worth P80.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"My churchmates visited this place in Baguio last Nov.2,  2018. As we walked inside, there are huts that rents igorot costumes for P20 each to be put on for picture taking. We enjoyed taking pictures around the area with nipa huts and different plants."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Its way more beautiful before. The plants are no longer that good. Before there was no entrance fee. Now that it has fee its uglier. Lack of maintenance. There is also trashes on the pond where the koi fish are, so sad😔"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Baguio Botanical Garden is a place when you wanted to buy flowers or plants on a pot for indoor or outdoor ornaments, an overview of a garden with different sights to take a picture especially if for instagram or DP purposes and not but the least a very accomodating i think igorot natives who would be ready for a picture taking and do hand gestures such as heart finger(k-pop). There also stalls for taking picture for placing your head on a igorot statue and if you feel to try the igorot costume they can also lend you in exchange for an amount of money.Try to visit this place even on a noon time the humid was cold and you'll feel the welcoming ambiance."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Here are the reasons why it is a must destination when in Baguio:Spacious - still roomy even with influx of visitorsAccessible - only PhP8 fare from the city properNear other tourist spots - Wright Park, Mansion, Mines View, etcLots of different kinds of flowers (for your selfies)Clean and well-maintainedAffordable souvenir itemsIt's global - Baguio had a lot of sister cities and most parts of the botanical garden are build through the cooperation with its sister cities like the Friendship Pavilion and mini park (Hangzhou, China), Taebaek Park (Taebaek City, South Korea), Golden Gate Bridge replica (Vallejo, California, USA), Vaughan (Ontario, Canada) and its latest attraction, the Thai Elephant.And most of all - it's FREE."

Baguio Botanical Garden,"You can wear igorot costumes there and I'm not sure if you have to pay for the costumes or for free. You'll find there a tunnel made by Japanese, and most funny is that we found two dragon flies and we don't know exactly what they're doing hehe."

Baguio Botanical Garden,"Great place for field trips, picnics and walking. Baguio's sister cities are well represented in the park. The horses for rent as well as vendors in the park have been removed already, which i think,  helped clean up the park. It's well maintained but could stand to have a few more trash bins in the area."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Beautiful garden sceneries and a bunch of different species of flowers.
Baguio Botanical Garden,The place seems great but it was still close when we went.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"The new Botanical Garden is far better than itwas before. Considering that they only collect Php10.00 for environment fee, it is worth your visit."

A cave but wasn't able to check it out since I was having separation anxiety(kidding) with the family baggage, I had no choice even tho I wanted to roam around. All in all it was pleasing and fulfilling since I was able to feed fish with my left over bread crumbs. Prepare your artistic minds to get a lot of photos."

Baguio Botanical Garden,"Baguio Botanical Garden, after its renovation, now looks amazing and more organized. Our legs hurt just when we were about to finish all their trails. They have a minimal entrance fee (PHP10 for adults, PHP5 for children below 12), but its worth the try and I promise you will never regret it. Even their toilet is extravagant. They also have a designated trash bin and equipment for your pets when they leave their waste. Overall, it's a tiring but satisfying roam through the newly renovated Baguoo Botanical Garden. I hope you add it to your list of To Go places when you visit the Summer Capital of the Philippines, Baguio City."

Baguio Botanical Garden,Great park!
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Near the city. Just one jeepney ride and hola, u are at the place already..."
Baguio Botanical Garden,It was definitely not worth the trip not even the cheap P10 entrance. In fairness there was a lot of renovation signs abound but they should have warned the public. Everything was a mess and untidy. No signs or directions posted on were to go and assist people. No one within the grounds were implementing covid protocols all i saw was the motions at the entrance. Sadly it used to be a beautiful and refreshing place to visit.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Won't regret visiting ds place,.4 stars muna ngaun since under renovation ibang parts,,wil surely rate it 5stars soon aftr improvements r done😉"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Beautiful place, everything is so pleasing  to the eyes."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Beautiful garden..
Baguio Botanical Garden,"nice garden , rare plants  and clean place"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It's a great walking hike of gorgeously maintained plants and flowers. They added children park animals and characters as well, so kids can enjoy it. Also, the entrance is free. Over on the top, or towards the entrance, you'd see a bunch of tiny shops that offer everything from woven handbags to snowballs (quite yummy Russian tea cake cookies in a jar) and jams. The only thing I wish they had maintained is maybe the trellis leading to the children's areas and put some vines there, like orchids, or made it a floral arch. Overall, nice place to relax and enjoy a good 5000 steps or so if you're in Baguio."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Very good place to walk
Baguio Botanical Garden,Clean and quiet. Calm and peaceful.
Baguio Botanical Garden,4 yrs ago when i came back here. its like this. now its more scenic

Baguio Botanical Garden,"Very popular tourist attraction for locals. Free entry.  Features sculptures representing the local traditions AND Bagiuo's friendship with other nations. Expansive garden, good for walking. The pathways are not paved which might be difficult to walk on if it's raining. There are plenty of picnic tables and benches.  Plenty of souvenirs available for sale.  Toilets available on site.  Not pram & wheelchair friendly. Parking is an issue as there's only limited spots available; traffic around the area is stand-still or moving at walking pace."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It was so full of flowers, of different kinds. 😍"
Baguio Botanical Garden,A good place to spend your afternoon with nature.

Baguio Botanical Garden,So refreshing and relaxing..
Baguio Botanical Garden,It's good but on the afternoon there's a ton of people
Baguio Botanical Garden,I love nature. This place is very relaxing. It would be better to visit the garden in the morning.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It is monsoon season when I visited. No flowers blooming, it was all muddy paths and nothing to appreciate. This was in July.

Baguio Botanical Garden,Variety of flowers. Different themes from country sponsors.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Newly renovated! 100x better! must visit!
Baguio Botanical Garden,It's an Atok and Camp John Hay's Secret Garden rolled into one.
Baguio Botanical Garden,A picturesque place that offers instragrammable opportunities for everyone. Make sure to bring good camera as the lightnings can get tricky depending on the weather. The best thing about this is that there is no entrance fee.Try to explore every inch of the garden because every nook offers a pleasant surprise.Make sure to visit early because it can get crowded especially on weekends.
Baguio Botanical Garden,My family had fun roaming around the area and taking pictures to preserved the memory of how much we enjoyed the place. It's like a collaboration of different cultures in one place. And the flowers and plants are added bonus with their beautiful colors fused together to create a diversed beauty. Hmmm...I love nature. Oh...the comfort rooms are clean 😊

Baguio Botanical Garden,A place where you can take some clicks and buy some souvenir.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Must see and its free. The Filipino Chinese friendship garden is cool to see. Make sure you follow every path. We found some very cool hidden areas like caves and waterfalls that nobody else was up by. There was even a little house hidden up on one of the hills with a dog. The statues of the elephants were great. One of them is ""anatomically correct"" which was kinda a shock; but they sure are life-like beautiful statues. The mini golden gate bridge was an interesting find. I specifically liked the Buddha steps leading to the closed bathroom and the caves."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Had a great time here. Very fresh air and lots of nice benches. There are some corny photo areas but there are also some cool paths noone seems to notice that are really cool. The hanging orchids are amazing.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Beautiful day and night,"

Baguio Botanical Garden,A quiet place to unwind with the family. So many features. Its like an international park with scenic spots. Great to walk around. And its free entrance. They are open until 6pm.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Beautiful place
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Sometimes when I come here there are almost no blooming flowers but this time, since it's the Panagbenga Festival, lots of flowers are blooming - especially Sunflowers. Quite sunny and hot when the wind isn't blowing though. Still a good and relaxing walk along nature."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"This botanical garden is a must-see spot in Baguio City. You can see lots of beautiful plants and flowers there, from yellow cosmos to poinsettia. You will enjoy the cool breeze as you walk inside the area, and you can also see beautiful statues and statuettes of different animals (with the inclusion of Chinese zodiac animals).

Baguio Botanical Garden,"Nice place. Lots of plants in there. Duh!

Baguio Botanical Garden,Nice experience at the Japanese Cave. =)
Baguio Botanical Garden,Well-kept garden for a free admission tourist spot. Nice place to just chill and appreciate flora and feline fauna (many cats). Bring and clean your own picnic munchies.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Really enjoyed this place. At the time I visited the plants were limited due to a recent disaster but I felt there's a good mixture of things to see and do. There's a cave, landmarks, statues, eateries and small shops. Very pleasant and beautiful."
Baguio Botanical Garden,The place is huge. The garden is divided into separate themes all over Asia and is a good place to take photos. Some of the set up specifically the Korean and Japanese gardens are very closely cloned so taking pictures there would look like you being I. Those countries.The gift shops are also be comprehensive and in just one place so shopping is very easy.I also like the fact that to could buy a lot of plants such as herbs and succulents and other ornamental plants from there.They entrance is also free! Unless you would have a car then there is a minimal parking fee.This is also very close to the Wright park so you could just walk a little bit and be there as well.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Great place to go for a few hours to walk around and see all the flora of the area. Some great small monuments as well. Make sure to get your picture taken out front of you visit Bagiuo!

Baguio Botanical Garden,Good place to buy souvenirs. Prices are low. Perfect place for strolling as well.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Baguio is obviously the land of photo ops, almost everywhere is a good place to snap some photos, including this one. The cave has been closed unfortunately. In case you get hungry,  try to shy away from the restaurant by the entrance because it id expensive, and the serving is,  well, they could do better."
Baguio Botanical Garden,good place to visit and clean
Baguio Botanical Garden,Very nice place.  Relaxed and Cozy feeling.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It is a nice place. For first timer going there, it is fine but for old timer like me, I would suggest the Baguio administration at least maintain the truthfullness of its name Botanical Garden. The place needs more plants and flowers to uphold its name."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Underwhelming place. Small, not well kept up. Just plain boring."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Nice view and you will learn lots of scientific name of various plants.

Baguio Botanical Garden,"Time to appreciate nature and its best warriors, plants and trees together with birds and bees.😁"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Place for nature/park lovers
Baguio Botanical Garden,Not too much to do here except to shoot a few photos. No parking area. The natives hanging out at the botanical garden signage outside will charge you P100 if you have your picture taken with them. A friend once mentioned that the Minesview park looks more of a garden (because of the interesting variety of bonsai and other potted plants) than the botanical garden itself.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It is still a good place to explore and take photo here in Baguio. This place is considered a tourist spot so expect heavy crowed and difficult parking. Its best time to go here in the morning or very late in the afternoon. You will see different types and colors of flowers. Unfortunately its not that pristine anymore, hope someone could really direct this place to restore its former beauty. Over all its a free place to go."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Newly renovated with a lot of flowers.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Nice compact gardens with many points of interest,  mostly non-botanical,  but all over well done.  Markets there if you like,  ladies in traditional garb if you want to pay for photo."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Good place for photoshoot with family and friends.
Baguio Botanical Garden,A very lovely place
Baguio Botanical Garden,A place of my memories. A place that had been changed over the years. I hope the new redevelopment will be pushed further to beautify this park. I'm expecting it a lot better than when I used to live here when it was still a Botanical Garden.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Not sure if it was just the timing but when we visited last June 14, we couldn't see that much flowers. It's still a nice place to visit, I love the trees and the general ambiance."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Good place to appreciate nature
Baguio Botanical Garden,Nice place to go as a family
Baguio Botanical Garden,One of the beautiful places in baguio city.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Beautiful landscaping! International gardens (Japanese, Chinese, etc.) are beautifully sculptured! Aged trees abound. Cool even on a sunny and hot day! Nature at its best! Stress relieving. . ."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Some changes were made over time. I just wish they painted or styled the railings on the pathway to complement the garden, the metal railings just look out of place. Also, instead of using tiles on some areas they should've used stones/bricks/rocks/more natural-looking tiles."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Truly and enjoyable walk on real grass, dirt and some walk ways.  Not a sanitized, stay off the grass.  Truly a wonderful, wild, fun walk amongst real foliage.  Love this rustic place."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Relaxing place. You can see different plant species, as the place's name suggest. Some plants are already off-season (from flowering) from the time of visit so we are not able to see the full bloom. The Garden Diner is also a must-try"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Just okay. The place needs some attention for improvement.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It is still the place to go to see nice landscape. The place is crowded. My kids loved running around the garden. If you are in Baguio and you missed it, it won't be the end of the world, but still a go to place in Baguio"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Nice place to visit...
Baguio Botanical Garden,So green and so nice
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Currently under renovation until further notice. We tried to visit here last July 17,2021. Only souvenir shops are open in this area."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Beautiful place to relax.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Love the newly rennovated place!
Baguio Botanical Garden,Such a peaceful place. Excellent view
Baguio Botanical Garden,Botanical Gardens is currently undergoing renovations with great new additions to the park. Some parts of the park is in disrepair such as rotting wood carvings and areas overgrown with weeds. Just stay clear of those areas and you can enjoy the rest of the park.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Don't miss this place when your in baguio,"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Place is just a walk with the nature and nothing else uncommon. Mines View is better when listing the names of the plants in the garden and selling them. Theres always shops to buy souvenirs as always in every place in Baguio. There should be a map of the place, what to expect and showing the beauty of the place."
Baguio Botanical Garden,At first we thought that we already explore all the places but actually we miss going to some point to another.. though there are some other things that are under developed and under construction the place is great and we enjoyed it as a family.. We are planning to go back next year.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Good place to visit
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Place has been developed very well but some trees were cut and they should provide more seats for tourists. Also, have guards or crews all over the place to prevent vandalism, and wrong doings of tourists"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Lovely must go back to the summer city city of pines
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Be careful of the old women wearing Ifugao costumes, because they'll extort money from you even if you don't want them to be in the picture. Do not take pictures of yourselves outside of the place. The interior is quite peaceful and has a wide view. You will enjou it if you like plants and flowers."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"This place hss no entrance fee and they have very wide area. This place has a lot of weird good things I saw while going around. Just like the tunnel, statues, plants and etc. You will see a lot of cultures from different places of asia."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Baguio Botanical is a classic example of a tourist trap. Nothing to see here really. The garden is badly maintained. No exemplary species of plants that will compell you to visit the place. Heck, my aunt's garden looks much more interesting than this."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Perfect Place for group, lovers,  nice climate and ambiance, clean. Hope more flowers will be groomed. and hope that plants / trees have identification for educational purposes"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Excellent. Well order again
Baguio Botanical Garden,i must say that the only highlight was wearing the traditional costume for some awesome phototaking. more care have to be given to the garden's pathway. there were lots of still water after the rain.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Place is ongoing beautification project.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Very nice and historical
Baguio Botanical Garden,"The garden is good fo4 taking photos with such beautiful backgrounds. But some of the pathways are rigged, just take extra careful when walking on these paths"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"A variety of plants n experiences. There is a japanese tunnel to explore. They showcase different types of gardens. Very educational too because they labeled the plants complete with name and a short description. They have souvenir shops which not only sells Baguio souvenirs but also artworks by Baguio artists. The entrance was made so as it would be convenient for the elderly and disabled persons in wheelchairs to enter. Unfortunately, it would be difficult for them to explore the whole place."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"A great place for nature lovers and those who  like to walk. All plants labeled with name and brief description etc. Safe for kids , couple of nice restaurants placed so you get a nice view."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Some part here lack of warnings and directions especially the cave as its very dark inside and slippery. Please make cautions. And I'll give 5 stars.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Very clean well maintained
Baguio Botanical Garden,Nice place. It has changed a lot since the start of pandemic..
Baguio Botanical Garden,"The place is very clean and with new attractions. If you want to relax and be refreshed by nature, this is the place to visit in Baguio. Be energized and awed by the plants, flowers and some of the statues of the place."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"As for this site.. ""Has Been"" is a good word.. Over populated, less features.. i just hope that 'Garden' don't go missing someday... Traffic is so heavy that before you enjoy it you're already annoyed."
Baguio Botanical Garden,A NICE tourist spot in Baguio

Baguio Botanical Garden,It s a cool. place to visit ..You can took photos inside and rent their katutubo cultural dress for only 10 php or 20 php..No food stall inside the garden..
Baguio Botanical Garden,This was my assuming-venue expectation offer. 😂😂😂
Baguio Botanical Garden,"If it’s your 3rd to 5th time in Baguio, it’s worth it to come here. It’s a big place that’s pretty dead (meaning, there didn’t seem to be weekend markets or many people who picnic), but it looks like it could have potential if maintained properly. There are distinct areas, e.g., Japanese Garden, Chinese Garden."
Baguio Botanical Garden,There were many beautiful herbal plants and flowers I only seen here in Botanical. The place was very refreshing and the scenic view was very relaxing.
Baguio Botanical Garden,Nice view
Baguio Botanical Garden,Best tourist spot in Baguio

Baguio Botanical Garden,"This place is good especially for kids, mixture of educational and enjoyment.  Our little boy find it very exciting particularly the tunnel and very happy for .meeting new friends."
Baguio Botanical Garden,I'm not sure am I too critical but... definitely have lots of room for improvement and regular upkeep is needed. I would expect that such a place would be run by people s who really love botany.
Baguio Botanical Garden,nice n clean
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Went to the park and it felt like being in Burnham park. For a fee of 10.00PHP, it is underwhelming. Parking available. Not accessible for wheelchair. Shops sell the same items as they sell Mines View Park."
Baguio Botanical Garden,safe place. scenix view
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Pleasant, peaceful oasis in the middle of all that grey!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Nice place
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Parks in Baguio such as these are losing its charm over the years due to influx of tourists and overcrowding, but the more important issue here is the lack of discipline of folks throwing trash everywhere.  Clean up your acts, people or slowly destroy your home."
Baguio Botanical Garden,Just a normal park in Baguio. Few flower species can be found here. The space was not maximised I would recommend them to add more flowers and plants all over the park/garden
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Very entertaining,beautiful place"
Baguio Botanical Garden,Probably the best nature-interacting activity without hiking through mountains. Sun rays are hot but wind is cold in shaded areas.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"For just 10 peso entrance, you can tour yourself around their spacious space. Also, 5 start for thier Cave."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"As a botanical garden, its owners should focus on rearing flora other than using poorly-designed Asian architecture that show little or no aesthetic or meaningful relevance with the landscape."

Baguio Botanical Garden,"The place is really good, there’s a lot of trees bit what we don’t want here is that when we take a photo outside some strangers photobomb with us and after the picture taking they ask as for payment, we are really shock because this is the first time we went there so we are really clueless about this things."

Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"The Baguio Cathedral is in the center of the city, just along session road. You have to climb up the famous stiff stairs but you have an option to go the other way. The Cathedral itself is huge and it's amazing as it's well maintained church though there's a lot of people going to mass. There's a Chapel that you can go to if you want a more secluded area and more peace."

You can reach it via taxi, Grab or just follow google while driving.Parking spaces are available but you will be charged per hour. There is a ticket upon entering and they’ll charge you at the exit.There is also a food court but it was closed during our visit. Restrooms have minimal charge but are clean.When we got there, we were lucky to have heard mass and see and touch the Black Nazarene visiting Baguio."

Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"Our Lady of Atonement Cathedral / Baguio CathedralOur Lady of Atonement Cathedral which is popularly known as Baguio Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral which was constructed in 1920 and got finished 1936.  It got its name from one of the titles given to Mary mother of Jesus. This church has a simple but elegant facade which (was) pink in color with rose style windows. It is located on top of Mount Mary Hill where visitors can access it using hundred steps stoneMy side story:I originally planned to come here after my appointment(Nov 4, 2021) at the Nationwide Health Systems Baguio Inc. but had to got to Triage first to secure a health certificate. God must have wanted me to go for adoration time before anything else bc there was surprisingly enormous surge of people at the place and each priority number takes a while to get accommodated on the counter. At that time they just called out for #26 and I got #56 on the line and was growing anxious waiting with the uncertain time I have left so i hopped in a cab and went to this beautiful city cathedral. The cathedral was like 5-10mins away from Triage so i figured I can spend a little more time there after saying my prayers. By the way, the cathedral is currently on renovation so I just managed to take a few photos inside and prayed at the Face of Jesus mini chapel located at the back of the cathedral. After 30mins, decided to go back to Triage and arrived just in time! My PN was called in within 5 mins! ☺️☺️☺️As to my experience, Baguio Cathedral is a great place for spiritual reawakening! Try to visit and see why I said so 😉 I truly feel blessed for being able to visit and spend some prayer time here. My prayers were actually half answered by the time I stepped out of the clinic(my appointment in Baguio). Baguio Cathedral is a new addition to my favorite places ❤️🙏❤️"

Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"A church where many events took place. I belong to the parish of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Atonement as our residence is less than half a kilometer away from this house of prayer. It is where I was baptized and its altar was where I said my “I do” when I wedded my wife in December 9, 1989. As a child, we attended mass officiated by Belgian priests and I remember Fr. John Pardou who I first received my first communion from. The church was badly damaged during the Killer Earthquake of July 1990 and it underwent a major repair for over a year. Build in 1924 by the CICM order, the majestic cathedral is adorned with two towers where bells are tolled on a regular basis. It has stained glass paintings all over but many are just colored glasses perhaps because of the impacts of the American carpet bombing during 2nd World War that actually spared the church. As a child admiring the beauties of religious art, I even dreamt of repairing or replacing the damaged mosaics but I knew that this form of ancient art is almost gone replaced by the acrylic glass and resin method. Today, one can now see a figure of Mother Frances Cabrini, an Italian nun who is known as the Patron of Immigrants. I was President of the Save our School Children Foundation which is being supported by the New York based Cabrini Mission when we had the Mosaic window of Mo. Cabrini Installed with the interventions of the late Bishop Carlito Cenzon and insistence of Sister Patricia Spillane who later became a Mother Superior of their mission. I’ve seen the transformation of the church since my kindergarten days during the time if Fr.John Pardou and Fr. Desmedt."

Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"You can also climb steep stairs from the middle of Session Road. The view is very nice. Even if you are not interested in church, I recommend you to go and see it."
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,The church is clean and quiet for those who want to pray and believe.Parking rates.Pay comfort room available.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The strawberry farm was more organized now than the last time we visited. There is a huge parking space, restrooms are also available and garbage bins. The vendors are all on the side and their food maybe affordable but not very good quality. Hope they improve on this.The farm itself has been closed to the public and we were only able to close up to the gates. Despite it being closed to the public, I think this improved the farm by maximizing the space: putting lettuce below and strawberry on top (see last photo).It was fine for me that the public cannot pick strawberries for tourist purpose because it made a healthier growing environment for the strawberries. Hope people will support this so we can improve the quality of the PH Strawberry."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,This is one of the go-to places when visiting Baguio City. You can buy fresh strawberries here at an affordable price. The vendors are really nice and funny. They sell strawberry flavored ice cream and taho which is a must try! The place is very scenic as well.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"When we decided to go to this strawberry farm we wanted to make sure we will be allowed to pick our own strawberries, we checked with hotel staffs in holiday Inn, taxi drivers we rode in past 2days, vendors in local market nobody was sure if the strawberry season was still on (May 22). No phone number to call and check if we will be still allowed to pick our own strawberries. We arrived at the farm and it is a huge disappointed, Place is full of mud (make sure you are not wearing your favourite shoes), garages, discarded veggies everywhere. Walked half way in mud only to be told there is no starberries and have to go to the other enterance and try our luck there. Picking strawberries is expensive than buying from the store nearby. (Paint my fence and see how fun it is). Overall it feels more like a tourist trap. Good for Instagram influencers."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Good for shopping, not much for sightseeing or experience. Entrance fee of 10 pesos into the farms, but nothing much to see inside, and with all the strawberries harvested, there's no strawberry picking. Even the lettuce planted in this place can't be picked. But you can buy the purple and green lettuce at 50 pesos per stalk.Large strawberry farm with different owners separated by fences. It's a proper farm with workers going to and fro with their vegetable. You can take pictures here, but most spots aren't picture worthy, just take a random view.The area sells lots of goods not limited to strawberry. Vegetables are quite cheap here compared to NCR, so if you have the space or a fridge to put your haul later on, it's the best way to spend in this spot.There's a wide collection of fruit wines from strawberry, blueberry, mangosteen, Bugnay, etc, at 200 to 250 pesos per bottle, very nice. There's also a strange snake wine with aphrodisiac components for the daring, as the seller said it can also strengthen the bone. Strawberry here are sold at 150-200 per pack of about 1/4 to 1/2 kg, a little cheaper compared to other spots in Baguio that sell strawberries at 250 pesos for less the weight.There are a few canteen style lunch options, the drinks are pricey, and there's no service water or soup to go with the meals,.be prepared to pay about 180 pesos to 500 pesos for canteen style meals.There are other odd wooden toys and items for sale in this place, and strawberry taho and strawberry ice cream (the ice shaved type) here, and lots of parking space. It's a hotspot for people into buying things. Shopping is the norm here, you'll enjoy if you brought cash. Selected vendors accept GCash too, just ask them."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Went here to pick some strawberries but unfortunately it's not yet harvest season. Nice place to buy pasalubong and of course strawberries. There were a lot of stall to choose from. Be ready to bargain so you can get big discount.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"I'm not really fond of strawberries but the ones I had in the farm and pasalubong center were good. The strawberry shakes were good, too. There were a lot of shops to buy from."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The scenery is just that great and you can buy cheaper priced strawberry goods and vegetables.Avoid fixed taxi fare coz there are passing taxis here and you won't be stranded. The fare here is like less than 200 pesos from Genesis bus terminal if no heavy traffic, but if fixed you might get charged of 600 back and forth."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"This was quite a fun experience for us. The municipality of baguio is really strict when it comes to tourists coming from neighboring towns especially to ones who came from metro-manila NCR region. Nevertheless it was a compelling assurance that the people we get in touch with are uninfected or at least vaccinated. My group had so much fun with the different products the people has showcased. What gave us more excitement was the fact that we can actually pick our own strawberry fruits. It was not an everyday experience so for us, it was rare and really special. Hope to visit the place again. The people are also very kind which made it more friendly environment. The restaurant we ate with, gave us free vegetables to take home with us. We really appreciate our time here. Thank you so much la trinidad, strawberry farm!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"They have different varieties of pasalubong/take away treats to offer. From fresh fruits and vegetables, to the sweet and satisfying jams and other delicacy.

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"An all in one shop that you can buy souvenir, local delicacies, exotic wine, fruits and vegetables.A place where you can experience strawberry picking, but at the moment that we got here its not the season for picking strawberries."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Picking strawberries is really a good experience. But coming here around April and May is already late. The berries we picked were just the leftovers. One kilogram is 500 pesos.They say that the best time to come here is February and March.From Baguio City, just take a jeep to La Trinidad and tell the driver that you will drop at the Strawberry Farm. Enjoy it!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Went here just now and there aren't a lot of strawberry farms ready for picking. There were only 2 farms among probably 15 or more. However there are a lot of stores selling all sorts of fresh produce, handicrafts, indoor and outdoor plants, jams and preserves, local delicacies, and strawberry taho (soft bean curd), sorbet, local costumes."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"It was my first time to see such a big farm. Strawberry farm located  in La Trinidad Benguet! About 6.4km from the hotel where I stayed going to the farm, 30 minutes drive via Magsaysay Avenue and Baguio- La Trinidad highway. I took Grab going there and Jeepney going back. It was just nice when I come to the place, not so hot. Though it was not strawberry picking season but i enjoyed walking around taking photos, going into souvenirs shops and shopping. There are lots of souvenirs to buy. And there i saw Snake Wine. Yes, SNAKE WINE! You dare to try? For men only! I wonder how it taste like 😂... Oh! there are fresh fruits and vegetables too."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,The strawberry farm also have different vegetable garder to choose from🍓  🥦🍆The farmers produced were really fresh and cheap. It will be a great help to them if you buy plenty of their products😊 Outside the farm are stores selling different Baguio delicacies and very affordable as well👌 Make sure to bring big ecobags!The farm is open until 5PM only🔓👍#itsmorefuninthephilippines
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"They have pick season so be sure to inquire if you can pick on your visit. There's not much at that time but you can enjoy seeing a vast field of strawberry plants. I was surprised when we found that it was flooded a few months before our visit. You can enjoy strawberry taho, strawberry ice cream and shake. A lot of store and strawberry merchandise from key chain, tshirts and hats, etc."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The best time to pay a visit at the Strawberry  Farm is between January - May as per the local farmers advise,  though you can still enjoy the farm while shopping for souvenirs, and enjoying a mouth watering strawberry ice cream.  Parking is great, comfort rooms are available for a reasonable price. Though the facility is below average,but  it's  better than nothing. Picking your own strawberries normally cost 450 pesos per kilo,  while buying readily available strawberries are just around 150-250 pesos. This place is also abundant of fresh lettuce for your salad craving."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Good place to visit strawberry farms alongwith lettuce, cabbage and cauliflowers in the valley of mountains. Always picturesque but very crowded and jammed parkings on weekends and holiday seasons. Lots of souveigneirs oprions to buy and bring back home as gifts to distribute. Dont miss the strawberry ice creams sold on bicycles."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"This place is a good spot for tourist to buy pasalubongs, it's like a one stop shop. The place is foggy, you can almost touch the clouds lol. The farm lets you to pick fresh strawberries worth 500 per basket full."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Great place to experience first hand how to pick your own strawberries. I recommend going to this place if you want it fresh and straight from the farm as some who are sold in souvenir shops are not that good quality and can be disappointing. They'll give you a good plot, for a certain time. I don't know if the price is reasonable for about 600-1000 php, if they'll charge for a hands on experience, not for the kilos. I mean, the plot doesn't have that much strawberries in it, but if you're just there for the hands on experience, go ahead. It'll be great. Nothing really new in there, just exploring the fields. Though it's a refreshing thing seeing other sets of produce of flowers blooming there, but I guess it depends on the season, or a good demo on how they plant seeds in there etc. Still, the place is great  souvenir shops and there is a whole brand of taho, the strawberry flavor, or a strawberry wine being sold. I wish I could've get the strawberry ice cream one too."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Amazing place for strawberry lovers! Lovely place with cool ambiance of Tuba Benguet. You can pick your own strawberries and other vegetables here and eat it straight from the farm but don’t forget to wash it first. At the entrance of the farm there is market/souvenir shops where you can buy lots of produce and amazing locally made stuffs. I am wanting to go back! #itsMoreFunInThePhilippines 👍🏼🙏🏻👌🏼
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"THERE'S A LOT TO SHOP HERE. Legit haha! Its like a one stop shop, its got souvenirs, veggies, fruits, plants and STRAWBERRIES! Entrance fee is free, you just have to register prior to entering the farm per se. Each farm is owned and controlled by various owners. Each has their own policy and kind of crop being planted. Some farms are closed during our visit. It would cost you 250php for a kilo of strawberry and 500php if you would opt to pick the strawberries yourself. There's a bunch of stores within the farm compound that sell veggies, souvenirs, food, ornamental plants, etc."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"if you plan to experience harvesting your own berries then you have to go here around december to january. my friends and i went in November and it's planting season but they have bunch of lettuce you can buy for a very economical and fair price. also, they have this small market nearby where you can buy some famous pasalubongs like jams, wines, brooms, vegetables  etc..."

Not just of fresh strawberries awaits but the chance of picking them on your own. You'll get to enjoy the whole place. There are lots of local stores that offers strawberry wine and other starwberry products, there are souvenir stores nearby. A great and pleasant experience especially to kids."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The place is great. There's a lot of stores here where you can buy strawberries, vegetables and souvenirs! We're not able to try strawberry picking because there's not much strawberries yet."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,nothing to note about the farm itself maybe because its not strawberry harvest season. i suggest you visit the place early in the morning for strawberry picking. food in small carenderias are a must. cheap bargains and wide variety of souvenir items.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Strictly speaking, naming it Strawberry Farm is rather discouraging to other plants, flowers and vegetables planted together with the more famous strawberries. The traffic is horrible when you go there during peak season and in peak hours. Finding your ride among the multitude of parked vehicles is as tricky as finding the ripest and reddest among strawberries. Do not go there during rainy season, the earthen paths are already muddy, wet and slippery when we went last February. There are also many shops for souvenirs."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The place is huge and amazing,  though since its rainy season.  We weren't able to get close to the plants.  Anyway there are lot's of souvenirs around the area that will make your visit worthy. Suggestion,  try visiting at summer season for its Strawberry peak season and the soil is dry."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"I really love visiting the farm. It is kindly peace and has a fresh,surely cold air. The best time to visit strawberry farm is in the morning and on the months of Dec. To February because there are a lot of strawberries may pick. Expect mud when there and even after the day it rains. But if you are eager to go ,you may. Strawberry ice cream is available there also. Other vegetables are affordable outside the farm and there are also stores of Pasalubong but it is cheaper in Public Market."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"We went here in the morning which is great because the farm's not that crowded yet. Good thing we're wearing closed shoes, it was muddy and slippery so i've just opted to buy strawberry on the way out instead of picking them by myself. The charge was P450 pesos for 1 kilo which is expensive, but you get to enjoy and experience picking them on your own. I just got mine for P200 a kilo, all clean and ready to eat! I prefer it this way rather than making a mess of my shoes! 😉"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The Strawberry Farm is a collection of various farms of strawberries & vegetables (like brocolli, lettuce and kale). Just take note of the strawberry harvest season (Nov. - May) to be able to experience harvesting strawberries.Around the farms, fresh strawberries and vegetables are sold. Plenty of small shops are selling souvenirs (shirts, key chains and fridge magnets) and pasalubongs like jams. There are also some eateries nearby. The strawberry ice cream is a must-try!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Beautiful and majestic. Great food at the cafe. Lots of gift shops and cool stuff. The strawberry farm also sells broccoli and lettuce and kale and other produce. Super fresh and healthy and awesome :)
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Although I was not able to have strawberry picking due to bad weather, still the farm is so wide and there are varieties of pasalubong stores which sells very cheap items. I also tried their famois strawberry ice cream and it was so delicious. Truly a very delectable and memorable experience."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"If you want to see fields of strawberries, lettuces, etc., then this is the place for you. There are also many pasalubong shops at the entrance. Strawberry picking is about 500pesos for a kilo of strawberries, i think - not reliable info."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The strawberry farm is very nice. The field is so wide with a lot of different kinds of plants. Its not only strawberries that are on the fields but also vegetables like lettuce, cabbages, etc. that you can pick fresh and just pay the farmer for a very cheap price. At the sides near the parking lot, there's a lot of souvenir shops selling baguio products ( like t -shirts, keychains, hats, etc.) and there their organic strawberry icecream too."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Go here during strawberry season 'cause all you'll see if not are lettuce fields (not that it's bad thing). There are some strawberries sold in souvenir stores and a lot of strawberry ice cream and taho sellers.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"If you go there to pick your own strawberries just to pay double the price that you will at the various tindahan at the parking lot, you might want to ask why.  A strawberry is a strawberry.  Why would I pay the farm owner to pick my own?  In other ""pick your own"" places I've been, it is a small entrance fee, then pay the same price per weight as the store on premises."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"They sell garden-fresh lettuces I have ever seen for only P50 a plastic bag which you can be the one who also picks it out from the plant. I also love the strawberries and blueberries. Just outside the farm you'll see the cheapest souvenirs and delicacies you can buy. Don't wear your heels or prettiest boots you have or else it'll be smudge with some mud. Make sure to go in the morning, just right before the sun blazes you. I really enjoyed eating those lettuces I bought they were literally dirt cheap!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The strawberry farm is located in Barangay Betag of La Trinidad, Benguet and is owned and maintained by the Benguet State University (BSU). The BSU leases at least 500 to 1,000 square meters (5,400 to 10,800 sq ft) lots of the 79.49 hectares (196.4 acres) farm to local farmers for strawberry cultivation.Strawberries are an important part of La Trinidad's economy with the Strawberry Festival held in the town every March.The La Trinidad Strawberry Farm is a destination for tourist visiting the town of La Trinidad. According to the Benguet Tourism Office, the strawberry farm is the most visited tourist destination in the province with 538,346 tourist arrivals for the first quarter of 2017.It is sometimes mistaken to be situated in neighboring Baguio with local vendors selling souvenir and products bearing the name ""Baguio"" within the vicinity of the farm. This led the municipal government of La Trinidad to come up with a Tourism Code in 2018 encouraging the explicit promotion of ""La Trinidad"" name."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Strawberry farm is a place full of beautiful sceneries and vast plantation of meticulously grown strawberries. there are also stalls and mini shops that sells a vast array of products and souvenirs such as jams, wines, keychains and more. a must visit place indeed."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The place is so cold! Well, you need to expect that the place will be cold as it is located in Benguet. A lot of stores can be found in the area. If you plan of picking your own strawberries, there is a fee. Lot of stores offers you all the things you can bug in Baguio but I would suggest going to Minesview or on the Public Market of Baguio as they offer much cheaper goods."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"During our recent visit to Baguio, we also visited this place. This is a plantation not only of various varieties of strawberries but also that of different types of vegetables, spices and fruits. Their produce here are very fresh and healthy, typical of that of the produce coming from Benguet and Baguio. First timers will not only be amazed of how the crops are grown and taken care of, they will also experience harvesting strawberry, of course for a fee, and eat ripe fruit directly from the plants."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"I agree with other guides' opinions. Don't expect too much. I bought strawberries a worker harvested right before near the farm. After i looked around the street stores, i found out that i was stupid. The quality of my strawberries was worse than the one displayed on the any store although mine was more expensive. Don't be cheated. Check the price first."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Dont visit when it just rained or rainy season... The place is muddy you need to wear boots to pickup the strawberry. The Sagada orange being sold in the parking are a lot better than in baguio public market.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"If you want to experience how to pick strawberries and other vegetables then it is the place to go.  There also lots of souvenir shops and restaurants/food tents where they serve foods with strawberries in it. Must try the sinigang na bagnet in strawberry! The sweet berry flavor is so in contrast with the sour-savoury soup of the sinigang,  its a play of flavors."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Choice of buying fresh strawberries from the many stalls or exeperience strawberry picking for P500 (per pax).  Worth the experience but watch out for the mud.  You get to fill your small pail with strawberries.  Don't forget to taste the strawberry ice cream!  Stalls also sell fresh vegetables, strawberry wine, and jams."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Fresh and delicious strawberries and other fresh fruits are available here, as well as souvenir items such as T-shirts, key chains, native handicrafts etc. are being sold here on a very affordable price."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,The iconic Strawberry farm of old has been transformed into a highly commercial and tourist-y place. The wide fields of strawberry plantation has been halved by parking spots and souvenir stalls. Good place to visit if you have ample time in Baguio. It's a drive out of the city and with the traffic it's almost not worth it. Be sure to visit when it's strawberry season otherwise stick to the usual tourist locations near the city.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"We did not pick strawberries because you need to pick and buy it with minimum of PHP 500, but you can enter just to take picture at the entrance  and also there are lots of garden they farm not just strawberries."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,One of the must go while you're in Baguio and in Benguet. You get to pick fresh vegetables straight from the farm and of course Strawberries😍 It's also a nice way to help the local farmers
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,unfortunately we didnt got to expereince the strawberry picking since its not season yet when we get there but it was still a great experience for kids to see how real strawbery and lettuce are planted.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Yes, it’s expensive but we had an enjoyable time. We paid 450 pesos for the privilege of picking a kilo of strawberries that normally sells at 150 pesos at fruit stores. At least we walked away feeling that our carefully selected berries were fresh and will survive longer.The owners of our host farm were friendly and helpful. We heeded their advice to not wash the fragile berries until we are ready to eat them because the moisture will attract molds. To maintain the freshness of the berries, we were also told to wrap them in dry newspaper and refrain from refrigerating them until they reach the lowlands. All these paid off as the berries survived for three days without problems."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,We weren't able to pick strawberries as we just went there 2nd week of November. Not its season. But you can still buy strawberries and other crops from the stores along. Just be sure to negotiate the price if you want to buy kilos of it.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Good activity to do in Baguio. The strawberry picking is a nice experience. You may also buy LOTS of fresh veggies just outside the farm.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Kinda sad that when we went there (August 5, 2018), there were no more strawberries. It was already harvested.On the jeepney terminal near T. Bonifacio, take a jeep that is bound for La Trinidad. Yes, jeep. Cause going there, the traffic is very congested, and taxi would cost you around 300-400.The place has many souvenir shops (as what's common in all Baguio tourist spots).Strawberry-related foods are also available."

You can also take pictures with their native dress and try to take a picture with the horse. They also added now an orchidarium where plants can be purchased, they also sell strawberry plants in here. The farm has a wide area of parking space and if you are getting hungry, there are some turo-turo inside and outside the farm. Try also their strawberry ice cream. Inexpensive but delicious! 😊 Don't forget to visit this wonderful place in La Trinidad, Benguet!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Very nice place to do recreational activities. You can enjoy by picking strawberries and by visiting the farm seeing different kinds of plants aside from strawberries,  you can also see different vegetables."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The strawberries are starting to ripen,  probably by January or February the owners will allow tourists to start picking/harvesting their own to buy..."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Bring an umbrella or hat. We brought kids with us so they can see where the strawberries were being harvested. Unfortunately, the place is muddy. We were being charged P500/kilo for strawberry picking (que horror). Told our kids to pick lettuce instead lol (P50/4 heads of lettuce).Personally, the farm wasn't very spectacular BUT outside, the vendors sell the BEST STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM I have tasted in my entire life (no exaggerations)! A cup costs P30, a cone is P35. It was so delicious I wanted to cry. We bought strawberry ice cream from the PETMALU guy. See photos below."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Good touristy thing to do while in Baguio. We picked our own strawberries (Php500/kilo) and broccoli (Php50/piece). You can also buy cherry tomatoes and lettuce.There are also several stores where you can buy souvenirs from - look for the lady there that sells an organic green rice snack 👍
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"This was my first time in Strawberry Farm  & I enjoyed it. Thw best was the ice ctream which was only P75. Its a one stop shop fir pasalubongs like pnut brittle , strawberry , ube jam , walis , souvenirs, mango jam, plants etc ...we packed our van & had a great time ! Highly Recommended !!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Experienced the strawberry picking ""harvest""so much fun!Here a lot of shops for any kind of jam and of course the best seller is strawberry jam haha..love this place"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Definitely a fresh sight and experience to pick fruits/vegetables straight from the farm. It's free to enter the farm but the strawberries are expensive. Just as expensive in a supermarket, minimum of 1kg for 500php.I don't mind it being pricey, it's just that there's nothing else in the area. You pick strawberries for 30mins and that's it."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"My daughter and I love our strawberry experience here, Picking strawberries is a real experience for my daughter. From Baguio we rode a jeepney going to La trinidad Benguet just tell the jeepney driver to drop you in strawberry farm. We went there in the afternoon so its not really warm but cool and foggy. There are are vegetables and flowers there but of course we are more interested in picking a real strawberry. And the strawberry ice cream? Oh sooo yummy !"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"A place definitely not to be missed when you were in the summer capital of the Philippines.Strawberry Ice cream, strawberry taho and the fresh picked strawberries are the best😍Fresh air is also one of the reasons why I keep on coming back😍#gbgisabela #gbglocalguide #nortebloggers #gerlieletopenbook"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Nearly 30 minutes away from Baguio City Proper is La Trinidad Valley whose main attraction is its vast strawberry farms, making it the strawberry capital of the Philippines.Its floor elevation is 1,300 meters above sea level which explains the cold temperature in the valley, perfect for growing strawberries all year long. 💕"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Take a basket and pick your favorite fresh strawberries right in front of you. A lot of strawberry-flavored delicacies are waiting like ice-cream, jam, fruit candy and more."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Amazing experience!Yes, the strawberries cost more when you do the picking (P400-450), but you are actually paying for the experience.. and the entire family loved it.There's also other choices for picking aside from strawberries, like lettuce, and spring onions.I strongly suggest that you go early in the morning to avoid the crowd, because the farmers only allow one group at a time.After picking, shop at the surrounding vendors/stalls for more strawberries and veggies, which of course is sold at a much cheaper cost.Their Strawberry icecream is a must-try too!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Cool place. There are a lot of vendors that sell similar things, produce, jam, strawberries, candy, amd souvenirs. It is likely best to just buy your strawberries from vendors as they are cheaper than picking on your own. Plus the area where you pick them isn't really scenic it is more of an outdoors greenhouse."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"A farm within the town of La Trinidad, Benguet. Accessible by Taxi or by Jeep. When we visited the farm, there were no Strawberry because of the past typhoon (but there were lettuce and we make the most of it). For your preference, it is better to ask the lokals if it is Strawberry season. In front of the farm are some stores for „pasalubong“, I think they sell cheaper than the stores in Baguio. There are vendors that sell Strawberry ice cream and taho within the vicinity."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The entrance is free ,has a lot of pasalubong or gift shops for less and the strawberry ice cream taste really good but bit expensive, imagine one serving of local street ice cream worth 30 pesos.  The farm is really well taken cared."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"A nice place to visit during ""ber"" months coz its cold weather of baguio, ideal place to go with the whole family during summer seasons, dont go there when festival season if you just want to relax, coz every day during festival month of flower festival every roads of baguio are busy nd crowded.

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,This is very popular when you come to Baguio. Though it is not located mainly in the City('cuase this is in La Trinidad) still you have to visit. Sad thing we were not able to pick strawberries because of the rainy season('cause its August☺).
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"So much joy in picking strawberries with my daughter!...The best time to go strawberry picking in La Trinidad is during the first quarter of the year, most especially during the summer month of March. Just like in any other trip, it is best experienced with family or with a group of friends- important people in one’s lives to share the happy memories with...❤️"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Best time to go. Around 5pm just before sunset. The farmers close early.Try the strawberry ice cream and Taho. Thee best I've tasted.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,I like the Farm and love strawberry jam and wine
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Strawberry picking cost to high.You might buy at the local market to get the strawberry even cheaper.The place is huge and cold.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"I was underwhelmed when I visitied this place a couple of weeks ago. To be honest, I knew that this was an overrated destination but I went with my friends anyway. When I arrived, I was disappointed to see how unkempt the area looks like. Also, I thought I'll be able to pick my own produce but I wasn't able to. Hopefully, they'll be able to turn things around soon kasi the area has really great potential. The only reason why I'm giving this 3 stars is bexause libre yung entrance fee and I hope they keep it that way for the good of the public. But in case they decided to charge a small fee for those entering the farm, I won't mind it either. As long as it's for the improvement of the whole farm and for the welfare of its workers, I won't mind paying an entrance fee."

When I was there I don't know where to start picking, I felt that the strawberries are winking at me, and asking to be picked. It is really a great experience. It is a must try destination."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"We arrived near lunch during the Christmas peak season. It was hot and most of the gardens were either closed or had no more strawberries to pick. Good place to buy pasalubong, strawberries or other fresh garden produce. Try the strawberry dirty icecream or strawberry taho, just for the sake of it."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"This is my first time to put one star. You should not come to this place except for Saturday. Firstly, you cannot pick up any strawberries except for Saturday. Secondly no one tells it until you go far for muddy road. Your feet will get muddy. everywhere muddy, Thirdly, there is feet wash business. You can clean your feet only after paying P15 ( FYI CR is only P5)"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Not just a Strawberry farm! This farm also have cabbage, lettuce and sunflowers which they sell for about ""3 for ₱100"". Though strawberry picking is priced at ₱400 per kilo (note that minimum is 1kilo). All in all, the place is a must visit so you could experience being in the field surrounded by vegetables and fruits and flowers."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,I was disappointed for not being able to take a tour at the farm itself. There are no other way inside except the isle covered with mud. We were not able to pass and just opted to buy pasalubong at the stalls outside the farm.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"This place is a good spot for tourist to buy pasalubongs, it's like a one stop shop. Stalls also sell fresh vegetables, strawberry wine, and jams."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Date of visit : Aug 25, 2019Always refreshing to visit this place and leave the busy city life for awhile. Its a big nice place wherein you will pick by yourself the strawberries or lettuce that you will buy. There's a lot of stalls outside selling souvenirs, preserves, fresh fruits and veggies. You just have to walk around to find the one selling the lowest price (they are all selling the same items). Do not forget to apply sunscreen or wear hats  to protect your skin from direct sunlight."

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Several small vendor stalls and strawberry picking.  We went on a rainy day, so it was less than great.  Being from the US, strawberry picking is not exactly a rare experience.  Don't let my review deter you from visiting.  I sincerely hope your visit will create fantastic family memories."

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Beautiful strawberry farm, you can pick and pay for it the fresh fruits. It's really sweet!"

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Nice place.   Don't expect too much here.  it is a bit overrated.   Try not to go during peak season.   So over crowed and traffic is worse than Manila.During peak season this city and attractions are completely over whelmed with super traffic.  It becomes a grid lock. To enjoy this city avoid peak times especially around xmas and new year.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Going there can be a bit of a challenge because the roads to and from the farm is narrow, underdeveloped, and is usually full of tourists. Though, it is still one of the best places to buy fresh vegetables and fruits for your ""pasalubong"". You can also go down into the farm and personally pick strawberries."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"You can buy lots of pasalubongs here. Variety of plants and vegetables. Oh btw, farm has sunflowers🌻 too."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"For the past 5 years, I've been visiting Baguio at least once a year. And I make sure that I could visit the strawberry farm. Its the best place to buy strawberry coz it's cheaper. You can also experience picking the fruit, and if you are planning to do so. I suggest that go to the back part of the farm, theres more options there and the chance that you can pick good size of strawberries."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The area is surrounded with stalls to buy  This is the place where you need to buy veggies and pasalubong. It is cheaper here than the market of Baguio plus strawberries are fresh. I did not like the taste of the carinderia nearby. Expensive, oily, not tasty food."

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The only area you can witness in Benguet where in the sky and the flat lands kiss. The place is quite stinky in some areas maybe because of the fertilizers, but not on the parking area wherein some foods are being sold. You should never miss eating their tasty and hot Bulalo for only 25 pesos ($0.50). Or you may opt to eat their strawberry ice cream for the same price. Avocado flavor is also an option."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Known by many as the BEST place to get the freshest strawberries, the Strawberry Farm in La Trinidad is also the best place to pick your own strawberries in their farm! It is a must-do when visiting! Not only that, the strawberry farm is definitely no stranger to ice cream lovers. There are a lot of ice cream carts with very friendly “manongs” who are more than willing to give free samples of their amazing strawberry ice cream! (I had to give myself two servings of it because it’s so good!) Lastly, while you’re here, make sure to get some fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as “pasalubong” (souvenir) snacks/items here. Your Baguio trip will never be complete if you don’t go here! 😋"

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,It's a good place to go... Lot's of people and small shops for souvenirs to buy. We're just unlucky because we didn't get to do the strawberry 🍓 picking . There's no ripen 🍓 yet. And also it would be nicer if there's a benches with a shade to sit down when your tired or just want to chill for a moment and a small place for children to gather and get to know with other kids to standby while the adults are busy with other stuff. Of course with safety and security.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,The Best place to find Pasalubongs and Gifts in cheaper cost! I love also the Strawberry Icecream in sorbetes and the pure Philippine Made Strawberries!The Best experience Ever!!!

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Excellent farm with lots of vegetable varieties and of course strawberries!
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Wow,.! I had a great amazing experience harvesting strawberry, its so hot yet im did enjoy. 🍓🍓👍👍👍"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Nice view. You can pick fresh fruits but you need to pay for it. Overall, great place to visit."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Everything you need for your pasalubong is here. Not just strawberries and vegetables.  Strawberry price is on the high side but so is quality vs. Baguio public market. Go for the stall right in front of the farm. They have the freshest bunch. Letucce, brocolli, sagada oranges is as fresh and inexpensive as it can be. A definite must. Peanut brittle and sweet jams are a hit or miss. Stick with Good Shepherd and Baguio public market instead. Bring plenty of cash and reserve space at the back of your car for your pasalubong. You might regret it later"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Nice place to buy and eat strawberries with some native foods and accessories
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Locals were nice enough to give us a “free taste” of their famous strawberries. We bought a lot, of course. 😁"

The sun is shining brightly that day when we visit strawberry farm but oh the chilly breeze is just so perfect, I feel delighted with my handful pasalubong.😊"

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,You can't really go to the farm and touch the plants. It's more of going there to see them from afar.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Great weather in December and various fruits to buy in the Farm ❤
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,They said January to April is the best time to visit to see plenty of strawberries.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,You can harvest and pick strawberries yourselves. Friendly and helpful strawberry growers are onsite.

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Great and wonderful place perfect walktrip ,perfect food and great souveneirs ,and perfect views of the farm"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"""You did not go to Baguio-Benguet if you did not go to La Trinidad Benguet's Strawberry Farm?"". That's a simple way for me to say about this tourist destination. I have a lot of workmates and friends from low places and I cannot remember any of them visiting Baguio-Benguet whom I did not bring to Strawberry farm. I do not know exactly what to say why I would recommend this place but it is just definitely an icon. You can buy relatively cheap local products and souvenirs here or simply pick fresh strawberries. There are great improvements of the farm through the years as well, like wide parking space with minimal fee, better road and better stalls. Being in the place, you can just see and feel how simple the people are in Benguet regardless of their status."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Nice place,sorrounded by stores that sell souvenirs."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The strawberries in this farm is so delectable and fresh! It will always be fresh and pleasant to our eyes, but hold your horses!The price is not that right. The famous Benguet Strawberries grew more expensive as years pass by. It could be due to the changing climate in La Trinidad that affects these sensitive fruits, as well as the fertilizers and pesticides that they should apply from time to time.During our 2016 vacation, strawberries cost P400/kilo and it will be painstakingly bad for your purse if you picked too much from that farm, only to find out that it will only take 2-3 days for each berries to keep their quality, especially if you have no refrigeration in your home.Don't worry! Here's the good news, there are a lot of strawberry vendors outside who sell processed goods to keep your strawberries last longer than how it should be. Strawberry and Ube Jams are largely sold here, as well as other native handicrafts such as knitted hats, bonnets, coin purses, keychains, brooms, printed shirts, wooden toys, and many more.Prices continue to soar high, but if you are a wise traveler, you won't see yourself bargaining with the vendors for a long time, just for them to give you better favors, instead, go out, roam around, and see the best prices for yourself!PS. Strawberry farms doesn't only grow strawberries alone. It is a vast cultivating land where cabbages, tomatoes, sunflowers, brocollis, and other vegetables are perfectly grown and sent to different restaurants for their dishes."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Great place with lots of souvenir shops. Must try foods are strawberry taho, strawberry ice cream and avocado ice cream"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Pick fresh strawberry and lettuce of your choice.. Do not wear white shoes :)
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Many stores. You can buy vegetables, jams, street food. I highly recommend trying strawberry ice cream and strawberry taho."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,We had good fun picking our own strawberries here. The sad thing is its cheaper to buy the strawberries right outside the farm than it is to pick them. Anyway it is an interesting fun place. Other strawberry products such as wine and jam are on sale either in the farm or directly outside. It took us about 30 minutes to drive there from the centre of Baguio
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Well mentained place and it's clean. People are kind and humble
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Good place for picking fresh strawberries and other fruits.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The place is nice . there's lots of strawberries inside the farm . But strawberry picking is more expensive than buying it to the sellers . But if you wanted to experience it, it's fine but for budget wise - better to buy outside the farm. The strawberries tasted the same as if it's freshly picked.."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Strawberry picking Php450 per kiloCabbage Php65 per kilo
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Although we weren't able to pick fresh strawberries during our visit on November, it has been a good experience to drop by here because souvenir stalls were beyond incomparable. Items like shirts, sweets and the arrays of different fruits and vegetables were at competitive price. Diners can also feel a sense of satisfaction for it offers diverse dishes best served with smile from the server🍓  🥕🍇🥞"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,The place is very beautiful. There are lots of variety of strawberry that you can enjoy and eat.

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Must try the taho and icecream wiyh strawberry flavor.. We wanted to try strawberry picking, unfortunately it was so muddy and slippery we cannot go in. 😌"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"It has been highly commercialized now. But I suggest that you get your walis pasalubong here, much cheaper than in downtown market."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"My most favorite part of our tour was the strawberry picking. We can only do this in Baguio, so yeah I really enjoyed it a lot. One of my dreams come true!!  To save money, ask someone to split the price. LOL The best thing was that they will offer a free taste of their different ice cream flavors.. I love the avocado flavor!!!  I am looking forward to creating more memories and visit the beautiful places in the PH ❤"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"You can buy and experience to pick or harvest fresh strawberries here. You can also buy many handicrafts/souveneirs made from our raw materials. People here are so respectful, hospitable, and can satisfy your needs 😍."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,You pay to pick the strawberries and then you pay per kilo for what you gathered. It's cheaper to buy already picked strawberries lol
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"we bought fresh strawberries, grapes and sagada orange. it is now clean, spacious and sectioned unlike before."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"lovely  place  , great views  of  mountains and  cloud  coming close  with  stretching farm land  consisting of  Strawberries  lettuce and  seasonal  fruits.You can pick , collect  and  buy  them. love  this  place  . They  have  plenty of  vendors outside  near the  parking selling different stuffs and  souvenir."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,I just wish this place gets more tourist guide to promote agriculture instead of the direct selling type of tourism.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Very restful. It was fun to see rows and columns of strawberries as they grow, side by side with lots of lettuce, in another plot."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,I am so happy that I got the chance to visit Strawberry Farm in Baguio it is so cool and very nice farm.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Mahal strawberry picking @ 500php per kilo. 😅 Better bumi n alang sa labas. 😋😋😋

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Fell the Breeze and enjoy the beautiful view of strawberry farm taste the strawberry icecream and other products
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Awesome experience of picking your own strawberries. Php400 per kilo is really worth it!
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Went here with friends.  Though I have been living in Baguio for quite some time now, I've only visited the strawberry farm recently.  It is a good experience for kids so they know how their food is grown.  However, it gets too crowded and because of the many people picking strawberries, you won't get to experience it yourself because by the time you get your turn, all the strawberries have been picked already.  They don't charge a fee to enter.  You can buy fresh veggies at minimum prices.  You can also harvest lettuce if strawberries are not available. Accessible by jeep or cab. Best to visit with kids."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Not season for picking..just bought products on site...
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Though the place is nice, the locals tend to say that people should visit during the summer since that's the strawberries' fruiting season. Mostly looks like vegetables when it isn't. Vendors sell goods at a low price and the people there are very accomodating."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Picking is enjoyable but not really recommended to go when the sun is at its peak, better to go strawberry picking in the morning. The price is 500 per kilo. We asked the staff if we could have extra strawberries added in our basket for free and they said yes. They have welcoming personalty and will assist you at first but then will leave you on your own in order for you to enjoy strawberry picking all by yourself. There are souvenir shops (a lot) and food stalls. There is no entrance fee so you can just go directly inside the farm whether you'll be picking or just look around the farm."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"We enjoy the adventure of walking inside the farm. If you like to have the feel of harvesting and actually touching different types of lettuce and strawberries while enjoying watching native rice cake and native ice cream, this place is fun and adventure."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"It was a nice place to visit. I didn't know that strawberry picking is only allowed on Saturdays. When we went there last weekend, all of the strawberries have been harvested. We will need to wait for a few more months before we visit the place for a strawberry-picking experience."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Fresh Strawberries! 🍓🍓🍓 Love the sceneries.   
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The people were nice and accommodating, but the price was kind of well, pricey, hehe. Although I think I can understand why, plus you get to try as many strawberries as you can before weighing in your final harvest. Also, they sell a variety of locally made delicacies there like jams, preserves, wines, and more."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"When you are visiting Baguio, please include in your itenerary a visit to the Strawberry Farm. The Place is nice. Weather is good. And you will enjoy picking strawberry when you are there. It is a little difficult for PWDs particularly those with wheel chairs. Prices of their produce are very much affordable. Great place if you love strawberries and vegetables."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Strawberry picking is so fun, you get to pick the sweetest and perfectly ripe strawberries. Not so big though. The only downside is the farm is so touristry specially during weekends, and traffic is a total chaos. Open between October to May."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Great place for strawberry picking.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"I went here with my friends last year, a week before my birthday. Even though we didn't get to harvest strawberries, it was still worthwhile looking at the beauty of the vast fields as well as seeing how hardworking the people of Benguet are. Hope next time we visit I'll get to experience harvesting strawberries!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,A place where you can pick strawberry and a lot souvenir stores nearby
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Very nice place, alot of different things to see and buy"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,The area is full of souvenir shops which is a lot cheaper and also if you were lucky enough ypu can see fog where it meets at the land.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"It just rained when we got there so there was mud all over. They were selling plastic bags outside that you can use to wear over your shoes so that they won't get dirty. Was a bit hot after the rain on an April morning. There were a few farms that were not accessible, while some were just selling lettuce.  Strawberries were small that time. Still a great experience especially if you have kids."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,The strawberries are still sweet despite of its off season
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Get ready to have dirt/mud on your shoes. You get to pick the strawberries yourself but it costs more as compared to those readily available on the stores. Nice experience though esp for the kids.It is advisable to visit this place early in the morning to experience a pleasant temperature and avoid traffic and dense crowds. Stores around the area offer bulk prices that you can still negotiate: vegetables, strawberries, other pasalubong items, mementos, souvenirs."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"it was already 6pm when we arrived at the farm. strawberry ice cream tastes good, will definitely buy again when i come back. there are lots of souvenir shops selling their goods with cheap prices (unlike in banaue, costly paninda)."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Family fun activity whilst in Baguio. Strawberries for picking are available depending on the farm. Prices are negotiable, i.e. pay by the kilo. No entry fees. There's a market across the road from the farm which sells fresh produce.Try everything: strawberry ice cream, strawberry taho, strawberry cookies, strawberry jam, strawberry cake...."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"About an hour's taxi ride from Baguio City, the entire plantation is leased by Benguet State University to strawberry and vegetable farmers at 500 sq meters for each plot. Strawberries for sale at P100/kg but the experience of picking strawberries and putting them in your basket regardless of how many you are in a group for P450/kg is a delightful experience. We went there at high noon but the air was cool."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"There is no strawberry picking last week when we visited you can see lots of lettuce in the farm., we were advised that strabwerry picking will be available this coming december. Even though there is no strawberry planted yet you can buy at the sidewalk. We bought strawberry for 180 pesos per kilo :)"

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Strawberry picking may be costly (450php for picking a kilo) but you get what you pay for. The strawberries are much sweeter when picked during its ripeness, compared to what can be bought in the stalls since strawberries there were handpicked way before they become ripe."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Great place to visit. Shops had a variety of items to choose from.  Walking distance to great food. Friendly and helpful staff.  I would highly suggest coming and visiting the strawberry farms.  Worth the drive!  Jeepney was friendly as well! 10/10 would come again

Strawberries by products are plenty like jam, vinegar, candies and juice. Why not try delicious strawberry icecream its only here."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Main spot to visit when in La Trinidad, Benguet. You can pick fresh strawberries, or simply buy them from vendors all around the area, try the strawberry ice cream from vendors on bikes, buy fresh vegetables, souveniers, etc.. Paid parking doesn't have any shade and the gravel could use a little more work. Prepare your sunglasses and sunny gear when you visit. Comfort rooms aren't too accessible here."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Highly recommended if you want to experience how to pick vegetables and strawberries. Along the area you can buy some souvenirs. You can also buy some ornamental plants some stalls offer around the parking lot area
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"An interesting market with every seller selling the same things. The sale goes to the best pitch and price. The winner for me made us feel like family. Try this and taste that, don't leave empty handed."

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,I love strawberry farm.its nice and beautiful farm.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"When you want to buy strawberries, try harvesting your own. It was my first time to harvest strawberries. It was a really great experience. You have to pay per kilo for the strawberries you picked. I forgot how much it is."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The first place we visit when we went to Baguio is the strawberry, i thought it's hard to look for the place. You can ride a jeep going La Trinidad and tell the driver to get you off to strawberry farm. When we get off to the farm it was still fogging. It's very wonderful place. Yet if you want to pick a strawberry of your own that would be expensive unlike if you just buy in the market."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Twice we've been here - Sept 2016 and Nov 2018. Both times no strawberry picking. We were told in 2016 to come between November and May.  This time they had to replant the strawberries due to recent typhoons.  We were able to buy some strawberries  and wine though.  In 2016, there were no comfort rooms and had to pay at a nearby store to use theirs. Now,  we saw there were comfort rooms but they were locked. Vendors selling taho and ice cream will flock to your vehicle as soon as you've parked.  Some were very persistent. Lots of souvenir shops at cheaper prices compared to the City Center."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"This is one of my favorite place😍If you are looking for instagramable photos and at the same time looking for fun activity, you can enjoy picking strawberries😊😊 It was fun and memorable trip.

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,first time to picked strawberries . but I think the price was quite expensive for 1kg .
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"It was better back then. Now it's just a tourist trap with low quality pasalubongs. The roads, and parking spaces ruined the experience since you now have to stay at the side of the road and watch out for vehicles while shopping. As for the view, there isn't much to see besides the hills around the place. Still a good place for baguio souvenirs though."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Its very cool in this place. LOTS of food to eat and also has a very great view to picture. The only exception is that when it rains or after it rains its very hard to pass through that muddle way to the strawberry picking. Anyways, great place!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"I’m a local of this farm, wakes up to its majestic foggy morning and basks in its sunsets. Every morn, our senior street sweepers would scour the area keeping it clean, and the garbage trucks too come on time to collect our properly segregated waste. As much as you appreciate the farm, PLEASE let’s us all try not to scatter or nonchalantly throw our plastic wastes and recyclables anywhere. Let’s leave the place better than we first saw it, or at least leave it clean. Enjoy the cool weather everyone! Welcome to Strawberry Farm!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"You can pick your own strawberries for 450 pesos per kilogram. If you do not like to pick them by yourself, there are a number of stores selling fresh strawberries, as well as vegetables, wines, and souvenir items."

For free unlimited picture taking, go further into the fields.3. Be early. By 10am, there will be too many people and it will be a bit difficult to find someone to assist in strawberry picking."

Delighted to see elevated  strawberry plots similar to Malaysia strawberry farm I visited 5 years àgo bringing plant resiliency

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Strawberry products abound here as it is the main source of strawberries in Benguet. Apart from strawberry products like jam and wine, there are products made from other fruits and vegetables as well as fresh fruits and vegetables.

The area however gets muddy when it rains and could get to be so crowded during the peak season."

The road getting there was also amazing!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Cheap vegetables and strawberry
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,We came here to pick strawberries but the place has more lettuce than strawberry. Very disappointing. And no one at the front to warn you about it so you'll waste 1 hour or so walking looking for strawberries.  Plus the shops outside selling foods are very expensive.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,A bit crowded and traffic. Needs improvement as waters flowing on the sidewalks are smelly.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"There are lots of stalls that sell fruits, veggies, tshirts, keychains and the usual pasalubongs.  If you want to go strawberry picking,  please bear in mind that stawberries are seasonal.  Stawberry taho and ice creams are always  available though.  Parking is a challenge so better get there early or just get a Grab taxi.  There is pay parking just before the stawberry farms but it gets muddy when it rains."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Ok here's the deal. This is a tourist trap so be prepared for throngs of people with selfie sticks making their way through the farm. Despite the crowd, we did enjoy picking strawberries from designated farms but we had to pay more than 50% if just bought it packed also from the same farm. Definitely a one time experience."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Pick your frsh strawberries for P480 per kilo.Expensive yes but this is to cover for the crop damage that could be encountered due to untrained hands and kids.Fresh veggies are also available at a very cheap price
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,So beautiful place

I was very pleased."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Few strawberry to pick. More Letuce picking stuff. Go in the morning and if you have contact near to the place, better ask if strawberry were ready for picking otherwise, you will just buy strawberry ice cream or just pick Lettuce or Brocoli. You can fly drone but ask first."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"We came at a non-busy time so we thought the visit would be more terrific than what we came to see. Honestly, I was quite dissappointed that not all farms were operating at the time.... nonethless, buying the strawberry and avocado icecream afterwards sealed the deal... i hope more improvements will be considered by farm owners in the future."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"One born every minute, Suckers....this reminds me of Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer - paint my fence look at how much fun it is... pay twice the price for strawberry's you pick. must be a bunch if city folks who never been to a farm. the place was polluted had garbage all over the place the irrigation stream flowing by looked like a cesspool, surprised the people eating the strawberry's aren't going to the hospital with botulism. the trip from the city to the strawberry farm took 1 hour to travel 7km. in all seriousness the place is a tourist trap not good buys. a complete waist of time."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Wish we came at the peak season of strawberry picking. But then again, the crowd would probably be a little difficult. Nevertheless, it was a fun experience and a good family/friends bonding."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Also dubbed by visitors as Strawberry fields, is less than an hour's drive away from Baguio City proper. I've been here twice. It was fun walking through the patches of greens, with a mix of flowers in different colors. Vines crawl up and down the trellises sticking through the ground, from left to right, up ahead to the farthest expanse of the farm fields. Grab the chance to buy from the farners themselves for the freshest produce of lettuce, cabbages, cucumbers, cauliflowers, etc., and the famous Baguio strawberries. Prices vary, though. Handpicked strawberries are pricier than the ones packaged and displayed at the gates. There are also a number of stalls around the area where different souvenir items are sold. You can also treat yourself to yummy strawberry ice cream and/ or taho."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"A somewhat ""commercialized"" farm.

It's really cool to see the vegetables in their gardens."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Baguio's famed strawberries farm has a great view of the field. Can be crowded at times. Too many shops that blocks the view. Only great during harvest season. Unpaved.

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Bought the picked strawberries for 100pesos. Way cheaper than picking it yourself which cost around 400-500. But you'll love the experience. So nice.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The strawberry farm has different owners but in an Association in order to distribute the pickers evenly. The ones near the gate got crowded when we were there. They didn't welcome us but it was a blessing in disguise because it made us go further and ask for another owner to welcome us for picking. Thanks God, we were welcomed by the brother of the owner who were there and he was so generous. He gave us the strawberry for 500php per kilo only unlike the others who asked for 600php per kilo. He also became our photographer as we were very busy picking the strawberries. It was like, we owned his strawberry lot. Haha. I told him I'd really recommend his strawberry farm lot because he warmly accommodated us. Salamat ""migo""! Cheers to more strawberry with you and your sister. By the way, the name of his and his sisters farm is, Berries and Green Tower Garden. Highly recommended."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Caveat! Sellers of fresh strawberry in kiosk are shrewd. They replaced your fresh strawberry with rotten one once they packed it in plastic sando. Check your items before you leave... :-(
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Fresh Strawberries!!! Price differs depending on the season. The must visit place at Baguio City! From Burnham Park, La Trinidad Benguet Jeepney Bays are located at the back of Mini Rizal Park. If you cant see the jeepney bays, you may ask everyone around.

Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"I was so excited to see the place, since lot of blogs, reviews and hyped tv ad about the area saying that the place is good so on and so forth.. Upon arrival, to our dismay, there are no strawberries for us to pick, no berries at all.. As a suggestion, i guess it will be better to allow the berries to have a break.. And have a specific season for the tourist to come, visit and enjoy the strawberry picking process.."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"All in all a good experience. The concept is very simple, you get a chance to pluck your own strawberry, weigh it, pay the price and eat them.Its just a 30 mins ride from camp john hay where we had stayed (The Manor). My kid throughly enjoyed plucking it, but could not enjoy eating the strawberries as it was aĺl spoilt by the time we reached back home. Apart from strawberries the market has wide verity of vegetables which are much fresh as compared to what you get at Manila supermarkets. I loved strawberries icecream which is available at 20pesos each.This place is a quick halt while returning from baugio. Go there you will enjoy it."

Lion’s Head,"One of iconic tourist spots of Baguio that you shouldn't miss.During pandemic, it is recommended to strike a deal with your taxi driver to go to and fro here, coz the passing public vehicles are limited.It is not crowded during pandemic compared to before."
Lion’s Head,This is always a worthy stop-over. Everyone should pay homage to this post-modern structure for a bathroom break or a taste of that home-made strawberry ice-cream or to just take a snap of the big lion which i do all the time.
Lion’s Head,"It is quite far from the city. And as of August 2022 (during our visit) limited people are allowed in the area since the Kennon is no longer used as way going down to Manila.We were the only tourist during our visit, so you do not have to wait that long to take photos"
Lion’s Head,"The Lion'S Head:One of the most iconic tourist attraction in Baguio that you shouldn't miss! It's along Kennon Road and it's a landmark when entering Baguio City! It's free for all so have fun taking a selfie or groupies with the the beautiful sculpture made of limestone.👉 PS: You may watch, like, comment and SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel 😘"" Arlene Aces """
Lion’s Head,This is a marker thst tells you that you are now entering baguio city. Enjoy take some pictures and have some fun. Just make sure to clean up your mess once you start again. Better yet just tale many pictures as you can. Make as many momories as you can. And leave nothing but foot print no trash.
Lion’s Head,Good experience. We're lucky that Kennon road already opened after the earthquake incident this July 2022. None much are affected in Baguio.
Lion’s Head,Perfect time to visit around 2pm weekdays not that much of people taking photos …More
Lion’s Head,If you want picturesque views and historical settings in Benguet... this is one of them 💕
Lion’s Head,You can find out that you are fairly close to the summer capital of the Philippines at this location.Lion's Head is better to be visited on Normal Days and you should have your own car or service
Lion’s Head,One of the iconic and most visited tourist spots in Baguio. One can say that you should visit this place when you go to Baguio.There were a lot of people when we visited. There were also taho and ice cream vendors.
Lion’s Head,20- 25 mins away from Session Road going to Kennon Road by car.Leave your ID at the checkpoint (if there is one) as sometimes Kennon Road is closed and can be used by residents only. …More
Lion’s Head,"Very underwhelming experience, the queue is very long and very crowded. It looks good in pictures and hearsays, but looks very disappointing in person …More"
Lion’s Head,This is a 40ft limestone sculpture by a Cordilleran artist commissioned by the Baguio Lions Club (a civic organization of the wealthy) during the dark era of martial law. It's a giant club ad and it's become a landmark since then. Although I think a lion doesn't fit in the Philippine context. But this is a cute stop along Kennon Road. Kids would love this. The views beside the lion showcase the mountain ranges. There's a parking lot for 10 or more vehicles beside the Lion's head. Not much to do here except take pictures and go. You can also support the local vendors by purchasing pasalubong.
Lion’s Head,"Be aware of your surroundings! Many cars are passing, parking or pulling out, but it's a fun place to take a photo😅 …More"
Lion’s Head,"Passed here dawn before daylightSouvenirs available in the areaParking along the roadTaho strawberry, of course, is available"
Lion’s Head,Baguio's forever favorite icon. Always crowded. Still a good place to drop by going to Baguio. …More
Lion’s Head,Beautiful view but the road is under construction. Date 06/24/22
Lion’s Head,Lion' Head was somewhat creepy on the its left side when facing it at night. I think they need to put on lights around the statue to look more formal and not intimidating.
Lion’s Head,Waaaayyy better landmark for Baguio than... someone's head... 😂😂
Lion’s Head,The number of souvenir stalls around the monument has mushroomed in recent years. …More
Lion’s Head,i just wanted to congratulate the lgu and the man behind this idea of turning a simple rock into something more...a giant lion head 🤟
Lion’s Head,"It was amazing, and so cold that your kness can wiggle wiggle. …More"
Lion’s Head,A place where you can buy souvenirs and take some photos while stopping by on your travel way up to baguio city …More
Lion’s Head,Super ganda BOOK NOW Highly recommended @Lakbay Tourismo Travel and Tours …More
Lion’s Head,"Crowdy, but the place is still nice. Proof that you went to Kenon road. …More"
Lion’s Head,tourists spot that is just a few kilometers away from my place.
Lion’s Head,Strawberry is a must try! It was so hot in this area but we managed to take pictures. Overall nice experience!
Lion’s Head,"This is one of the landmarks that you will know you are near Baguio City. Located in Camp 6, this landmark signifies the presence of the Lion’s Club International in the City. This can be reached (when you’re coming from Baguio) within 30 minutes. There are also several pasalubong / souvenir stalls in its vicinity."
Lion’s Head,The view is nice and when we got there there a no to few people. The activity you can only do there is have a picture taken and buy some strawberry taho before going to the city.
Lion’s Head,A famous landmark going to Baguio City. …More
Lion’s Head,Baguio experience will not be complete without having a picture with the Lion😎
Lion’s Head,"Too crowded, just need to find a spot on the opposite side of the road. But enjoyed the ube flavored taho from local vendors. …More"
Lion’s Head,"Well the place is very beautiful, I fact the journey down the hill from top of the mountain until this point is beautiful. Due to landslide ahead we could not go beyond this point. Very clean and very good people around, try to click pictures in Baguio traditional dress just next to the lions head"
Lion’s Head,"Crowded and noisy but awesome to visit for souvenirs. Just a warning though you should be here early because of the traffic parked vehicles are causing and oh this place is a tourist trap, just take a photo of the big Lion's Head and head on your way."
Lion’s Head,nice 👍 . been wanting to see this ever since.
Lion’s Head,One of the most iconic landmark of Baguio is the Lion's Head. Best to visit on your way up to Baguio by driving through the scenic Kennon Road.
Lion’s Head,This spot is one of the most tourist attractions that definitely make it to your bucket list.
Lion’s Head,This iconic landmark of Baguio seems to be in disrepair when we went there. A little repainting job could make it look better.
Lion’s Head,"Livelier than ever before with snack vendors (taho, ice cream) and souvenir shops. Traffic enforcers are also helpful with parking."
Lion’s Head,"One of the most famous landmark here in Baguio, madaming turista lalo na kapag hapon. Its good see that they well maintained the head, around the area you can enjoy the strawberry taho and strawberry dirty ice cream."
Lion’s Head,There is already a parking space now just beside the statue which is very helpful
Lion’s Head,"Great, iconic monument unlike the ravaged statue of the evil plunderer/ “mega magnanakaw” on the other longer road to Baguio."
Lion’s Head,Baguio with Friends🙌🏻😌 thank you abby for driving us here😄 buti nalang. Heheh
Lion’s Head,"When we arrived at the kennon road triage, this was the first landmark we dropped by. There are lots of seller selling strawberry flavored taho. It's really good, you can also ask them to take your picture. ❤️"
Lion’s Head,"Nice view, you can picture the awesomeness of lions head structure."
Lion’s Head,"Lion's Head is a popular tourist destination along Kennon Road going to Baguio. I rated 3 stars because I am of the opinion that it has lost somehow the prestige because of the too many tourist footprints. Nevertheless, it is still one of the tourist spots in Baguio, Benguet Province."
Lion’s Head,Great and nice place
Lion’s Head,"Kenon road is ""somewhat"" always closed but if you asked nicely, you'd be able to go. Lion is neat and newly painted. There were few people and almost had the place for ourselves. Less tourists while there's the nCoV scare. A viewing deck is being constructed nearby. I suggest coming here during summer. There's a need to deal with a huge crowd though."
Lion’s Head,Nice place for stopover before going to city proper via Kennon Road.Make sure your car is in good condition before going to this place.
Lion’s Head,Experience the beuatiful place in the Philippines. The summer capital. …More
Lion’s Head,"Typical statue in honor of the lions club family. But the view makes it astonishing. Too bad, mining on baguio caused the landslide that could be seen on this area."
Lion’s Head,A little crowded with everyone who wants to take a photo of the Lion's head
Lion’s Head,"Many cyclists come to take pictures here, its such a wonderful place worth to ride"
Lion’s Head,The place is good even at night. There are less people.
Lion’s Head,"Another well-known landmark associated with Baguio is the Lion's Head. It is situated in the slopes of Kennon Road. This is one spot that's also popular with tourists so we've decided to head on to Manila early in the morning to avoid the crowd eager to take selfies/groufies with this famed structure. Parking could be an issue. Just an observation, the head didn't look as nice as it was in the old days. It changed a lot through the years, funnylooking lion esp. with it's color. So artificial."
Lion’s Head,"It makes me happy I finally have pictures taken from here. Although there was a paint signage that blocks the nice view in the left side of the Lion's Head, so far it was nice."
Lion’s Head,If your lucky enough when you pass by the head there's few people you cant get your photo beside it. Unfortunately when we passed its already late and there a lot of people there so i took this way far away (so that our car wont block the road since there are plenty of cars already parked near the vicinity). …More
Lion’s Head,The Experience was great. It's just that the prices was too expensive their compared to the city. …More
Lion’s Head,An amazing placeBaguio history
Lion’s Head,One the landmarks you'll see when you're getting near at Baguio. With stalls of pasalubongs and souvenirs in the area.
Lion’s Head,"A tourist spot icon along the popular Kennon Road welcoming the visitors of Baguio City. Nothing really in here, you just have to stop for a short picture taking and that's it!"
Lion’s Head,"As always, Baguio trip will not be complete without seeing this big Lions Head. Now newly repainted and maintained and of course with shops of the sides. Compliments to the government of Baguio as they secure it with cops and it shows they have prides and taking care on their tourist spots as well as the tourists."
Lion’s Head,A baguio must visit place...
Lion’s Head,"10 minutes finished all.beside road, only make photos. But there's some male CR really can give you surprise,if you try you will be know. And beside lions head have a tree growing on the stone, it is amazing."
Lion’s Head,Davies paint signage ruined/photobomb the view. It is usually crowded especially by the vans/cars of the tourists which causes traffic. But still its a nice place to see.
Lion’s Head,"Such a beautiful place, fresh air, many people are taking photos of Lion's head."
Lion’s Head,Iconic place for those who would want to have proof they have gone to Baguio. The place offers scenic parking space and lots of souvenir items. Nothing much to do here but it is a must to take pictures if you pass through Kennon Road.
Lion’s Head,"Good to be back here, lions head seems newly painted, sadly unable to capture the lions head itself due to my faulty camera, anyways the view is nice"
Lion’s Head,"beautiful scenery, i really like the place"
Lion’s Head,"he origin of Baguio’s lion head is as colorful as the history of the road where it currently stands.When the Americans conquered the Cordillera highland in the 1900s, they had a hard time reaching the Benguet mountains. Establishing a short route to these mountains would greatly boost the local economy, so the American government soon launched an expensive road project, much to the dismay of politicians in Washington D.C"
Lion’s Head,"Very exciting to go there,that was my big dream came through ever. …More"
Lion’s Head,Just passed by this spot en route going home from Baguio. Novelty items and trinkets sold by various hawkers. There’s a public toilet available. Native Igorots are also available for souvenir photos. You might want to don a traditional costume and sit with them for a selfie. Kinda crowded on a Sunday afternoon. This will always remain a famous landmark for Baguio visitors.
Lion’s Head,Painting nicely done! And the view?! Lol sorry its already late but the view was great in the morning. Best stop after the long ride in kennon road.
Lion’s Head,One of the structures that signifies your are near Baguio
Lion’s Head,"Be a tourist in your own town,Welcome to Baguio City,City of Pines."
Lion’s Head,Amazing stone sculpture that stands in the rocky Highway of Benguet. …More
Lion’s Head,"Situated in a place located before entering Baguio City, the Lion's Head is a major tourist destination when visiting the City of Pines via Kennon Road. It is a gigantic concrete head of a lion made by the Lion's Club and it sorts of greets and welcomes all visitors who wishes to enter Baguio not only to escape the heat and stress from the big cities but also to experience the nice and cool weather and honest and friendly people that Bagiuo offers."
Lion’s Head,4:30am to 5:00am Monday morning …More
Lion’s Head,"The iconic Lion's head conceptualized by the Lions Club members of Baguio, is a must see spot. The new painting done by Baguio local artists (I assume) makes the Lion shows its boldness. It might get a little traffic around the area due to its popularity, few parking space is available, but worth seeing it fresh. You might get lucky on a weekday if few visitors would be around."
Lion’s Head,Very nice cooling weather at about just below 30°C being the highest. Don't even need an air conditioner at night to sleep.
Lion’s Head,"Well they said Lion Head welcomes you in Bagio, it was a nice place to take photo. Lion Head means your about to enter Bagio. Souveniers are available, Taho and Sorbetes ice cream strawberry flavored are available to. Carefull of magic snatchers, when parking your car makes sure its lock or leave someone to guard it. :)"
Lion’s Head,The lion sculpture is OK. Parking space are not organised. Too crowded not only by tourist but also by stalls/vendors
Lion’s Head,"Iconic Lion's Head that tells you youre in Baguio already coming from Kennon Road.Hope they open Kennon soon so we don't have to ply Marcos Hiway with those big trucks.Coming from the town proper, there's a checkpoint in fromt of the Kennon Viewpoint, you have to leave your License so they can guarantee that you will come back up and not pass by Kennon to Manila.Not a lot of people coming here these days compared before. Good thing they repainted the Lion, without make up like before!"
Lion’s Head,Nice location for viewing.People are organized.
Lion’s Head,"Quick stop, not much to do but surely you can get your strawberry taho/ice cream and pasalubongs here ☺️"
Lion’s Head,Historic Monument Indeed
Lion’s Head,Lion's Head is amazing! It makes every traveler's Baguio escapade complete.
Lion’s Head,You can see it even from afar still look the same. Nothing much to see or do …More
Lion’s Head,Wide road for quick stopover for picture taking.
Lion’s Head,Nice scenic view behind the lions head. But the lion's head itself is old. Nothing special. It's way from the city is dangerous. Make sure your car works perfectly specially the brakes. But the view is worth it. Got few shops with toilet alongside this tourist spot.
Lion’s Head,"It's nice to see in a personal view,"

Lion’s Head,Landmark along Kennan Road leading up to Baguio. It looked more beautiful before the local government gave it a paint over.
Lion’s Head,"Amazing sculpture carved from the original rock. Lots of small stalls of souvenirs,very cheap."
Lion’s Head,I'm verry happy cause its my first time there and to see the beauty of Baguio and also Benguet but sadly it is pandemic so i didn't try to see the other places there b'cause of restriction..
Lion’s Head,People going to Bagio will not miss this huge Landmark located in Kenon Road
Lion’s Head,Looks good now. Less tourists in the afternoon.
Lion’s Head,"Childhood memories... it may be the oldest iconic landmark when baguio come into mind, do spend a bit of your time to take snap or two"
Lion’s Head,Nice scenery. We stopped here for a photo on the way back to Manila.
Lion’s Head,Great tourist spot for Baguio. Although I would love to see it back when it was naturally stone without the paint.
Lion’s Head,"Good souvenir for the times.. if going to Baguio, remember to stop by this monument"
Lion’s Head,"Its along the road where ypu can passed it if ypu are going on a private car. Its cute, its like your first stop in baguio. Enjoy"
Lion’s Head,It's been awhile since I last saw the big Lion guarding the place. Felt nostalgic. Great  tourist attraction!
Lion’s Head,Good tourist spot with overlooking view. Locals are friendly and helpful in taking photos and memories.
Lion’s Head,The famous Lion Head are already repainted and there's added attraction beside that the tourist can enjoy
Lion’s Head,Evade this place during the holidays. Crowded and you can't get a good photo with the huge lion statue anyway.
Lion’s Head,"Lot of souvenir shops arround, crowded place to take lion head pic"
Lion’s Head,First stop via Kennon Road.
Lion’s Head,Still one of the best tourist spots.

Lion’s Head,Nostalgic feeling. Been here 41 years ago☺️
Lion’s Head,best stop over from kennon road going to baguio
Lion’s Head,Snapping a picture in the iconic Lion's Head is a must when going to Baguio. The paint job during our December 2021 trip was the best by far.
Lion’s Head,Landmark on the way to Baguio.Now colored yellow instead of black in the 70s and 80s.
Lion’s Head,"Five stars cause why not, nice view, free, it's a bit boring and cliche though"

Lion’s Head,"Unfortunately,Lion's head is under constraction on my first time visit during that day. ( so sad ) There is so much bamboo' surrounding the Lion's head."
Lion’s Head,Huge lions head so very cool to take a photo
Lion’s Head,First time to be here.
Lion’s Head,Nice place but the ads of Davies Paint should be reduced. It does not look good on the picture
Lion’s Head,"Great view to stop over, a little preview of the River Bued. If you're a tourist coming up yo Baguio via Kennon, do stop and admire the view."
Lion’s Head,Too many people to enjoy the place.
Lion’s Head,The place is in a major road going in and out of the city. Those who want to take picture with it must be extra careful in crossing tne road to have a better view. And limited parking spaces. So if you there already many cars parked better to schedule your visit during dead hours when tourist are usually hanging out somewhere else..  :)
Lion’s Head,Very impressive work of art
Lion’s Head,Manila inbound due to iatf friday saturday until 12n..outbound baguio during sunday 12n to 12n monday..

Lion’s Head,One of the beautiful spot in Baguio City were people take pictures as a remembrance in this place
Lion’s Head,Wow Leon Head Baguio City.
Lion’s Head,I stopped because..... Well because there was a huge lion head on the side of a mountain.  It was an interesting stop.
Lion’s Head,Lions head the prime landmark of Baguio
Lion’s Head,"The lion's head will look better without the souvenir shops near it. . .the stores should be relocated to the proper area but not adjacent to the lion's head.further, the lion's head should be repainted black, its original color. . .shops cause traffic near the area"
Lion’s Head,"there are souvenir shops around so if you are passing there, don't miss it"
Lion’s Head,It's an interesting stop on your way to Baguio.
Lion’s Head,A staple tourist spot for new Baguio tourists.
Lion’s Head,The view of the head is not that amazing as you think. A lot of local tourists take turn in taking photos.
Lion’s Head,"It's very popular and eye catching, but at the end of the day is not artistic, there is no particular view to enjoy and is very commercial: plenty of stalls selling any kind of cheap souvenirs. But yes : it's instagrammable 😊"
Lion’s Head,Nice view and stop over.
Lion’s Head,How ironic people living from nearby don't have any selfie moment's with this historic statue LOL
Lion’s Head,"Baguio is one of the most beautiful and one of the coldest places in the Philippines, and one of them boasts the lion head of Baguio, and it is my favorite to visit because here you can see the beauty that Baguio has. The scenery is very cool in this area, and it is common for our countrymen to try too nice experience."
Lion’s Head,"This is a ""head-turning"" Lion Head sculpture along the road to Baguio City. The sculpture itself is a great work of art. Many people stop here for a while to take photos, have their snack, go to the CR and buy something for themselves and for their loved ones. Well, not so impressive but it adds some excitement as you travel going up to the city."
Lion’s Head,Nothing much to see here... Quite a landmark tough...
Lion’s Head,Nice View
Lion’s Head,A great place to take photos but you'll encounter a lot of issue as you enter the area. It's along the road so be careful and watch your kids. Hard to get back to Baguio through commuting. Preferred to have a car to drive back to Baguio.
Lion’s Head,amazing stone works one of the attraction goin to Baguio City
Lion’s Head,"Great carving on a rock completed in 1972Lions clubs internationalThe Kennon Road Lion's head was the idea of the Baguio City Host Lions Club, a service organization that has its members volunteering for various humanitarian projects worldwide."
Lion’s Head,Kenon road is close but lions head is still accessible for picture taking... you'll just have to ask permission from checkpoint personnel.
Lion’s Head,"When you travle to baguio thru kenon road, you can see it."
Lion’s Head,Nice view. Lion's Head.
Lion’s Head,The City as a whole (Baguio) is generally cool. The view and everything. This lion head is a little bit far from the city. This should be the last place you visit if your next destination is Manila. The place is great.
Lion’s Head,a must see when you visit Baguio. this is one of the landmarks of Baguio that has attracted numbers of local tourists since it was put up. it is now newly painted and looks more like a lion than just a randomly painted fixture along Kenon road.
Lion’s Head,Iconic landmark before arriving at the city of pines.  A great & popular place to get a photo souvenir.
Lion’s Head,👍
Lion’s Head,"The place is great! Local shops for souvenirs and strawberries are  available. Can also take pictures on the Lion's head, St. Bernard dogs, and you wearing Igorot costume/attire."
Lion’s Head,Ganda here. You should visit too. …More
Lion’s Head,Fun time to take a photo of the lion head. Parking was very limited
Lion’s Head,Nice place to take a picture …More
Lion’s Head,Going up!
Lion’s Head,Very nice view
Lion’s Head,"Not only boring, but the Davies' paint company that must've painted the monument at no cost put up a giant sign literally bumping up to the head, littering it's appearance, making it impossible to get a photo without the sign in it. It's unbelievable that they allowed such a devastation to that monument."
Lion’s Head,Nice!
Lion’s Head,you must visit this place in kenon road.
Lion’s Head,The view is so nice to take pictures
Lion’s Head,I went pass that lion's head when i went to Baguio City.Its a nice town to visit provided that you need more warm jackets.Remember its usually cold high up in the mountain. Sometimes from 10 degrees down to 7 degrees..
Lion’s Head,This is a very historic attraction. We dropped off to this place before leaving Baguio however Kennon Road was closed for safety purposes. If Kennon road isn't passable people will have second thoughts to go there because it's quite far from the city proper.Tourists should visit the Lions Head even it's far from the city. The view is on the way there is so amazing!
Lion’s Head,"Near the end of the scenic Kennon Road is a famous sculpture of a lion's head. Parking is rather difficult to find due to the narrow road and sloping terrain. There are comfort rooms (15 pesos per use) and shops nearby. Since the best shots are taken right in the middle of the road, do be careful when taking pictures."
Lion’s Head,Stop get a photo. Everybody does it. Cross it out of your list. Get it done.
Lion’s Head,You weren't in Baguio if you had not passed by this popular monument here. Lots of stores selling all kinds of stuff which are usually the products of Baguio can be seen along the sides. Including these 2 St BernRd dogs. So cute and friendly- php20.00 if you would like to take a pic with them. LOL!
Lion’s Head,one of the many structures not to be missed when u are in baguio.
Lion’s Head,Very little parking. A good photo op place with vendors as well. Be prepared to donate 5 pesos to use the comfort room (restroom).
Lion’s Head,Quite dangerous to park if going down from Baguio so we need to be careful how we get off the car and get photos here. Usually very crowded too. Some taho vendors are nice. They share the people buying from them if buying in group (like we were). They are also nice enough take our photos. Even when initially we were not going to buy taho from them.
Lion’s Head,Your first stop going to Baguio.
Lion’s Head,high five!! having fun in here..
Lion’s Head,Wonderful places in baguio city
Lion’s Head,Ilove this iconic place in baguio.this is the real proof that you visited the summer capital of the country.
Lion’s Head,An iconic statue along Kennon road that keeps visitors curious for a stop before heading up to Baguio city. It has been repainted several times
Lion’s Head,"It's one of the city's most popular landmark with a new look. Thanks to the city local artist who braved the heat to bring a new vibe to this landmark. Complete ur baguio experience  by taking  kennon rd  on your next trip to baguio, for u not to miss out a  picture at the Lions Head."
Lion’s Head,"First time experience at baguio, its great..."
Lion’s Head,Newly painted/renovated Lion Head
Lion’s Head,Nice place to picture …More
Lion’s Head,Nothing much to showcase. It's so hard to get a cab from there. We had to take a jeep for 23 sitting capacity and dropped us in Baguio plaza.
Lion’s Head,I wouldn’t specifically go here to check out the lion’s head. Nothing much to see anyway. It is a good short stopover tho if your way to Baguio is from Kenon Rd. Limited parking lots and it is a cause of traffic most of the time.
Lion’s Head,"This landmark has been an icon in Baguio City. Once you've reached this part of Kenon Road, this means you're very near. Brace yourself for the heavy traffic. Lots of tourists want to take a picture of this great lion and visiting Baguio City is not complete if you haven't taken a selfie or a grouphie with the lion."
Lion’s Head,"Davies Paint sponsored its paint, but shouldn't shamelessly photobomb the landmark. The makeshift souvenir shops contribute to the messy scene. Tourists compete with traffic just so they can look for a good vantage point for picture-taking. Why not mark the best spots?"
Lion’s Head,"Go there if you have a private vehicle with you. It's easy to go there when you commute by jeep,  but very difficult to commute going back to the city as the jeeps passing there are usually full."
Lion’s Head,This place is so memorable...
Lion’s Head,Nice view
Lion’s Head,Nice place to visit
Lion’s Head,"Awesome statue, restored around 1974. Great picture taking opportunity especially in the mountainous terrains surrounding it.Local roadside shops selling souvenirs, snacks and beverages."
Lion’s Head,The place is under renovation right now so I was kind of disappointed when we went there.
Lion’s Head,"Lion's head is a welcome tourist spot before entering the mean city of Baguio.People also at this place is very responsible greatful,helpful to all tourist.Also,In this place people are very strict specially in improper disposal of garbage. So we tourist must also have a disipline to avoid penalty."
Lion’s Head,Souvenirs and baguio stuffs available here.
Lion’s Head,its nice to be back!
Lion’s Head,Great place for a stop over. There are souvenirs which offers much cheaper price than the one in the city. This used to have ifugao dancing before but there is none now.
Lion’s Head,It's a sculpture of a lions head located on the old winding rood to Baguio - it is big yes but so what?It's just like so many other landmarks - if you have taken your picture get on with your life.
Lion’s Head,beautiful as always
Lion’s Head,A great stop
Lion’s Head,"This is a ""welcome"" landmark to the city of Baguio.  It's at kennon road.   When you take a Baguio city tour this attraction is always on the list of photo opportunity must-haves.  Be careful.  Kennon is very narrow.  If driving, wait for the traffic personnel to guide you to your approved parking slot.  Busy at most times of the day except evening when standing on street can become dangerous."
Lion’s Head,Bring bck old memories
Lion’s Head,They say you've never been to Baguio if you haven't visited this place. A big rock shaped lion along Kennon road. A lot of stores surrounding the area selling souvenirs.
Lion’s Head,"It is suppose to be a 5 but recently the lion's head ave become the 'make-up artists dummy', their practice site. The head looks funny and not that mighty and king of the jungle-ish kind of thing. However, that doesn't mean that it doesn't deserve to be visited cause it's still a great place and worth visiting for."
Lion’s Head,🤓😎✔️
Lion’s Head,"If you take a taxi going here, ask if it could stay a while. Take a picture then go back. If your taxi can't wait, ride a jeep going down, it will come back up. Jeeps going up are usually full."
Lion’s Head,A very crowded place. Tourists should go up straight to the city because there's more to see aside from the lion's head and being the cause of traffic.
Lion’s Head,Nice place
Lion’s Head,its nice to have the addition of the St Bernard for kids to meet this type of breed.  and they dont have to go far to see the Katutubo dress as well as take pictures with Lion's head with family.
Lion’s Head,i think it is still on-going beautification during our visit. and also kennon road is closed.. so accessibility and iterinary/planning is a little off.
Lion’s Head,"Due to bridge construction going up to Kennon Road, traffic is terrible."
Lion’s Head,"First attraction to see in Baguio if you will be coming from Kennon Road. Parking is free alongside the road. There will be people assisting you while you park so better give them a tip. ""Strawberry taho (soya) - 30php"" and ""strawberry sorbetes (ice cream) - 25php++"" is available here as well."
Lion’s Head,This is the place you'll never forget to visit before exploring the city.
Lion’s Head,Only good for causing traffic jam and accidents.
Lion’s Head,"This place is where you can see a lion's head which is made up by rocks, is a very beautiful creature that made it more famous. It is one of a tourist spots in benguet wgere you can take a lot of pictures with it"
Lion’s Head,Great View! …More

Lion’s Head,Only in baguio …More
Lion’s Head,Very nice
Lion’s Head,the view… is awesome:) and yes. This Lion’s head is something that “screams” Baguio.. 😊
Lion’s Head,"The Lions Head is a statue along Kennon Road, measuring 40 feet in height,  conceptualized by the Lions Club members of Baguio in 1972, Worth visting located  on major  highway to  the  city of  baguio.Nice  to take  pictures  and  spend  some  time."
Lion’s Head,Fun for pictures and souvenirs
Lion’s Head,"I've passed by there once...Just passed, didn't stop, eh what's the point of the lion guys, I've asked many  but I always get the same answer, ""to take your picture and go"" lol, not when was it built, why?, by whom? What is it's purpose, also the the lion looks dumb as hell especially the colour choice, I mean, it's a lion, or should be.something a bit more regal than having a dumb look on its face with a shoddy paint job eh? My opinion  and yes it doesn't matter lol"
Lion’s Head,"The Lion Head is an iconic landmark leading to Baguio City. However, it is located in an accident-prone part of an accident-prone highway. I wouldn't recommend stopping by to take pictures in this park as you have the risk of being run-over by cars traversing the highway."
Lion’s Head,One of the must see landmarks in benguet along Kenon road..
Lion’s Head,I'm glad it's clean and doesn't smell bad
Lion’s Head,It's a landmark that you shouldn't miss when going to Baguio. I been there 3x but the 3rd one makes it complete having a photo-op witht the Lion Head.
Lion’s Head,great experience here lions head attraction 🙂
Lion’s Head,"If you haven't taken a photo with this before, then go ahead. But it's too crowded and how it was repainted makes it look gaudy. The shops that sprouted in the area adds up to the bad traffic"
Lion’s Head,Lion's head. ❤️
Lion’s Head,You're never in Baguio if you weren't able to visit this landmark.
Lion’s Head,A little bit of traffic build-up but the experience was worth it! Good for photo-ops for one of Baguio's famed landmark.
Lion’s Head,Nice nice nice   🏼
Lion’s Head,After lots of lockdown touch down again
Lion’s Head,The place was awesome! Quite dangerous for its on the side of the road but there are police officers to ensure traffic and public safety.

Lion’s Head,Fresh Air!
Lion’s Head,Iconic landmark telling you that you are very close to the Baguio city proper. Very hard to park during peak season.
Lion’s Head,15 minute stop before touchdown to Baguio City.  This iconic landmark is a must if going and leaving Baguio.
Lion’s Head,My Beautiful Baguio city wonderful place... great weather. Summer capital of the Philippines.
Lion’s Head,"For that last minute pasalubong needs before leaving the Cordillera regions, the Lion Park is here for you. There are comfort rooms available in this area. Already missing the strawberry-flavored taho? There's a friendly taho vendor here who will volunteer to take your group picture without any obligation to buy from him."

Lion’s Head,"Currently being renovated, a good stopover before going in to Baguio. Iconic and picturesque. Overrated souvenir shoppes though."
Lion’s Head,Good place to relax
Lion’s Head,Lion head got painted. Also sidewalk shop became rampant. Taking a photo accross the road requires bravery and luck to get that group photo with the lion head.
Lion’s Head,Its a nice stop to check out when you're on you're way up or down the mountain.  Some really cheap shops on the side to to get food and drinks!

Lion’s Head,The lion's head is big. Hehe. The experience here is ok. The twists and turns on the road are just annoying and the security is a bit strict because of covid 19. But overall satisfied. He is ok.
Lion’s Head,it took a long time before we got up.. hopefully next time we can go up from rosario because last time we didn't get down so we went back to marcos highway
Lion’s Head,It's nice to look at him from the side because you can see his back connected to the rock. We have pictures as group friends with the side of Lions head. She’s better than you don yourself to the Head. Why? Not so many people. So you also have an option and that's your side at Lions Head 😊About free parking only.
Lion’s Head,It's worth the experience manila to baguio with a motorized honda click 125 the weather is still nice..😍😍
Lion’s Head,Be careful when crossing because there are many passing cars along the high road.There is a gift shop on the side. Child's Bonnet is P100. The Strawberry Taho is P50.
Lion’s Head,Nice place to see.. it's just difficult to park because sometimes there is traffic..
Lion’s Head,"We just came here to take pictures. If you are going to visit, maybe go on weekdays because there are a lot of people on weekends"
Lion’s Head,It's worth it even if it's far. 😍❤ it should be included in your itinerary.
Lion’s Head,"This is a rock that originally looked like a lying lion. Later, when I was deliberately discovered, I processed the head of the lion to look more like a lying lion. Now it has become a scenic spot to enter Baguio. By the side of the road, when you see it, you are very close to Baguio City."
Lion’s Head,Unique icon in Baguio City
Lion’s Head,"Really good looking view. it relieves fatigue when climbing, the flight is worth it. maybe visiting again when not busy 👌❤️"

Lion’s Head,"Before entering Baguio, we actually go to this because we really like the scenery on Kenon road unlike the Marcos highway,,"
Lion’s Head,"It's my 2nd time climbing Baguio, but this is the only climb that I really can't forget because I'm with my husband.☺️"
Lion’s Head,"Sold me a strawberry that said it was sweet but when I tasted it it was too sour .. even if the strawberry was still ripe, it was harvested as long as it could be sold ..."
Lion’s Head,You know you're from NASA Baguio when you first see the lion's head. I just wish it would return its old color because it was more beautiful. 😊✌️
Lion’s Head,"Unless you have a special reason, it will not appeal to those coming from Turkey. There are many similar places in Turkey, but a cool environment awaits you for those who are overwhelmed by the heat."
Lion’s Head,"The lion's head is on the main road connecting Baguio to Manila, Los Angeles and Sobek, a few kilometers from Baguio, beside excellent booths sold by many traditional industries."
Lion’s Head,"A huge lion head, right on the street. Since there is no big detour, you are welcome to stop and take a picture. But nothing more."
Lion’s Head,Some parts of the lion needs to be fixed. But still one of the best to be in the baguio! Not full baguio experience if not here! 😊😊😊

Lion’s Head,"I'm really new to Baguio, but Lion Head is a must-see !! The scenery was so pretty and so nice! I really recommend"
Lion’s Head,"Do not go when the rainy season, aside from the road is dangerous and you will not even enjoy scenery"
Lion’s Head,You should stop and take a picture on the way. Well done
Lion’s Head,It's also nice to visit. Last time I saw this in person was when I was still a kid. For sure will come back if Kennon Road is ever really open to the public
Lion’s Head,"It is on the way to Baguio. Although it was the first tourist attraction of this trip due to traveling by rental car, it is currently evaluated that the original potential is halved due to the remake."
Lion’s Head,It's nice but the thing is you can really solo the lion's head. Always a lot of people.
Lion’s Head,even though the rain is still in the head lions. keep safe on kennon road ..
Lion’s Head,It's nice to walk here in the morning.

Lion’s Head,"I stopped by while touring at Vulcan 650.It is a place such as a famous place and service area.In addition, facing the Lions Head, Route 54 is a pleasant road with a curvy road condition."
Lion’s Head,I was confused where the Lion's 🦁 Eyes 👀 🙄🙄 was looking
Lion’s Head,The view is offensive to poster painters
Lion’s Head,"he has new paint now, that's all hehehe"
Lion’s Head,It's just hard to take pictures because there are definitely a lot of photobombers. Then there is traffic because there are too many tourists who have stopped 🙄
Lion’s Head,Just calm down. It's hot in Bulacan ..
Lion’s Head,there are also shops here
Lion’s Head,Brother -in -law!

BenCab Museum,"Very nice museum. I enjoyed seeing arts plus a good view of a hill and trees in one of the veranda of the museum. If you're already hungry, you can order a snack at their Cafe Isabel located at the ground floor of the building. …More"
BenCab Museum,Really glad to have finally visited this place. I wouldn't wonder why sir Ben Cabrera is a National Artist. His works are magnificent and his taste on art is impeccable. Really glad the place has expanded so you get to enjoy and appreciate different types and media of art. Totally worth the time and effort. …More
BenCab Museum,"We bought an entrance ticket for 150pesos each. If you are fond of paintings, you can enjoy this place. If you want to eat in the restaurant inside the museum, make sure to bring enough money because 1 meal cost around 200pesos. When I asked the cashier how much is the bottled water, she didn't answer me. That's why I gave 4 stars😅 By the way, the bottled water cost 60pesos each😁"
BenCab Museum,It looks so good inside the museum. Taking videos and pictures with flash is not allowed though.It's also hard to get a taxi/grab there so I recommend that you bring your own car.
BenCab Museum,Must see when in Baguio for those in the art scene. They also have good cafe restaurant. Allocate a full day to tour the place and enjoy the experience the artist has brought to his guests.
BenCab Museum,"Interesting collection. I did really like some of the paintings. The view outside is also beautiful. There is a cafe at the lowest floor, will definitely try it next time."
BenCab Museum,BenCab Museum is a great place especially for art lovers like me. It houses several galleries of different artists and exhibits and a nice place for venue shows.

Overall, it has a nice view and very calmly ❤Entrance Fee? Yes. Php150 per personCafe food price? Ranges from Php100 to Php300"
BenCab Museum,"If you are into art or just want to take artsy or hashtag cultured photos. You must visit Bencab!

You can take a seat on their café and order a food. The food tastes so good!! Actually, no restaurant or cafe failed me in Baguio!"
BenCab Museum,"This place is awesome. The main highlight of my Baguio trip. It features tributes to the work and life of the National Artist Benedicto Cabrera as well as highlights the history of his art. Also displayed are relics from the natives of the area.You can spend hours immersed in it all and afterwards relax and recharge at the cafe and garden at the lower deck. A bit pricey but of course taking it all in with the view makes every bite worth it. Had pares, bulalo, and basil pasta. Will definitely come back the next time we visit Baguio."
BenCab Museum,"Amazing museum on the outskirts of Baguio City. Extensive collection of beautiful cultural artifacts. The view cannot be understated as well. 10/10, would recommend. …More"
BenCab Museum,"A trip to Baguio will never be complete without going to this museum. I get that most of the artwork on display are still the same year-in, year-out, save for a gallery that’s being updated based on who’s exhibiting. But the sheer pull of BenCab himself, as well as the art he made of the place, with the museum building and then the garden and the ponds, and even the cafe, makes a pilgrimage to it worth it every time."
BenCab Museum,"Lovely museum in stunning grounds, definitely worth visiting if you're in Baguio. All of the art on display, by local artists, is excellent and the space itself is very nice. 150 entrance per adult.There is a cafe on the ground floor and a koi pond and seating area outside. The grounds of the property are huge and very beautiful - you can do an eco tour for an extra 150 per person to explore the grounds."
BenCab Museum,Love the curation of Filipino modern art in different mediums. They have other experiences as well; outdoor nipa hut on the lake and the cafe.Would be better if the front desk lady wasn't rude if you don't have smaller bills.. Also much better if they have gcash payment if they can't give you the change right away.
BenCab Museum,Adequate parking. Friendly staff. Php 150 entrance fee. Discounts available for students and senior citizens. Paintings and sculptures from renowned and upcoming artists. There is a cafe with a great view. Must see when in Baguio.
BenCab Museum,Super awesome... One should not miss visit this super amazing museum. Apart from the beautiful amazing materials in the museum... the outdoor of this museum is jaw-dropping          …More
BenCab Museum,Nice place to go to.... Nice pieces on display.... View is good....  Took so much photos with my besties.... The staff members are super helpful if you have questions about the art pieces and also helpful in helping us take nice selfies.       
BenCab Museum,"A go-to place whenever I’m in Baguio. Located at Asin Road. Just took jeepney from terminal near Burnham Park then the jeepney will stop at the Asin Terminal, few minutes walk to BenCab Museum. Entrance fee is around P150 (adult price). A good way to immerse on art and culture of Baguio. There’s a variety of painting and sculptures. At the ground floor, we dine in at Cafe Sabel - overlooking the garden, pond and mountain view."
BenCab Museum,Love the place. The museum and the outdoor. Saw other pieces aside from BenCab. They have a cafe and a souvenir place. Love how they categorically arranged the pieces.
BenCab Museum,This place is very relaxing! Mr. Cabrera have paintings made by Ang Kiukok in his personal collection. Just wow! I love every corner of this museum and I hope I can purchase one of his paintings soon!
BenCab Museum,nice place to visit when in baguio. the property is located outside the busy streets of the city. offers great views and good food of course the paintings and fine arts collections of the owner. could have been better if the place had elevator for seniors and pwd's
BenCab Museum,Great place for art. Has a cafe inside as well plus the koi pond. Saw that there is debit card/credit card option on the store as well. Quite far but the trip is worth it. P25 via jeepney from Burnham Park
BenCab Museum,"a long ride from baguio city proper, but definitely a MUST VISIT. my boyfriend really enjoyed the personalized mini tour i gave him from the bulol, some of the national artists' works and the current contemporary artists i have met and encountered.we also enjoyed a cheesecake and coffee from Cafe Sabel.the view is 💯."
BenCab Museum,The place is so beautiful with all the artworks. A must visit for Baguio City visitora.
BenCab Museum,"Very creative artist BenCab. Various works of Art depicting people's life and culture.  Ohhh I love the pond, the garden and nature around. Must see while in town"
BenCab Museum,Amazing view for picture taking around the edge of the mountain. Lots of beautiful art to look at and ponder. Reasonable price of 150 pesos per person as this review is made. $3.50 CAD. Spent a couple hours there including eating at the Cafe. I had the fish and it was tasty. There's 4 floors included with various art and a little pond with ducks outside.
BenCab Museum,Love this place... The whole place showcases Baguio's heart of art.  We enjoyed our afternoon coffee drinks here. Relaxing views because its far from the city proper.We find a hard time finding transpo going back to the city proper at around 5:30pm. Its not accessible by Grab and only few taxi were passing by. You can ride a jeepney back to the city.This is a must go places in baguio...
BenCab Museum,"We came in during the rainy season,so theres not much people around. The place was nice as expected and theres a lot of scenic areas in the garden for selfies and photos. You can also reach the place thru commute jeepney even if you dont have your own car."
BenCab Museum,"Definitely a must see in Baguio.Sharing some photos, but the real artworks are much more awe inspiring.It’s 4 floors below with a coffee shop at the bottom. If the skies are clear, there’s a scenic view to match the coffee.The tour is arranged so that you get through all the artworks and talk about it after with coffee.There are feature artists from time to time so there’s reason to come back and appreciate new art."
BenCab Museum,Much more than a showcase of the artist's work and his collection of artifacts from the region. It's a sanctuary and nature park that visitors to Baguio should not miss.
BenCab Museum,"The place is amazing, except it's not PWD-friendly. There are no ramps, only stairs. The artworks are lovely! We got to eat in the restaurant and the food is so delicious, but pricey. The view is so relaxing as well …More"
BenCab Museum,Damn what a great collection of paintings. When you think the tour is over your view overlooks a beautiful koi pond garden backed by a mountain wall of trees. The cafe has some pretty awesome eats as well. I highly recommend the strawberry shake. So FRESH! …More
BenCab Museum,Nice collection and awesome view at the mountain with ponds with koi fish and ducks
BenCab Museum,I'm a lover of art so this place is very close to my heart. The place is spacious and very ideal for long-staring contest with the pieces that adorned the walls of the place. I love that it has an outdoor garden as well as a Koi pond.
BenCab Museum,Good place as it is.  Videos and cameras with flash are not allowed. 😁
BenCab Museum,"The place is really a gem. Great contemporary local art and indigenous craft.For art lovers a must visit, some interesting works by Filipino artists covering many different styles.Showcasing beautiful and amazing art pieces. Also, the outdoor landscape is so beautiful..."

BenCab Museum,"Wonderful works of art are displayed all over the museum. If you're planning to bring your kids, you might not enjoy the museum that much. Don't hesitate to avail of the eco trail to maximize your visit. …More"
BenCab Museum,"Location: 🌟🌟🌟 Quite far from the city. We rode a taxi in going here, but I noticed some jeeps will take the passengers directly in front of the museum.Going out of the area is a different story though. When the jeep passes by the museum, it's already full and not many taxis pass by due to the location. We had to walk maybe a kilometer just to look for a taxi that will take us back to the city (I'm not complaining though because we were able to enjoy some carved wood stuff that the neighboring shops sold).Price: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Entrance fee is okay considering it is one of the most beautiful museums I have visited.Museuem itself: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 the way they organized the artworks is what amazes me. From the Igorot artworks to modern artworks, all were so beautiful. It will leave you in awe.The musuem is situated on the mountains and the view is mesmerizing.I will definitely be back with with my family once more.Overall rating: 4.5 out of 5"
BenCab Museum,"Lots of different types of art to look and admire at, with a spectacular nature view."
BenCab Museum,"It's always been a good experience going to Bencab, though it's general admission fee is a bit high. Generally, it's expensive going there since you got to take a cab to and fro the city. It's worth it on a good day, but not on a rainy day. You can't enjoy the garden if you want to.The artworks are awesome, but there's nothing new. I hope there will be more new pieces to see.CafeSabel is nice, except for the prices of food and beverages. But of course, you've got no choice when you're thirsty!"
BenCab Museum,Good for the artsy. Good for the gram! 📷 Good food at Cafe Sabel! A bit pricy but worth it! Try their baby back ribs & volcano ice cream for the dessert. 🍦
BenCab Museum,The museum itself was full of dry modern art. Not a big admirer of art in general but despite even that i was just not inspired at all. The only thing that saves the place is that they have a nice small pond with koi fish and some ducklings in the back area. …More
BenCab Museum,"I will NOT go back again. The customer service ruins my experience with the art museum. The personnelles do not  know how to greet us back. They don't know how to say simple thank you nor welcome and they are annoyed when being approached. Some of the guest are unruly, kids running around like it's a park, people talking too loud and will crowd you when you walk - no staff close by there to maintain the ""museum"" atmosphere. The comfort room is squalid. Knowing that the guests pay here, the floor is muddy and the toilets have no flush. Also, you taking video is not allowed. You may want to check their facebook reviews too. Better go to National Museum in Manila."
BenCab Museum,"Well, this place is a must see spot when you are exploring Baguio specially when you do love artworks. They also have a cafe for a small bite and some refreshers. You may also be amaze with the scenery and calmness of the landscape."
BenCab Museum,"Very interesting museum, it features the rich culture of the Igorot too. A must visit in Baguio🤩"
BenCab Museum,The location of this art museum is quite far from the city but it’s still worth the long drive. Not just for art lovers but also for people who appreciate nature or both. Entrance fees are paid at the reception area. They have several sections of paintings and sculptures showcasing local talents. BenCab has several nice masterpieces in oil and canvas. It has a coffee shop inside the museum. You can also have a guided tour along the trails for those who’re nature lovers. Very nice location for a museum.
BenCab Museum,"This is a must visit place. There are a lot of art works to see. They have different collections - paintings, sculptures, etc. There is also a small resto and their food is delicious and tasty. You can also enjoy the scenic place and take lots of photos except for some restricted areas in the museum."
BenCab Museum,"As a Baguio Resident, I can confidently say that this place is a must if you're visiting Baguio City. Just around 30mins or less from the city center you could enjoy this superb place full of solid beautiful local art and the museum itself gives a world class vibe. It also has a cafe inside, no need to worry if you get hungry specially that you need energy and time to fully explore the area. An eco park is also located inside the premises where in an eco trail tour is also available upon request (tour inside are also available). This place is truly worth the visit, staff are very accommodating too. A gem near Baguio. . . fascinating 👍"
BenCab Museum,Place is nice but crews not so .. …More
BenCab Museum,we go here not only for the artworks but mostly for the coffee shop at the basement of the museum. nice and relaxing view of the garden and ponds. pretty good food selections also.
BenCab Museum,Try the eco trail. PhP 250 …More
BenCab Museum,"I was very impressed and glad to finally visit BenCab Museum!This is definetely a place to go if you are in Baguio.Car park available at the front of the building and also along the road.Once you have paid for your ticket, you will be informed/reminded that pictures are permitted however without flash. No videos allowed. You will also be given a map of the Museum.Toilets facility is available inside the premises.There is also a restaurant/cafeteria where you can enjoy a meal, coffee or simply a snack with a beautiful view. The food and coffee are really good.There is an outside area of which I enclosed some pictures. Is very beautiful and peaceful.Inside there are different sections with a variety of subjects and artworks, I won't post any pictures because I took too many and I don't know which one to chose. I think you should really go and experience it yourself,  is worth it :)Enjoy!Thank you,AMestizaInManila"
BenCab Museum,Galleries are always updated. Its always a new experience everytime I visit.I visited again during the pandemic which was awesome because I got the place (almost) all for myself. I was heartbroken by the time I visited this place because of an unexpected turn of events from an employment opportunity in the city but visiting this place made me forget the worries. Viewing the artworks was soothing.
BenCab Museum,"Aside from the astounding art pieces in the museum, the view on the museum's balconies is amazing. You could also grab lunch at Cafe Sabel in the lower ground floor or take pictures at lake just outside the museum's cafe."
BenCab Museum,The place is far from the city of Baguio but that makes it better since it does not become overcrowded. The location is also idyllic and you could go and relax here.The works and collection of our national artist is really interesting. There are tours and the tour guides are very accommodating and will answer your questions.They also have a cafe and the food is good. They have an ecopark which comes with a minimal fee.Restrooms are clean as well.
BenCab Museum,"This is a really great place with beautiful art. First of all, I appreciated the fact that the place is accessible via public transport. I find Bencab Museum to be similar to Pinto Art Museum and I think I've spotted a few artists at artworks on Bencab that have been previously displayed at Pinto Art. Not 100% sure about this though. I enjoyed our own quiet time looking at art and also appreciating nature outside the museum. It's my first time in the museum and I feel like I haven't fully appreciated what the place has to offer. So I will definitely come back and give it a second visit the next time I am in town."
BenCab Museum,"Museum had a good range of exhibits and a koi pond. There is no Grab service here, so be prepared with your return transportation in advance."
BenCab Museum,An awesome museum. Very nice collection of art. The cafe and outdoor area is definitely worth exploring
BenCab Museum,"A lot to see in this museum, worth the entrance fee of P120 pesos per head. An array of paintings and varied artworks of talented artists are on display to amaze and tickle one's mind. 😉 There's also a café on the lower level to satisfy one's hunger pangs! Very nice garden, too! Must-visit when in Baguio!"
BenCab Museum,We paid 150 pesos (adult rate - if I remember correctly) for entrance fee. And I think it's worth it especially if you are fascinated with arts. You can go here via local jeep. And go back to the town via jeep as well to save you money.
BenCab Museum,"It's a beautiful place for art lovers. Entrance is P150 each, but offer discounts to all student, PWD and Seniors just present your ID's.Bencab is closed every Monday. Open from 9am to 6pm Tuesday to Sunday."
BenCab Museum,"A multi split-level museum with specific room for sculptures, relics, artworks, etc. which help us to roam around the museum without any hamper and foot traffic. They also have cafe at the lower ground of the building which a lil bit pricey. But all-in-all, it's a good place to relax and get some ideas if you're into arts.By the way, don't forget to bring your student i.d. 😉"
BenCab Museum,I am really amazed by the artworks presented as well as the history presented by mr. Dizon from his memory. It has a cafe inside. Tours in the museum depends on the number of people you are in a group. Nevertheless you could just tour it by yourself and take the time that you want. Wood arts are also presented by the culture of benguet. Amazing!!
BenCab Museum,The place is quite far but you can easily ride a taxi going here. Entrance fee is P120 pesos per person. There are parking spaces available for those who will bring their own car.The place has good collection of paintings and sculptures. The view is alao instagram worthy. You can also eat at Cafe Isabel.
BenCab Museum,"Such a very maintain place, wonderful and very educational,  children will enjoy looking around. Seing the masterpieces of different artists. The place also displays the beauty of nature with is island gazebo."
BenCab Museum,"Great artwork pieces by BenCab and other Filipino artists. I love the landscape behind the building and the view of a hill across which is fully covered with trees. It is just so beautiful, so relaxing. They serve good food too...a must visit in Baguio. Entrance is P150 but all worth it."
BenCab Museum,"Beautifully landscaped garden and forest trail, awesome sceneries to behold, very stress relieving! Varied and interesting paintings, stimulates the creative side of visitors!"
BenCab Museum,"We visited the Bencab Museum during our 3 nights stay in Baguio City, on our way to Banaue, January 2016. We got a very good, friendly & very knowledgeable young man as Museum Guide. It was a very interesting & informative museum visit with regards to native history & art. We also managed to have coffee & ice cream in their cafeteria. It is located outside the City but definitely worth visiting for a few hours. Highly recommendable."
BenCab Museum,"A nice way to know the indigenous tribe of the Cordilleras..You can have a Museum tour cost of P150 per head. See all the greates art of Ben Cabrera and artifacts from the tribes displayed on the museum.You can also get the eco tour for P150 per head, guide included and stroll on the vast 6 hectar total garden. Learn about some of the native tribes and anjoy the view.Meals are available as well on their Cafe.A bit pricey for the water. P60 per 500ml bottle but the bottle says all sales will got to charity... 🤷‍♂️"
BenCab Museum,"LIKE A HAIKUBy: Jeannie E.JavelosaToday, I entered a haiku poem. in three parts:  the Beauty of Art expressed. Nature’s Spirit speaking.  Palate pleasures pursued. Here visiting an old friend’s museum in Benguet and all at once a package of world class experiences curated by our National Artist BenCab, emerges. Paintings, prints, his collection of bulol rice grainary traditional sculptures, contemporary art of artists he supports are the first come-one; then, an Eco-hike that takes you around the museum (including farm plots where vegetables are grown for the cafe Sabel), and into the wild of the mountain trail. The prize? Spectacular views, waterfalls  and clean mountain air.  We cap our experience with delicious farm to table slow-food type cuisine (fried itik which is a local duck, watercress salad, creamy risotto like mountain rice, pumpkin-carrot soup and mountain rice suman sa latik) as one looks out into the hill slowly disappearing from view as the fog quietly engulfs it.  So quiet this place...as we were the only ones there. Until Ben comes out and a weird reunion of sorts with masks and social distancing mark our place and the unique time we are in. But no matter... for the experience of beauty that he has created in his destination place here in Tuba, Benguet stops all time - past, present and future. A place we always would want to return to. For it is like a timeless masterful haiku poem that fills both spirit and senses. #travelswiththejeannie #supportlocalbusinesses #slowtravel #naturelover #journeywiththejeannie"
BenCab Museum,"It's a nice place for people who knows how to appreciate art. There are lots of art to see. The the type of art in this museum is not so intriguing for me, since I'm not an art enthusiast myself. But it's a friendly place for instagramers and people who pretends to know art. #eisenphireChecked"
BenCab Museum,"First of all, the museum is located a bit far from the city so you have to arrange a transportation back and forth.It's a three storey museum filled with artworks, paintings and sculptures about northern cultures. You'll get to know more of their history by visiting this place. Perfect venure for art lovers.The garden at the back helps you forget your problems for a while lol. Sitting in the cottage gave me the most relaxing 15 minutes of my life 😁."
BenCab Museum,"Awesome museum with a large collection of Filipino art - paintings, sculptures, furniture and indigenous pieces. The displayed art pieces are not only by Ben Cab (owner) but also by other Filipino artists. The general admission of 150 php is very worth it.The museum is very contemporary with spacious white interiors. There is a cafe at the lower floor which faces a koi pond and garden. The museum also offers an ecotrail/ hiking which has a separate fee. Highly recommended for tourists visiting Baguio."
BenCab Museum,Very nice work of art. The place is fantastic with great view. entrance fee is 150-200 per person cant remember the exact price.
BenCab Museum,"If you love paintings, this is your place to go. Staff are accomodating and the place is not crowded. You will also love the outside ambiance if the weather permits. There is a cafe also if you'll feel famished."
BenCab Museum,"Great artworks, great views.There’s a Cafe at the first floor (Cafe Sabel) with a great view of their pond and mountain ranges with lushes of greens."
BenCab Museum,"There so many art pieces to be seen and to be loved. If you are an art lover or love the Philippine's history, culture and tradition, this place is very worth visiting!"
BenCab Museum,"Excellent lay out with a good, varied collection of art work. Not a very big museum which makes it manageable.Nice cafe on site and also well presented garden area for a short stroll.If you're lucky you'll be able to meet the maestro himself who is always willing to spend a few minutes with you and have a photo with you. A real gentleman.Well worth a visit if you're in Baguio."
BenCab Museum,"BenCab Museum is a little bit out of the way compare to other Baguio sites, after all its in Tuba. The road going here is a little bit quite and lonely since its far from other tourist spots but the visit was indeed a very memorable one. BenCab Museum showcases not just Cordillera's arts and sculptures, it also houses contemporay arts made by young artists. The museum was a work of art and it complements the serene environment it was situated.A definitely a must visit place."
BenCab Museum,It’s an honor to have visited a national artist’s museum.
BenCab Museum,"Beautiful artwork. Great destination for solo or small groups. Lots of stairs, don't bring grandparents"
BenCab Museum,Love this musuem. Small but includes worthy artworks. Entrance fee cost 120 pesos. For public transportation from city center it costs us 250 pesos (fix rate not metered as per the taxi driver since it is far) around 20-40mins travel time depending on the traffic. nice view and you get to see different types of art pieces.
BenCab Museum,A must place to visit to those who have a  heart for arts.Very interesting and some of the sculptures or artifacts were a representation of ethnicity in the mountain province.And also the garden at the back of the museum is a good place to relax and enjoy the view of nature.
BenCab Museum,One of the best museums Ive ever been to. Literally one of the most facinating and most chic. Contemporary arts and a pinch of surrealism. Everything s is just love!
BenCab Museum,"Great artwork from awesome artist. Amazing ideas ,?creativity and imagination. Beauty is on the eye of the beholder ,as said. You gonna love it ,if your fond of arts."
BenCab Museum,Brings the artistic you with mesmerizing art display. Gives you the throwback feel from the early Filipino culture. Wasn't able to try the food serve here since we have a reservation with another location. But definitely a place you need to visit when your in Baguio.
BenCab Museum,"Cool museum put up by the Ben Cabrera if you like and enjoy arts as personal expression. Entrance fee at 150/ head. Not too crowded this time, although travel is quite around 30-45min from the city center. Enjoyed the variety of art pieces and how they were put together for the public to realize we have great local artists! Great work!"
BenCab Museum,This place reminds me of the Met museum in NYC which is cool! Def worth the visit if u ever go to Baguio!
BenCab Museum,Beautiful museum. Worth the drive over. Real nice art and an amazing lunch cafe with crazy good prices and nice view of gardens and fish pond.
BenCab Museum,Nice place to visit since there were really few people
BenCab Museum,Amazing place to enjoy the afternoon. Outstanding artwork and artifacts. There is a gallery hosted within that has rotating exhibits to purchase from as well. The cafe and grounds are a good place to relax and enjoy the views.
BenCab Museum,The place is huge and of course full of art pieces. It is 25 to 30 minutes away from Baguio City. You can ride a jeep that cost 12pesos or take a taxi for 190 to 220pesos (depends on traffic).
BenCab Museum,Great exhibit. ❤️I also love the view in this place. 😍
BenCab Museum,A Very nice Museum worth visiting with family or friends.  Excellent paintings and different art works can be seen here.
BenCab Museum,"I was able to appreciate the work in a quiet atmosphere, and it is healing in a pretty garden."
BenCab Museum,"This superb museum is one of the best places to visit in the whole of the Philippines. Located in a beautiful valley in BenCab's very own estate, this is a stunning home for some outstanding artwork. EcoTours of the estate are also available and last approx. 1hr (additional charges apply). The cafe is excellent too. The artefacts from the Cordellera are also excellent with a vast collection from all over the region. This really is an outstanding place to visit. Visit time for the gallery is about 1hr but you can easily stay longer if you want to eat, do the ecotour or just simply enjoy the view. Wildlife lovers should also enjoy the variety of bird life especially the numerous sunbirds in the surrounding gardens."
BenCab Museum,"It’s quite a distance from downtown Baguio but the half-hour trip was worth it. This lovely, well-curated art museum showcases the rich culture of the Cordillera highlands and the work of local artists. Each floor on the museum has a scenic lookout offering panoramic views of the surrounding mountains. There is also a café serving local dishes and drinks.For those taking public transportation, it is relatively easy to reach the museum by cab or jeepney. From the museum, however, there is a bit of wait for cabs and the ones that do arrive are most likely dropping off visitors. It can therefore be a challenge finding a cab an hour or so before the museum closes. The jeepney stop is not far away but if you arrive to a near-empty jeepney, there will be a bit of a wait too. I saw people trying to hitch a ride in vain."
BenCab Museum,"Place is quite a good time to spend in. For art appreciation lookers or museum hoppers. Food in cafe Sabel was quite pricy, there a resto nearby Happy Tummy, you cam try it for those who dont habe thick wallets"
BenCab Museum,"Visiting the BenCam Museum is quite refreshing even if you are not an art enthusiast, the museum has a small entrance fee and photography is allowed except for professional photography and no selfie sticks. The museum has different levels that houses contemporary arts from painting to sculptures, from wooden sculptures to ceramics, they have also a lot of photographs and stencils and if your really appreciate art you would enjoy this visit. I like visiting museums and art show whenever I travel or whenever its possible, the building is modern, clean and tidy. I enjoyed the art collection but the genre of the art isnt for me, I more enjoyed european medieval arts, or ancient greek, roman and egyptian arts but like what I said its a contemporary art collection. The ground level has a cafe where you could refresh and relax, there is also a pond and a nipa hut in the middle where we spent some time. The museum is far from the city centre, we took a cab to the museum and we left the museum before dark fall and there are no cabs outside, luckily the employees are also going home and an empty jeep is waiting for them, we took the same ride. Its worth a visit, something new. They do have a lot of penile sculptures, penis is a big part of the culture."
BenCab Museum,"You'll appreciate it if you're into arts. Other than that, there's a cafe and a big garden if you want to chill"
BenCab Museum,"30 mins away from Burnham Park when you ride a jeep (this includes waiting for taxi/jeepney), can rate going there is Php 177 as of December 2019, jeepney rate is 11 pesos per head, Bencab entrance 100 for senior citizen, 150 for regular adult, 120 for students, no credit card available for now, cash basis only,"
BenCab Museum,"Disadvantage for groups/ family who will not ALL go inside the museum, you have to pay before using the toilet . However, the place is serene and the artworks is something we can be proud of as filipino."
BenCab Museum,"Inspiring place for those artists and non-artists. Didn't know Ben Cab is such a talented one. He uses different media in his crafts. You will also discover different artists and artworks in this museum. Very affordable price and you will appreciate nature here, as well! ❤"
BenCab Museum,First time here and I love it. A bit far from the city center. I wish we went there a bit earlier.
BenCab Museum,Great place to see Bencab's work and those of other local artists too.Entrance fee is Php100 for adults. Not a lot of parking spaces available but they allow you to park along the street. Place is pretty busy on weekends.We didn't know there were guided tours and we missed it. I'm sure the tour would have been very informative and educational. Our trip to Bencab was still very good.Make sure you set aside time to hang out in the garden.
BenCab Museum,"There are a variety of artworks shown for everyone's enjoyment. From historical pieces to contemporary artists that has a unique perspective to an eco-trail (not available as of June 14, 2022), this is a great family-friendly destination!"
BenCab Museum,"Place is a bit far from the city center, but people go here nonetheless to see and appreciate the art works by Ben Cabrera. The art pieces are stunning. Place is well-maintained but I'm reserving my one star for a full 5/5 because some of the lights shining on the paintings were flickering."
BenCab Museum,There are art pieces everywhere you turn! It's a really cool museum with nice views from the veranda. The only downside is the location which is a little far from the town center.
BenCab Museum,Visit the museum early if you want to enjoy and appreciate the art pieces. …More
BenCab Museum,"A nice place to be in. Sourrounding yourself with nature and art, it was more than satisfying. I saw a collection there dated 15-16th century works of remrandt and so on.  It was amazing! As an art enthusiast myself i got to see amazing works of art from filipinos such as bencab ofcourse. You cant go to baguio without visiting this place!😍😍😍😄😄😄🙄😀"
BenCab Museum,"This is a really  must  see Museum.  Great artworks, Ben was there  when we're  there. 120  Peso is really  worth:)But  the cab  that wait  for us charged us a 700 peso just  for  a 30minutes  of waiting.  Bloody  Hell.  Can't  do  anything."
BenCab Museum,"A must for those whose into arts. Do ask for a guide to appreciate the museum. There are many instagram worthy locations within the museum, just be creative."
BenCab Museum,This place is a must see if you are in Baguio. …More
BenCab Museum,"The Museum was great BUT the cafe has a long way to go to be, at least, ok.The surrounding area is exceptional. I will keep going back to that cafe as their Ceasar's salad was wilted and had soggy croutons (so soggy that it felt it was left out for a few hours or so). Upon complaining with Mike, the supposedly manager, he just smiled and said sorry like it was just to brush me away. Insulting and very improperly impolite to just accept how bad his product was.That experience was enough to upset my whole itenerary of leisurely taking in the grounds and the art.Disappointed here."
BenCab Museum,"Lots of places to take pictures here, another good place to stop over when you visit baguio"
BenCab Museum,"Loved the exhibits, the museum architecture, and the ponds at the bottom part. Nice view as well, towards the late afternoon."
BenCab Museum,"If you're into Art of any form, and painting, you'll surely love this place. Indoor and outdoor, the place is IG worthy. You also get to learn a little of the PH culture and history. Worth visiting when you are in Baguio. Been here twice (2014) and last Nov 2019,but will surely comeback to this place again if I visit Baguio."
BenCab Museum,Things you should do in baguio list amazing art and creativity nice background area pond and cafe was great good food they have little strawberry farm so no need to visit strawberry farm in la Trinidad if you been to Bencab they try to build more garden thing at back I like to visit soon and must have car or ask the taxi pick u up certain time specially at late afternoon they close at 5pm
BenCab Museum,"It was pretty good place, but i don't want to say u must visit bencab. If u want to go there without a car, I suggest u make sure how to return after enjoying Bencab. There was no taxi. I had to walk to a jeepney stop for 10 mins and wait there for 10 mins."
BenCab Museum,Great place to visit. Just be careful with umbrella thefts. You will be able to see the creativeness of every artist who's work are displayed within the 4 story building. They also have an econtrail. Did not try it because of the heavy rain during my visit.
BenCab Museum,"Really love the place, it's to die for. The view is breathtaking 🤩 …More"
BenCab Museum,A famous local museum in Baguio City oftenly known for its vast collection of artifacts from its indigenous people and creations from the local famous painter bencab. They also serve local cuisine from their inhouse restaurant but although a famous museum service from their restaurant is quite slow. 😋😋 but overall good place with not so much people. 👍👍

BenCab Museum,The gallery is amazing! There is this awe in every piece! They have a scheduled guided tour but we couldn't make it. 3 times a day I think? They also have a garden below and they offer an eco trail for the garden haha.. The entrance fee for the museum is 150.00 if my memory serves me right. I could spend hours here. Haha
BenCab Museum,150 pesos entrance fee. Worth the money as there are a lot of art pieces on display. Plus the breath taking view of their eco trail. Wished we got to inquire about the eco trail (heard it was worth it).
BenCab Museum,This museum is worth the trip when in Baguio not just for art experience but for the great natural views and serene surroundings.
BenCab Museum,"The place is far from the rest of the city but it is definitely worth it. Is cultural, modern and very artistic. I really liked my experience because there's freedom in taking photos like copying the poses in the paintings. The architecture of the museum is also amazing. There's a cafe at the lower ground which quench my thirst."
BenCab Museum,We always enjoy visiting the BenCab Museum whenever we visit Baguio. Not easily accessible but sure worth the side trip!
BenCab Museum,"We went there just this afternoon. The gallery is nice and curated arts were superb. 👌 Also, there are few people coming in so we got a chance to get good photos. The museum is located on the outskirts of Baguio and expect a mild delay on transportation as taxis are limited though there's a jeep terminal somewhere nearby. The museum offers cafeteria inside and a souvenir shop."
BenCab Museum,"BenCab works epitomize the struggles of his generation, of Philippine history. His collection of arts and sculptures at his museum is one for the books when you visit Baguio."

BenCab Museum,I try not to take many pictures of myself and just truly appreciate the people's art but my companion insisted. nevertheless if you want to escape a routine drive to the mall or a store this place is haven for thinkers and dreamers. Also they have a cafe that serve good food. Kind of sad though most people who goes there are more interested in selfies than history.
BenCab Museum,Superb!♥️ Amazing!🤩 …More

It is best to come here on off-peak days (weekdays) so there are less people to crowd the exhibits.The museum is multi-level (expect lots of stairs) with a cafe/restaurant on the lowest floor. The cafe sources ingredients from their own farm. There is also a scenic view deck with a view of the mountains, take the time to visit the view deck as it's very easy to miss the door leading to it.They have a guided eco-trail tour which will take you around their farm and various other spots where you can see huts, gardens, and a little bit of forest."

BenCab Museum,Was really really great! Seeing a lot of artworks of Filipinos!
BenCab Museum,"Nice place, try and see the mini water falls..."
BenCab Museum,"If you're into art, this is a good place for you to go. I think BenCab showcase the culture of baguio, aligning the past to present society. You could see Japanese and american portraits and even european influence to his art style and other artist. Through their art, it felt like you're traveling through time from the start of pre colonial era and how relevant and important these cultures are in the present time. It's a must visit placePlus they have a restaurant thst you could try after looking at the exhibits."
BenCab Museum,"It's not just a museum. It's a great place to relax as well. Its location provides a good view on the outside so guests can appreciate both human creativity and nature. It also has a cafe, so guests can enjoy warm refreshments and a nice meal after touring the museum. There is a garden and a small pond with an island gazebo outside so guests can take great pictures. The museum also offers a 1-2 hour nature hike package."
BenCab Museum,"If you're fond of arts this place may be your thing. Also, the food house overlooking the nature is really worth the while."
BenCab Museum,What i love about this place is it brings you close to nature while appreciating art.
BenCab Museum,Nice place to visit if you love arts. Food prices are a little expensive pero masarap. 👌it would be better if they separated politics from their museum. 😊
BenCab Museum,"If you like arts, then you'll love this place."
BenCab Museum,Still good for the artworks. But you can't even use a tripod or a selfie stick. The price has also increased to P200 per person
BenCab Museum,Nice place to relax.. coffee is a little bit pricey
BenCab Museum,They also  have a resto and nice looking view of mountains and their garden  so its good to go their and eat if you guys got hungry after...Prepare to rent a taxi coz its hard to get one... Or if you ok waiting for the jeepney to come
BenCab Museum,If you are a lover of art then this is for you and nice spot for photo ops
BenCab Museum,This place is food for the soul. Their mouth watering food is a great plus. Ben Cab to the National Artist is a great host
BenCab Museum,"We're absolutely amazed at all the sculptures, paintings, and other works of art by BenCab and other artists. If they could offer quick (or even long-term) classes on  drawing, painting, or scupting, that would be awesome."
BenCab Museum,Amazing artworks! 😮Entrance fee: Php150
BenCab Museum,Best for those with eyes for aesthetics. Get ready for your instagram-worthy photos!
BenCab Museum,"Different type of art works is in display of the whole museum. From the old times to the traditional and now, the modern art, all is in display of the museum. Different pieces of different artist, not only of the known artist BenCab is in there. The scenery of the overlooking is also a great sight. The entrance fee for a museum is a little bit high but still it still is worth the pay especially if you're a art guy.Also there is a small restaurant at the bottom of the museum that is managed by the museum it self. The food is great, the service is also good. The garden is free to visit and take a leisure walk and take a lot of pictures because of the good landscaping."
BenCab Museum,"Lots of paintings, sculptures, in different styles, for different ages, up to those who are interested in erotic art. The museum is of multiple floors, with art works presented and grouped in rooms. There is a cafe inside the museum. Nice outdoor view, with hut and plenty of plants. Getting here can be by taxi at a reasonable rate, or jeep for a more affordable rate if you are willing to wait."
BenCab Museum,Bencab must be on your itinerary. I just wish there's another entrance straight to the cafe
BenCab Museum,Expensive entrance fee considering the numbers of artwrork that you will see inside. Clean toilet.
BenCab Museum,Good place for the people who love arts.
BenCab Museum,"One of the most celebrated wood carver,  painter,  a national artist who takes great pride in his work. Each painting, each carving was a representation of how he expresses himself.  Each gallery has a theme and group accordingly. A view of the garden at the back of the gallery/museum was also great for selfies or groupies. But I suggest to learn about the stories each painting inside the museum before taking pictures. There's also a cafe at the ground floor leading to the back garden. I've been here once and that was back in 2010. It was December and tourist was scarce that time. Had a photo even of the fog..  Try to visit if you happen to go to Baguio. The museum wasn't far from the city proper. You could also ask directions from locals and they will help you."
BenCab Museum,Good place good ambience nice art displays. …More
BenCab Museum,Nice Museum/Gallery..
BenCab Museum,"Clean. Interesting. We'll kept. Definitely worth a stop, with a nice cafe and view after th art."
BenCab Museum,Nice place
BenCab Museum,"A really good place to appreciate art. Apart from the art itself, the museum has a cozy ambiance which gives that serene and laid back feel. The cafe is strategically located at the lower ground, best for having tea or coffee after the tour around the museum."
BenCab Museum,I Love mr. Cabrera's collections.. the guides are friendly  and the view outside is amazing.. i
BenCab Museum,"BenCan Museum is a must see for any visitor or local alike. A short review cannot encompass all the reasons, suffice to say its a great place to see the works of many of the accomplished and emerging serious artist of Northern Luzon and of course of BenCab himself. There are awesome rotating exhibits in the gallery and the grounds are beautiful. The whole museum and grounds are a kind of work of art in totality!  You really must see to appreciate!  Nice cafe to😋"
BenCab Museum,An amazing collection of paintings and various forms of art. Benedicto Cabrera at its best.
BenCab Museum,"A year ago my family went there to enjoy the sceneries and the works of art that the place could offer. The place was wonderful and the art works were really speaking to me. The only thing that was below expectation was the food and the expensiveness of it. I would have gladly spent money but the food was not even that special. Overall, if you want to appreciate art you should go here."
BenCab Museum,"The place is huge with so many artworks to see, coupled with amazing scenery from the viewing decks as well as the outdoor section. Went with teammates as last leg of team building activity, I wasn't able to enjoy it as much though, since I brought my toddler along and there were lots of 'do not touch' signs. 😅"
BenCab Museum,A place where you could appreciate nature and art at the same time. It is a small but cozy museum. Artworks and sculptures displayed are mixed of modern and classic art. There's a lot of IG worthy spot.Entrance of 150 is reasonable although the place is a bit far from the city proper but it's worth it.
BenCab Museum,"Got to meet the national artist here, Ben Cabrera. Awesome. …More"
BenCab Museum,"The art pieces were really great, and the views are perfect for taking photos. There is a cafe inside the Museum which serves food and drinks. Great overall experience."
BenCab Museum,Best to go before they open at Nine am.
BenCab Museum,Not crowded. The art is not to my taste and the entrance fee is steep considering
BenCab Museum,Ifugao folk art with contemprary local artists in a unique gallery  good for a day tour.
BenCab Museum,Best place for art lovers and instagramable shots
BenCab Museum,"First, the paintings were made by different artists so you'll see different kind and type of paintings. Mr. Ben's masterpiece tho are superb, really great.  It will definitely inspire and motivate people who are into arts. Second, not only paintings are to see here but also lots of woodworks sculpted by awesome artists as well. Vintage sculptures are a must see. Third, some who didn't recommend the place were against the employees but for me they were actually nice. They will tell you things that you need to know before proceeding in the museum and there are comfort rooms you can use, for free. Lastly, you have to see the garden as well. I think I'll stop there. You have to see it yourself. :-)"
BenCab Museum,"Super love this art musuem. Been here 4 times but never get tired of going. Great exhibition of pieces by  national artist Ben Cabrera, up and coming artists as well as indigenous artwork from various native tribes found in the region. The museum is wonderfully designed and has a zen, relaxing atmosphere as well as a nice garden that you can stroll and relax in."
BenCab Museum,"A must visit if you like paintings, sculptures and arts in general . Its a 3 storey art museum with a cozy cafe. At the back of the building, there are fishes and huts where you can just sit and relax and enjoy the view of the nature. You can feel almost sleepy because of the fresh cold air."
BenCab Museum,"The place is quite a bit of a travel from the city centre. But people can easily access the place via taxi. Going back to city wont be a problem since there is high foot traffic in this area. You can also ask taxi drivers to wait for you too. While its a bit far, its totally worth your visit. It houses a lot of artwork paintings and others. There is also a gallery of artifacts from native times that will give you a glimpse of history. When taking pictures dont be shy to ask gallery attendants to help you out, they know the place too well and can do some unique trick shots. There is also a cafe available for visitors. Food is 4.5 out of 5. Try to take some time to explore their small garden and enjoy the view of the mountainside."
BenCab Museum,The place is a bit difficult to go to but worth checking out once. Pro tip: They also sell ube and/or strawberry taho outside the museum👍😍
BenCab Museum,"This is the only place that makes me keep coming back to Baguio! After finishing a tour in the museum which will definitely satisfy the artist in you, the cafe is absolutely heaven. Food is great and awesome although quite pricey. The view is amazing. Its quiet and perfect for those who are soul searching/ traveling alone."
BenCab Museum,Nature and Art. Even  just the act of exploring this place  is art in itself. A must see when in Baguio
BenCab Museum,"Wide range of art exhibits. Very nice view of landscape behind the museum, relaxing and you will appreciate nature. They have small cafe so you can have light snacks, coffee and other refreshments."
BenCab Museum,"Different one from the usual places to visit when in  Baguio, a bit pricey when it comes to entrance fee."
BenCab Museum,You will love the place whether you're a fan of Bencab/of art in general or not. Great that the museum encourages other artists and other genres by showcasing their works. The cafe has good food and great coffee. Highly recommended when you're in Baguio. 15-20 minutes from the city proper. Be there at opening time (9AM) to avoid the crowds (and traffic).
BenCab Museum,A good way to end your trip in Baguio with a stimulus of fascinating art.
BenCab Museum,"Nothing to see except for sculptures and paintings. If you are not an artsy person, this is not the place for you. Ticket cost at p150. They also have street parking.It's good though that you could stay at their coffee shop while your artsy friends are still busy analyzing the paintings and sculptures."
BenCab Museum,Great place to visit if you're passing by. Bonus: The restaurant is great.
BenCab Museum,Great art works..... world class masterpieces...
BenCab Museum,"My family and friends gave this place a visit last year. It was a nice break from the usual stuff that you can visit in Baguio. I'm not really into art but I enjoyed what they have on offer. It was raining when we visited ... that prevented us from viewing the ""park"" outside though."
BenCab Museum,Wonderful mix of Filipino art. I love its location in the valley below Baguio City. It feels like a space where you can take in the art in the peace of nature. Too bad too many people visit it. It's best to experience the museum during weekdays when visitors are minimal.
BenCab Museum,A great place to immerse yourself in the culture and indigenous heritage of the Cordilleras and in Ben Cabral's contemporary art.
BenCab Museum,Nice place to explore for knowing more the Cordillera culture.
BenCab Museum,"Very liberating art works and different from the usual museum because they exhibited not just the artworks but a garden and a cafe. While you can finish your visit half a day, you will fill fulfilled. and P150 is worth it."
BenCab Museum,"There were a lot of interesting sculptures that featured the wood-carving artistry of the mountain people. We came in on a rainy day and went down to visit the garden and koi pond. The place has a quiet, calming feel, surrounded by mountain peaks."
BenCab Museum,Nice place to visit. Art lovers will surely adore this place.
BenCab Museum,"Great artworks, great experience, wonderful visit. Highly recommended. 😊"
BenCab Museum,"It's very good to see Filipino heritage and arts.  It's a nice museum.  Worth visiting indeed.One issue is lack of wheelchair access, it's a new building and should have been built to cater for all.  Google maps said is is wheelchair accessible.. sadly it's not."
BenCab Museum,Lots of interesting art. The cafe has awesome ambiance.
BenCab Museum,Love the arts and sceneries. Very relaxing
BenCab Museum,Nice painting & art and location
BenCab Museum,"Temporary galleries makes it worth coming back to. The current exhibit about a travel diary made with watercolor was interestingly fun. The permanent artworks became timeless to my eyes. It is always worth noting that the view is very beautiful and lush, making the experience more pleasant.All is good except for the cafe, while it had good ambience, I am not really a big fan of what they offer. The coffee we got were too watered down and it was not worth our money.Try to go sometime without much tourists, it's one of the best museums in Baguio."
BenCab Museum,"We arrived 1hr before closing, the staff were not at all welcoming and at quarter to closing time were rushing us already to exit. We just paid entrance to eat at the resto, not much time to look at the artwork. We don't like the attitude 😒of the staff. Also, they were not properly wearing face shields when they require guest to wear them."
BenCab Museum,"If you're at Baguio, don't miss visiting this museum! It is quite far from Burnham park (as a point of reference) but our travel time took only less than 30 mins. The ticket price is less than 200 (150 I think?) and discounts are given to kids who can present their school ID upon buying tickets. There are a lot of magnificent paintings showcased in the museum, plus a breathtaking view located at the back of the museum. They also have a cafe store there if you got hungry during your visit there. Overall, our experience there is worthwhile, and we'll surely visit again once we return to Baguio."
BenCab Museum,"Small and beautiful museum. Owner is Mr. Bencab who is most famous artist in Philippines. Entrance fee is 150 pesos, inside cafe has nice and beautiful green view .  but during weekend so many tourists are there."
BenCab Museum,"Awesome, the location is so great away form the city's irritable noise, the climate is good also. Every art for me is a master piece, it never fails to amuse me. My concern was the front desk doesn't recognize my Student ID to avail the student discount but still I enjoyed and learne a lot."
BenCab Museum,"I enjoyed my trip here. The entrance fee of PHP150. 00 is reasonable enough since the museum houses the many different art collections of our national artist Bencab. When you see all his work you will really say that he deserved to be called the national artist. I admire his used of different medium in his work. I am quite astounded on his attention to details  that shows his passion and patience.The museum also has a breathtaking view of the adjacent garden, farm, hill and mini-forest. Plus the views of the surrounding mountains.There is also a cafe inside in which you can spend time with friends while enjoying a good meal."
BenCab Museum,I dont had much fun to take photos in this place..they dont aloud mono pod and i am touring by myself..just handling your phone cant get a good angle!
BenCab Museum,Taking the art and talent of Pinoy in an international level.
BenCab Museum,"Amazing museum, phantastic landscape, mind-blowing Eco tour, beautiful sunset and an absolutely delicious lunch in the Café!!! One of the best experiences in Baguio. Thank you Ben! ❤️❤️❤️"
BenCab Museum,Place has calming vibe and insta worthy. Try their pasta dishes it won't disappoint.
BenCab Museum,One of the must visit tourist spots in Baguio. Though the road to get there can be full of up and downhills the museum is definitely a must visit since it features a vareity of artworks from both famous and local painters. It also a restaurant and an outdoor park where you can take lots of pictures.
BenCab Museum,"If you're a person who appreciate art and enjoys looking at the beautiful art pieces, then this is a must-go-to place. The place is very far but the trip going up the museum is worth the travel. There is a cafe but the choice of food is limited. I would love to try it next time."
BenCab Museum,The place is so relaxing and cozy. The museum showcase the sculptures and arts and cultures of the natives. The location of the museum is really far from thr city but worth it. You can ride a jeep going back and forth or ride a taxi.
BenCab Museum,"My family and I wanted to come here to escape the overwhelming crowd in Baguio, hoping that it wouldn't be as such. However there were still so many people here although not as much.I've never been to this museum before and it was quite interesting. It showed the traditional arts of the natives. Guests can learn a lot about the culture and history of the region. Paintings and sculptures lined the walls although with penises and vaginas.The cafe was out of the blue serving pasta. Drinks were too sweet.Overall, I'd give this a recommendation for a visit in Baguio."
BenCab Museum,Lots of paintings and Ifugao related art. Huge place with coffee shop and a trial to enjoy. The only down is you can't appreciate the art as much since people are usually just taking photos around using the painting as backdrops.
BenCab Museum,"super great place to visit!!!! the paintings are really fantastic. wear your hiking shoes and take the guided tour of the eco-trail. nice view up there in the mountain- the beauty of nature. Ryan, the tour guide and photographer, did a good job in guiding us."
BenCab Museum,"The garden was a great addition to the museum. It gives diversity and a wonderful area for children to enjoy. Its a complete experience: art, culture, scenery and food. I just hope some of the gallery has  different motif."
BenCab Museum,"I've been to other museum, and i found this place inferior. Sort of over rated. Significantly small so you'll get bored easily. No comments about the artwork displays, just how the museum presents them; its so dull."
BenCab Museum,Place is cool and clean. Awesome artworks too.
BenCab Museum,"Great collection with a nice café. The house and the grounds/garden itself is amazing on it's own. There's a hiking tour you can try to explore the area. Good value for money as well, entrance is less than 200 php"
BenCab Museum,Nice view and all artworks ar splendid.
BenCab Museum,"Quite crowded when you go over the weekend. If you want to appreciate the beautiful artworks you have to visit during the weekdays.  Although far from Baguio city's central business district, you do not have to worry about food because Cafe Sabel is just at the ground floor of the museum."
BenCab Museum,We loved the garden view while enjoying cappuccino and turon ala mode at their Cafe Sabel. We also chased some fog. The museum itself gives you a proud feeling for having National Artist Bencab. We were lucky to have a chat with him and ask about his iconic Sabel among other things. It also features his collection of Cordillera art and culture as well as works of local artists
BenCab Museum,"I would consider this a must see, not only for the great museum and garden, but also for a good drive through suburban villages. I would suggest paying your cab to wait for you. The museum has a lot of traditional pieces and a lots of contemporary paintings."
BenCab Museum,Great place not so crowded... love the arts and paintings😇😇😇
BenCab Museum,Enjoyed every art piece and the place as well
BenCab Museum,"A bit challenging to find the place, but it was still worth the trip! Reminder to students to bring their IDs to avail of the discount- though the fee isn't that bad at P120/head. It might help to have someone on standby in each area who can provide more info regarding the displays in case the guests would want to know more."
BenCab Museum,"Definitely worth a stop, and probably worth a trip to Baguio just to see this museum and grounds. There is BenCab's own collection of important contemporary artists, historical local wood carvings and a great cross section of BenCabs.  Also walks though their farm and virgin nature trail."
BenCab Museum,"The place is kind of far from the city, however, this museum house a vast collection of artworks from artist all over the country. You can also appreciate nature through their garden behind the museum building! Be sure to ask your taxi driver to wait for you (for an additional price) since taxi's and jeepneys does not come by often."
BenCab Museum,Accessibility: It is along a main road and is accessible by private ride or taxi. Grab Taxi is available in Baguio City and you may hire the cab. Jeepneys also pass along the way.Ambience: Nature with a touch of modern architectureArt: The art pieces in the museum depict life in all aspects. My son enjoyed the tour.Cafe: It has cafe to quench your thirst and satisfy your palate.Guided Tours are available for the nature trails. Non guuded tours are limited upto the lagoon.
BenCab Museum,Nice view. Thick and luscious  trees infront of the view deck of the museum. There's snack area where you could buy and eat after an up and down walk looking to the art works.
BenCab Museum,You can find new taste here. Food is not cheap but is ok. Art is cool!
BenCab Museum,"Fabulous Museum and Garden.  National artist Ben Cabrera has assembled one of the best collections in the Nation, beautifully displayed.  Downstairs there is a lovely cafe with excellent coffee and meals."
BenCab Museum,if your curious about painting.. worth it to come here
BenCab Museum,Nice place to appreciate arts and nature but i find the entrance fee too expensive.
BenCab Museum,"Loved the art works, loved the location, loved the scenery"
BenCab Museum,"Bencab Museum is located along side Road in Tuba, Benguet,  The museum building built in a highland that has a magnificent view, alongside of a garden, farm with strawberries, hill and mini-forest. What an awesome view to relax and have some fresh and cool air of natures."
BenCab Museum,"Nothing much to say beyond what others have. Fantastic museum. Could easily lose many hours here which is surprising given it is really not all that big. You find yourself moving slowly, taking in every piece. Memorizing. The staff are friendly too."
BenCab Museum,Artworks and sculptures displayed are diverse of modern and classic art. Entrance fee is 150 pesos. Place is well-maintained. This place is worth the visit though it is too far from the city.
BenCab Museum,Known for its IG-worthy spots
BenCab Museum,"B E N C A BI've enjoyed it so much. The four-level museum is packed of creativity and talent. Also, I love the eye-relaxing view with beautiful landscape (with pond and a hanging bridge which leads to an eco-trail along a forested slope).They also have a restaurant/cafe na super sarap ng mga foods. A visit to BenCab is highly recommended. Worth it yung binayad nyo!"
BenCab Museum,Most of the people who i bring here in the museum appreciates it and love the scenery. Its surrounded by mountains and they added a trail activity that comes with an additioanal fee.i highly recommend this place for people who also wanna learn a bit of cordilleran culture. Take nite that they are close on mondays :)
BenCab Museum,Amazing! The artworks are so breathtaking you won't realize the place is three storey. Lol
BenCab Museum,Wasn't able to take pictures because I was too busy admiring the artwork. This place is worth the trip. I personally think the fee they charge is way low for what you get to experience. This is a must visit!
BenCab Museum,Nice exhibit of native art.Sufficient parking.
BenCab Museum,"Awesome place. Taxi cabs will ask somewhere between Php300-400 per hour just to wait. Ask to just flag the meter going there and another meter going back. And just give them Php100-200 to wait an hour. Anyway, they wont be spending for gas and effort just waiting for you while you tour the museum. It will take you about 1 hour touring the museum, looking at art, and taking selfies at the garden. It doesnt include when you want to dine though."
BenCab Museum,A fresh relief from the Baguio busy streets. You can also find works of other artists. Try to come earlier in the morning or off peak days to digest each art piece without the too much crowd. The usual flow of guest comes after lunch. Entrance fee is 100 peso but for students and senior citizens its 80 peso but a valid ID must be presented.
BenCab Museum,"I went there on Friday 8Feb 2019What a great place. If you are coming to Baguio, this Art Gallery is a must. They have a nice coffee shop on level 4 which serves light lunches. (GOOD COFFEE) Expect top spend at least 3 hours there viewing the art work. It's VERY impressive and not what you would expect from Baguio.If you want a more extensive lunch, try Happy Tummy, 2 doors up Asin Rd.If you are taking a Jeepney down, it costs P11, and you take it from the top of the Maket Place about 200meters below the  Baguio police station. If you are not sure where, make sure you ask someone. Ask for Km6 Asin Rd"
BenCab Museum,Chill place to appreciate artwork. Hard to go to and come back to the city if you have no car of your own just fyi. The garden is gorgeous and very good for picture purposes.
BenCab Museum,I'm not an artsy person. But I liked this place because the art pieces are organized well. Aside from that there's a cage and pond area at the lowest level perfect for picture taking.
BenCab Museum,Impressive art collections and nature park
BenCab Museum,Entrance fee is Php 150 which is not that bad considering the aesthetics of the place and the art pieces it has on display. It also has a very nice view of the houses on the side of the mountains.
BenCab Museum,"To appreciate culture and arts, visit BenCab Museum. Serves good coffee too."
BenCab Museum,Really nice collection. Don't forget to bring student's ID for discounted entrance fee
BenCab Museum,If you wanna see some artworks from ben cabrera go here. The artworks are good but the scenery appeals to me more. The place is beautiful with its scenery and I suggest you try their paid tour it's worth 80 maybe. You get a tour guide and go to the trek not accesible to those who do not pay for the tour.
BenCab Museum,Very nice and artistic place
BenCab Museum,"The place  is not that crowded when  we went there. The entrance fee is P150. They have a cafe inside (groundfloor level) the price ranges from P200 & up. They also have an Ecotour (P150 fee + P100 for the guide) an hour walk where you can see the garden, ponds, cross 2 bridges, Danom Falls, a bit of trail (pero hihingalin ka if hindi ka sanay sa mga paakyat) & old houses of different tribes."
BenCab Museum,"Relaxing place, good food (although slightly expensive for Baguio standards), good curation of artwork, great view. Recommended for art enthusiasts or those who want to have a chill baguio experience. My only issue is that the tour guide, a student trainee at that time, wasn't really efective and didn't explain anything. Would've been a good opportunity to train the student and at the same time impart knowledge to guests."
BenCab Museum,"My dream place, the behind part is better than the facade."
BenCab Museum,✨     Great place
BenCab Museum,Wonderful work of art and view are one of the best
BenCab Museum,Great artworks from various artists.
BenCab Museum,"It's good. If you are art lover, this is the best place for you. The ticket is 150 pesos. You can roam around the museum in 20 minutes."
BenCab Museum,Very nicely maintained art museum with an interesting collection of works in a beautiful setting. Worth the trip from Baguio City (PHP 11 by Asin Jeepney or about 170 by taxi).
BenCab Museum,Interesting collections of artifacts and paintings from different times and styles.
BenCab Museum,Its a nice place for artlover..
BenCab Museum,It's amazing to masterpiece of our own artists
BenCab Museum,Amazing place to appreciate art more.
BenCab Museum,"Love the art museum and history behind artifacts in the Cordillera Gallery. Haven't tried their eco-trail but seeing it from afar and the people hiking, I'm sure the experience would be great. ☺️"
BenCab Museum,Still creepy as it used to be.One problem with us Filipinos is that we lack appreciation of history and for this reason we don't care about maintaining cultural heritage. Extra effort must be done to avoid more vandalism inside and out the old building.
BenCab Museum,"Many items om exhibit and nice trail. Excellent view. However, resto is expensive and public transport is a bit hard. Taxis reject hailing passengers when they say they want to got to bencab."
BenCab Museum,"Entrance : 150 adults, Eco trail for 1 hour is 100. With discounts for students, group tours and seniors.Cafe Sabel is located at the ground floor (2 level down from main road) where you can enjoy their foods and other drinks. Try spicy tuyo pasta if you're into hot and spicy foods."
BenCab Museum,"If you love art and paintings, this is the place for you in Baguio. However, it is a little bit fatmr in the city. Probably u neednto rent a cab as your transportation. However, the place is IG worthy with nice view in their balcony."
BenCab Museum,"Remote place but its worth the extra effort. If you cannot afford to buy artworks for sale, surely you can bargain hunt beautiful piece of wood carvings at local shops along the highway. If you are a fan of wood works, its heaven for you!"
BenCab Museum,We went there almost a month ago.I hope the collection was better.Anyway i love the view of the mountain scenery there.It was magnificent.Its just that i hope they could lower entrance fee to atleast 25% to make it more affordable for students.
BenCab Museum,"Good tour of artworks in different forms (paintings, carvings, etc). Food is okay as well. Breathtaking view esp. with presence of fog."
BenCab Museum,"Must see museum. 120 pesos per head entrance fee. :) to get there, you can ride a taxi from town that will cost you around 100 pesos or take the jeepney. The jeepney lines are found in Kayang street (around 15 pesos, i think). There are parts of it that's not for kids 😂😉😉. Nonetheless, it's a wonderful place."
BenCab Museum,If you appreciate art? You nid 2 visit it.
BenCab Museum,"The museum of one of our Philippine National Artist. Art inspired by the Cordilleras and the Highlanders, and also their artifacts and heritage. There's art of other aspiring national artists as well. There's an art souvenir shop, a small café, a small park, and an eco-trail. Entrance fee is affordable, the café and shop is a bit pricey but has unique selections, and a separate fee for eco-trail with tour guide. If you're lucky you will see Mr. Ben Cabrera himself. Overall, it's still a worthwhile visit for art, highlander history, and nature lovers out there."
BenCab Museum,"We went here early because we know that the place is far from the city proper, but don't know how the traffic is going here. We arrived 30min early. We were told to stay outside in the parking area. We asked nicely if we can have monoblock chairs that we can sit on but staff was rude. Didn't enjoy the visit here. No customer service."
BenCab Museum,"Fantastic collection of paintings, sketches, sculptures, carvings and many otber works of art by national artist Ben Cabrera and other Filipino artists. Very nice food served at Cafe Sabel with vegetables grown and harvested fresh from the organic farm. Guided museum and ecofarm tours are available upon request."
BenCab Museum,Very cozy ambiance...a quiet place...the paintings are beautiful but i love the self portrait of sir ben cabrera which is seen or placed right at the top wall facing the the door which is the entrance..im just not sure if its still there because my last visit was way back 2009...
BenCab Museum,"From someone who admittedly isn't familiar with local art: I appreciated the garden more than the museum itself. Also, they should install an elevator for the elderly/disabled."
BenCab Museum,Experience nature and art at the Bencab Museum.
BenCab Museum,A nice place to see artworks. They allow picture taking as long as you don't use flash. Nice to sit in their cafe and just absorb the moment.
BenCab Museum,Cozy place. Love the cafe.
BenCab Museum,"Too far and too expensive.  At ₱120/head, the collection in not that great to come and visit.  Not Senior Citizens friendly as there is no elevator and it is 4 storey down.  Restroom is 1 per sex and it is located 3 floors  down.  Hotel Luna in Vigan has a better collection like Juan Luna, Amorsolo and the like masters and it is even free to see.  The painting collection in Bencab are young and mostly dark feel for me, the oldest 2 painting I noticed was by Joya and Sanso and they were small.Visitors are not even artistically interested as they were noisy and busy taking family and group photos. Heck they do not even know who Bencab is.  Because there were no guides.  Some visitors were even touching furniture peices that were older than their parents that were clearly marked fragile do not touch."
BenCab Museum,"Nice place to visit for appreciating art and ifugao culture, and sightseeing mountain view as well. They also offer various snacks and (non-alcoholic) drinks in their coffee shop."
BenCab Museum,"This art haven is awesome and relaxing. Art collections are solid and the location itself is very close to nature. It feels like you are in the midst of paradise, a gift from the creator where the art creations are also being housed."
BenCab Museum,"The place is nice seeing the art of Bencab, but I think the entrance fee of 150 is a little pricey for general public. I would say the price should just 100."
BenCab Museum,it was a place that showcases sculpture in the eyes of Baguio artistry. my kids and i were awed by the big space i believe 4 floors but the most amazing area was the garden.the backdraft of a very quaint bahay kubo surrounded by a mini version of rice terraces was  my fave. my kids though really wanted to embrace the colorfuk joyous koi fishes in the geometrically assembled ponds. my gosh dobt forget to go to tge farthest ends of the garden coz they seem to place very strategic photo opts areas to capture nature at its closest u can almost kiss God for putging these greens browns and even hues of red on the mountains.they have cafe sabel to satisfy craves for coffee and shakes while you sit on again colorful benches.4 because maybe tgey could have a small portion where kids can also play and make their own sculptures and maybe bring home or leave there display and so leavs the place feeling so proud and feeling a part of the museum.kudos....let's promote this as a Baguio voice for true artistry. the blood that criesHail not onlyBaguio bht Philiplines
BenCab Museum,This place is about 15 to 20 minutes drive from the Baguio City's CBD.This is one of the best museums I have been to. There are a lot of art pieces that you can marvel at. There is also a café where you can try different foods but please do not forget to try their BenCab's Brew (coffee). My favorite part of this place is their farm and garden!
BenCab Museum,"This is where National Artist (national treasure) Benedicto Cabrera “BenCab” houses his Cordillera art collection. It is in the outskirts of Baguio City, but it is only around 6 kilometers from Burnham Park or about a 20 minute trip by car, taxi or jeepney from the city. The street level gallery is the entry point where entrance fees are paid and brochure with museum map is released with the ticket. More art is displayed at the lower floors. On the bottom level is café ysabel where you step out from the museum building and onto the gardens, pavilion and ponds that await to be appreciated in your visual memories and in your ig feed."
BenCab Museum,Leonard Aguinaldo's work was superb
BenCab Museum,Really cool gallery. Enjoyed my visit here despite the storm.
BenCab Museum,"As I can remember, I am still shook on what I saw in the galleries. BUT!! BENCAB museum is a great place to visit, just be ready on what your eyes will see. ♥"
BenCab Museum,Beautiful scenery and artworks!
BenCab Museum,Showcases works of local artists in its museum.  Guests also have an option to roam around the property with its guided eco trail.  It has its own cafe as well.
BenCab Museum,We always pass by this museum when we are in Baguio.
BenCab Museum,It's a great place to go to when you're in Baguio. Ticket price ranges from 100-180 (forgot the actual price but students get discounted price just present their ID upon entrance)

BenCab Museum,Perfect for museum dates.
BenCab Museum,"It's a beautiful art museum which I never saw in such an area like in South East Asia. I was positively surprised by the quality of the museum, arts, architecture, structure and environment. If you are in Baguio then you should visit this museum."
BenCab Museum,Ben Cab Museum lives up to the national artist level that tourists exepect. It's beautiful that they also showcase different local artists in their gallery. The location of the museum is not in the route of jeepneys so you really have to ride a cab. Dont worry about getting back to baguio proper since there are people who arrive ridding a cab so you can ride theirs back to baguio proper and the security is courteous enough to assist you in getting a cab. A must see place when you go up  to baguio.

BenCab Museum,"Peices are great, the crowd isnt. I've been bumped on more than 3 times by people walking backwards taking selfies. Kinda ruined the experience for me. DONT GO ON A SUNDAY!"
BenCab Museum,"The view is mesmerizing. Though, most of the visitors are just there to take photos of themselves with paintings and sculptures. I hope people will spend more time in understanding the arts."
BenCab Museum,Educational but with less displays yet plenty of tourist
BenCab Museum,Good food nice artwork
BenCab Museum,A great place to unwind with your family and by taking a walk there will definitely destresses​ your soul!
BenCab Museum,"It's a homey museum with little farm, garden and restaurant. The mountain tricking is a plus itinerary while inside BenCab.Will bring visitors for sure."
BenCab Museum,"Many awesome reviews about the place so I'll just write about how to get there on public transport. Go visit. It's worth it.About 90 pesos to get there from Session Road in Baguio via taxi. Some charge a contract price. Highest I heard of was 250. I left that taxi and just waited for another.To go back to the city from BenCab, one can either wait for a taxi which is rare or just walk back a little bit maybe 5-10mins and get on a public jeep at St Joseph's Church. Fare is just 11 pesos. There's sometimes a jeep waiting and sometimes you just have to wait for one to come."
BenCab Museum,Nice local art! …More
BenCab Museum,Wonderful scenery and artworks. The food is delicious as well
BenCab Museum,"Beautiful and educational place. Fare from city through jeepney is just 11 pesos but youll have to walk a bit, it's manageable dont worry."

BenCab Museum,Great museum showcasing a great artist. Lots of locally sourced relics are on display as well. Definitely pass by the area if you are a fan of art.
BenCab Museum,It was refreshing to be at the museum. Artworks were one of a kind. I just wish they would have an escalator goiung up. It eas a challenge to walk up four floors.
BenCab Museum,This is more than a museum. Make sure you bring your cameras (or have your phones charged) as tons of instagram-able photos can be taken.
BenCab Museum,"The cabs are very cheap, you can ride a cab from City proper to Bencab and the fare is roughly 90php (depending on the traffic). Good place sans the cafe area where everything is overrated and overpriced."
BenCab Museum,Houses perhaps one of the largest collections of Bul' ul and Coldillera Arts.
BenCab Museum,Even non art enthusiasts like me will love BenCab Museum! 😃I visited BenCab Museum after standing for many hours from the Panagbenga parade. Visitors can surely relax at BenCab Museum.

BenCab Museum,Its a 15 min ride from the city. Great place for people who likes arts. There's a cafe quite expensive but the taste worth the money.
BenCab Museum,"Fusion of art and Cordilleran artifacts. Such a surreal museum. It's a museum with an attitude, a sort of mysterious bite but with a spit of calmness and serenity."
BenCab Museum,"Although difficult to get to, it's well worth the long drive up the hill. Check out the cafe downstairs.. there's some tasty treats awaiting you."
BenCab Museum,"The place was great, plus the Coffee shophad good food at a fair price, over all It was worth the Falling in linebefore you can enter the museum, before I forget there isan entrance fee."

BenCab Museum,They have new collections and featured artistt will defnitely go back!!
BenCab Museum,"If you're coming from Baguio City, expect a steeper drive on your way to BenCab."
BenCab Museum,Awesome art collection!!
BenCab Museum,"The P150 entrance fee is so worth it considering you get to explore three floors of various artwork, and roam the gardens that come with mountain views."
BenCab Museum,They should allow local residents rate... We bring tourists here it's our incentive somehow that we don't pay entrance anymore... I visited bencab 6 or 7x this year!!!
BenCab Museum,"It's a nice place to relax on the weekdays, walk around and spend some time at the cafe. But it gets crowded at times and becomes difficult to appreciate everything."

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This place is a aesthetically pleasing for people who have brave hearts. Well, I mean, you know the history. The air near the hotel is somewhat heavy for me and my other friends. But the place as I said is beautiful.I just hope their souls rest in peace and don't mind the visitors🙃🙂🤞"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Last time I went here was October 2019, where you can still go inside the building and climb up to the roof top. As you go inside, you’ll get that eerie feeling. There’s a fountain in the middle part where it feels so classic and vintage.Now, It’s 2022 and I went back with my partner. Tourists are no longer allowed to go inside due to the falling debris inside the building and for safety measures. You can still take pictures outside and within the premises. They now have an entrance fee of Php10.00 per head. They are only open up until 5pmFollow to catch up with me and my reviews! ✈️"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place was a bit crowded when we went in last March 20, 2022. Probably because it's the weekend and the restrictions were lifted. The place kinda gives you a creep but we find it amusing and amazing at the same time. The view is very calming as well and it's nice to take picture almost everywhere. Too bad we cannot go inside anymore not the same as 3 or 4 years ago. Overall we'd love to go back here when it's not that crowded anymore."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Simple and looks like it's ravaged by war kind of ambiance from the movies. Quick visit. Really old style preserved and only the façade is allowed for pics, can't get in due to renovation. There's entrance of 10 pesos for this outdoor pic. There's a garden nearby to unwind after if you like pine trees.This spot also has snack sellers, a place where you can take a break indeed.If you like old and dated, this is someplace to consider passing-by. Only, it's tough to get a solo pic at lunch time with lots of passers, so come early."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Wanna get spooked?Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden is the new name, Dominican Hill Retreat House as referred to before, to me it is Diplomat Hotel. Diplomat Hotel as it is called in the many TV shows that featured this edifice will scare you for the many elements that live in it.Did we get the vibe? Make a guess.We went here on a rainy afternoon. The rain beat us badly, we got wet. Thanks to the umbrellas that we have, it didn't soak us.Approaching the place made me think twice. I am skittish, jumpy, high-strung, even neurotic sometimes despite having so many horror books I have in my room or no matter how many hundreds of thriller-horror movies I already have watched and ghostly experiences I dealt with years back. So, I almost backed out but I did not. Thanks to my friends who laughed at me.We arrived a little past 5 pm. We paid for the entrance fee and waited patiently for our turn to have our picture taken in every part outside the hotel. Yes, outside the hotel. It is in renovation these days that we can only have a glimpse of this famous structure from the outside.Should I be thankful for that? Well, I guess not very because my heart secretly wanted to get in.Anyway, we meandered in the place for the remaining daylight there is and took photos of whatever we can. We went through a path in the garden and posed many many times for the camera for a souvenir that we braved the Diplomat Hotel. Hey, we loved the pictures by the garden. Braved if you can call it that way. Hey, we loved the pictures taken by the garden. It looked like from a fairy tale land.As for the spooks? Sorry, we didn't experience such. We're outside the building.We'll just go back sometime in the future to get this vibe."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This is a beautiful area and worth seeing, however I do wish there was a way to restore the old church back to its original state. We spent a couple of hours here looking inside the church from the outside. This church sits quietly on top of a small mountain. There were venders there and I tried yam ice cream for the first time. This is worth a visit for sure."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It’s been a decade before i went back here. More clean and many people becoming more interested in the place. But they don’t allow people enter the building maybe for safety purposes. I still amazed and grateful to be back    
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Hunted mansion but still very unique. Paid entrance fee of Php10.00. At first glance of the mansion, it looked scary.  It’s abandoned mansion with some horrifying stories. It has garden at the back and with a nice view of the community and there is another garden with paved walked way adjacent to the front of the mansion is a garden."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Quiet place for prayer but they were cutting trees when we visited. First time buying their Angel Cookies. Sweet but I liked them.There's a small place for candle lighting.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We visited  this place, yet they restricted  you to enter the main hotel due after the earthquake  because  the building  is quite old , and for the safety for all..Entrace fee is 10 pesos for adult and 5 for kids.Operated  by the lgu so quite reasonableOld building full of history.😃 👧 my pay, my say  😊"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It was sooo foggy when we got there around 4pm, feeling you are really in a hunted place 😱. Tourist are no longer allowed inside the building because of the falling debris, but you can take pictures outside of the eerie old building. It was constructed in 1913. You have to pay P10. entrance fee per head and closes at 5pm. You can take your best OOTD as the outside building facade is soo vintage and very beautiful but just be aware there might be a ghost or white lady behind you 🤪😂✌️👉 PS: You may watch, like, comment and SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel 😘"" Arlene Aces """
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The small garden at the left side of the Old Diplomat Hotel is worth checking, especially when it's dark. When we went there, the park was serene and no one was there but us. Great place to just sit down ang talk.When we went there Dec 2021, the Old Diplomat Hotel was closed because there were falling pieces of rocks from the wall and ceiling due to a previous typhoon. I hope they renovate and fortify it. The graffiti inside though was a bad choice for me. It took away the historical significance of the building."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,We love the plants around the vicinity. The building was closed when we visited and it was raining but still we enjoyed visiting and taking pictures around.10 pesos lang ang entrance fee and 5 pesos for children …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Historic places really has this chilling and thrilling experience in them. Will recommend this tourist spot, it's cheap, not very crowded, and very enjoyable at night …More"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A clean and quiet place, but you cannot enter the building due to the falling debris. Theres a small park where you can sit and relax. You cannot buy food and refreshments here."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This was the old Diplomat Hotel. It does not look scary when I went there coz there were a lot of people visited the are during the weekend. So.i.advised you to go during weekdays instead to avoid traffic. I think they are starting to renovate the place. It is close. You can't go inside the building.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,We wanted to go inside but the guard says that anyone was not allowed because some of the stones are falling down and might cause an injury when we got hit by it... it was quite creepy inside
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The Dominican Hill Retreat House, also commonly known as the Diplomat Hotel, is an abandoned structure atop Dominican Hill, Baguio, Philippines. It is now undergoing rehabilitation through the efforts of the city government. The whole property on which it stands has been renamed as the Dominican Heritage Hill and Nature Park. A panoramic view of the city unfolds from its vantage point, the stone crucifix on the outdoor patio of the hotel's second floor."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Went with my friend and we were both scared. 😂 we decided to have a walk around since it’s not allowed to enter the building, we went there at 6pm so it was really dark and it was raining. The parking is 10 pesos and the entrance is 10 pesos too. What a great experience. …More"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,WARNING: Hindi na pwede pumasok pero may entrance fee and parking fee pa rin. Budol. Waste of time. Do not go here. There is nothing to see but you will still pay. PLACE IS CLOSED. …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice place but could not enter at the moment bec of falling debris from a recent earthquake.View from outside still great
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Nothing much to see really. The last time we went here in 2014 we were able to enter the Diplomat Hotel, now it's just a walk around the area. …More"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Best time to visit around 4pm till closing time for you to feel the haunted vibes of the place. Happy Hunting Peeps! 😱😱😱
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I studied at Saint Louis University but didn't go to this place until my daughter told me about it. Located on top of DOMINICAN HILL, this historical place is a Monastery during Japanese invavsion. Also beside it is a big TABLET of the TEN COMMANDMENTS where it earned the Guinness Book of Records. …More"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Cold and nice scenery. 5:30 the guards alarmed us that the place will be close at exactly 6pm. There's an entrance fee of 25 pesos last February 2020, but last November 2019 no one asked us for the entrance fee. Maybe it is seasonal."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"it's an abundant building which is too old to live, but still with very nice out view."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Beautiful building. It didn't feel creepy at all in contrast to what the mainstream media is telling. Sadly you can only go and visit around the structure but not inside due to the damaged it incured. …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This place is really aesthetic ❤️❤️    
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Old Diplomat Hotel, Baguio City 👀• Visitors are not allowed inside. But you may take your photo-ops outside. 🙂• Open Mondays to Sundays, 6:00am to 6:00pmAdmission:• General Admission: ₱25.00Transportation Access:• Jeep: Ride a jeepney with the Dominican-Mirador route. The terminal is at Kayang Street in Baguio Public Market."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Tourist attraction but you can't go inside anymore. The building is considered too old and fragile.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Been here for many times. But still love to visit this place. Kinda scary and feels like a horror house to me. 👻
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Still under renovation when we visited. Area is very clean, you'll enjoy a nature stroll without minding the eerie feeling of the place even when you know the history behind it …More"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice place but it's no longer allowed to go inside.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The haunted diplomat hotel!! the way it built n left abandoned, with the eerie looks of fog  surrounding the place n chilling weather will give you a feeling of living in a horror thriller movie scene-for a while, better if you read a bit of history on how japanese invaded it in WW2, n all related stories surrounding it before visiting..I heard diplomat hotel was later burnt n so many died from a folk here,but couldn't find it in google  share if u know...ps.Don't wryy you can still sleep well at Night🤭🤗"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Not for the faint of heart, the history behind it is quite sad so it would be nice to drop by and pay respects."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"You can't go inside the building, nice scenery and a haunted ambiance."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This eerie abandoned building with a dark history is said to be one of the most haunted places in the Philippines.One of the best attractions in Baguio City!
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Not worth the hype, at least not at the time of day and when I went. It was very crowded and the building was temporarily closed to walk around inside and get a more creepy feel for this haunted building.We managed to get several nice pictures outside and around the building, and you can have a glance inside some of the opened windows. Maybe a night time experience with a small crowd will make for a better experience, otherwise it was fairly lacking for the 20 minutes or so we spent there."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A very historic and quiet place. Been here twice already. It feels creepy and eerie everytime I go inside as the voices of other visitors slowly fades. However, this place is great for photo ops."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This was once a beautiful property. I have had the honors to work here in the 70’s and was then, the most gorgeous grounds establishment you’ve ever laid your eyes on. The attention to details, from the entrance all the way to the back, was class act!!! It’s sad to see this place deteriorate. I wish someone would bring it back to its old glory."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Creepy! Cold air coming from inside the place whilst the sun is shining outside. …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place is cold. If you like historical places, this is for you."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great place to have bonding with your family and friends.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I visited the place way back in 2017. The place was kinda normal to me, maybe it was because there were lots of people that time. The view was nice, though. I enjoyed my time while we were at the rooftop. I hope they could guard the place better to maintain the beauty of the place, because if I remember clearly, there's vandalism on some parts of the place."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A very nice place to go strolling and breath fresh air since the place is also surrounded by nature. Sometimes there are art exhibits held inside the hotel. It is quite creepy when there are only few visitors. But if there are a lot of people, the place gets very noisy. Go to the roofdeck to get a nice view of the city, and if you're lucky, and the weather is great, you will also see Mount St. Tomas and Mt. Cabuyao."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice hidden gem in Baguio. It's a breath of fresh air so to speak. Something to go to other than the usual go to places of Baguio
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Location: 🌟🌟🌟 Quite far from the city and the jeepney will only take you halfway. I suggest you take a taxi or bring a private car. Going out is also a problem because it's a secluded place and not many taxis will go up unless they are taking a passenger there. We had to walk for a bit in order to secure a taxi that will take us back to the city.Place: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 I mean it's a known ghosty area so expect eerie vibes from it haha. Quite cold on the downstairs area, but when we got to the rooftop, it was kind of humid. I didn't know why, considering the whole place was so foggy.I will definitely recommend this for those who are into these kinds of things. But be careful though, you might disturb those who are permanent residents there."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A must-visit place when you're in Baguio, as it has unparalleled views of the city especially during sunset. Just be careful when taking photos as you may end up capturing some eerie images. 🤫"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It is pretty but since we got to go there in morning, it is not that creepy. We had fun strolling here and I love every corner of it. The only thing that I didn't see was the restroom because there's a lot of people that time."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"When you like to have some goose bumps is  Baguio City, this is the place to go,  They say ghosts live here. But I didn't feel anything at all. It was just an old abandoned building overlooking the city. For me it's  a place to relax and feel the coldness of the place. There's a parking space and an entrance fee collected by the city government ."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great for walking and those who want to see historic ruins and garden.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Indeed, history with deep roots is difficult to eradicate. …More"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"You cannot enter the hotel itself because of safety issues I guess, now its only famous because of the horror stories.But nonetheless you can just take pictures outside.If you're going to visit this when you're in Baguio. Make it least in your priorities. Nothing much to do here"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I rated 5! I'm curious about knowing the unknown. It can be scary but I didn't see anything. 🤣 Maybe because it's morning and there's a lot of people visiting this place at that time. A structural heritage and best place for knowing the history behind what happened to the people who firstly live here. Hope the locals and government preserve the place for the next generation.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Spooky as they might say but very much visited …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Love the scary stories of this old abandoned building!✔️ - Parking Area❌ - Comfort Room😛😛😛😛😛 - Enjoyable⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Historical (w/goosebumps)           - Ambience ( scary )
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"(Visited last Nov 15, 2022) 10pesos entrance fee per head, only to find out that you can't enter the building.Not worth it to travel and visit until they open it onced again. Visited this place last 2019 with the same entrance fee, but we got to explore the whole area and loaf around the roof deck.Commuter Tip: You can visit this area via Taxi, but when you're ready to leave, you'll have to wait at the gate entrance for another taxi or try GrabTaxi (with an extra booking fee on top of meter fare)."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"You only get to walk around the house, the garden and the long walkway area. It is nice but can be done quickly. We did some photo ops and that was it. …More"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice place to discover... Eerie for some but I find the place great for seeing Baguio in a much better viewpoint.Quite difficult to go to for some dye to steep roads but it's a great ride :)
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Still a great tourist spot! Diplomat Hotel …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Old Diplomat a.k.a ""The Silent Hill"" looks like, especially when the place is foggy.. Perfect for pictorial activities.. Oh by the way, it has also a stunning view of some part in baguio city when you go through to the roof top.. #BoyBagito"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This place is more of a historical structure for me, not that creepy and haunted hotel some people were saying. You can see rooms where guests used to accommodate, fountains (not working and surprisingly, working) and souvenir shop. Above. You can see the lovely view of Baguio. I wish they could bring this building back to life."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Come and visit this place if you need to relax your self from stressful work. I assured you that you can get what you want!!! What are you waiting for? Hurry up!!!
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Somehow gives me creeps. Doors and windows are almost barricaded. An eerie feeling is what you get when looking into its windows. …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It's an old historical delapidated building. That's it. The drive going there adds a little bit of a thrill.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Wasn't able to go inside as it's not allowed when we went there. They blocked the entry way. It was creepy. There were a lot of people. Even so a couple doing prenup.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This is our #1 priority attraction from Baguio. The view is good!  Can give you panorama view of Baguio and it was less creepy unlike those documentary videos you've watch. It was worth it.  Very very worth it to visit.  👌👌👌👌
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,When we went here It’s close to public for a bit of rehabilitation. I hope the next time we came here we can explore the inside. You can take photo’s outside tho while it’s close to public
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Good to drop by and learn its history. The cold and fog certainly adds extra spooky points.Ample parking.Property is now government-owned so both police and military serve as guards.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We really had a good time when we went to Diplomat Hotel. It is a heritage site to behold. The architectural design of the place is fantastic even if you can onlg see the ruins. When you walk along the corridors, it is like you are walking back to time. My first thought was that we are gonna have goosebumps but when we went there, we did not feel anything extraordinary but we felt so amazed. It is open to the public at 6 am until 6 pm. You can bring snacks with you (but you should know how to put your trash on the proper garbage bins). If you wanted to eat, there is also the Hive just beside the old hotel."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I love the views from the rooftop… It’s scanty because of the pandemic.. quite lonely but it’s a beautiful place for views and pictures. Entrance is php10 for adult and php5 for kids
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice to explore. Not scary as I thought. With the right shot  many corners are insta-worthy.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Nice place..but when we went here, the building was temporary close. Will be back here again."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Although we did not have the opportunity to go inside, we were able to enjoy ourselves outside. This is how you appreciate what you have in life, and we are all grateful for it."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"They say its a creepy place since lots of people lost their lives there. For me, it's merely connecting to our past. While going around the place I keep thinking of how the early generations lived and lost their lives there. Thumbs up to their local government for preserving this ruins in order for the new generations to have a glimpse of the past. 👍👍👍"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I love Baguio,so cool to be there,and the cold breeze of air and foggy weather is awesome,😍Heritage hill and nature are also great for relaxing and peace of mind."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This place is really historical imagining the history behind this hotel where it served as a refuge during World War 2. It's amazing how the walls are still standing and withheld the test of time. The place is at the very end of Dominican hill in Baguio. There are many tourists coming in so no need to be afraid
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,We only have an access outside the site but still we enjoy the place ans the view.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Not all taxi driver know the area, closed this time ( not allow to roam on building) but accept entrance fee at gate, only outside of building"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It's a nice historical place but it needs restoration
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Hard to go, not so scary or non-haunted place. Full of jejemon(fake hypebeast) or high school kids and weird christmas decorations. I really don't appreciate this place. This place doesn't look like haunted building. I just wasted my time there. I really don't recommend this place. 1 star for the view that you can find everywhere in baguio."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We went here during the day and it was a nice place to stroll around. The thing that made it less eerie was all the junk that were lying on the floor like paroles, signages, and other junk. I wish they kept the place as natural asit was."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I've been here twice when I was just in high school. Theirs a lot of improvements in this hotel and also the name was recently change. The garden beside the building is quite a fantasy. It has a variety of plants and colorful flowers. The place was improving its like they are actually reviving the Hotel. Some pictures of the Hotel was hang on the wall so other people can read the history of this place. And my instincts tell me there is a big tunnel under the Hotel. I still believe that this hotel still holds the secrets of the history of the past. Because from what I know this Hotel was a home from a wealthy family up until it became a church then a hospital and becoming a hotel later on. Being a tourist in this place, you'll expect that something weird you'll see or hear scary noise. And some other cases you might smell some nasty stuff. And that means you might be experiencing a paranormal activity. I'll visit again soon to check on this matter."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This is in Baguio, a city where I grew up. This place is part of my childhood. Located amidst trees and top of a hill, this used to be a church then a hotel. Spooky they say it is now a prayer mountain and a tourist spot. Today you still get the eerie when visiting the place. Old stories about being a haunted place still echoes in the city. Good for pictorials too."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Visiting the Diplomat Hotel was on the top of our list and we won't miss it for anything, mainly because of the history of the Hotel and grounds, the death and chaos that surrounds the hotel during the war. Getting in and out of the hotel is not a problem if you have access to the internet and could book a Grab taxi, its quite secluded and no taxis will passed by the hotel, you might need to walk downhill before getting a ride back to the city. We went around the hotel and took some photos first, with the creepy windows and garden, I really enjoyed onld houses and architectural design such as this one. We went at the roof top and waited for quite some time, hoping to catch the sunset but before the sun gone down the guard already asked everyone to leave the hotel, we were the last one to leave the rooftop and when we reached the second level going to the ground the door is already locked and we are trapped, starting to panic since its getting really dark and we are the only ones inside we tried to catch the attention of some visitors that are still outside and the called the guard and finally we got out. We stayed for a while and chat with the guard while waiting for our grab taxi, the guard is really nice and he was  telling us a lot of stories about the place, and they actually dont stay at the hotel, and the reason why they close early is probably because of the huntings. They stayed at the guardhouse by the gate which is very far from the actual hotel and they still hear noises comming from the hotel and still sometimes hear knocking at their guardhouse door. We wanted to stay until night time but it isnt allowed, but he told us that we could stay for the night if we get a permit, some were actually staying for the night and camp at the rooftop with a permit, I dont know how or where to get a permit. There is a toilet and washroom outside the hotel, there is also a spacious parking space."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This was part of my Baguio trip itinerary. They said that this old Diplomat Hotel is considered one of the most haunted places here in the country, to really check if it is true I went there to see it for myself. The ruins of this hotel is now a heritage and nature park, you can see pictures of people who once suffered the harsh punishments during the war, prisoners of war being housed in that place. It was a place of suffering. The place was not maintained well, there was water on the ground floor, it was dripping from the upper level. Some of the stairs are not passable (due to the weak foundation) I hope that they will still maintain the place. It was a very sad and eerie place for me, the remnant of the old world, still standing amidst it's dilapidated state. You can visit the place and see the view on the upper floor (fourth level)... Since I am not from Baguio, ( I am residing in Mindanao) I rented a taxi for 2,000php for six hours, it brought me to different Baguio iconic places, and this Diplomat Hotel is part of that list."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I am a local and I must say that this place still gives me the creeps whenever I go here. Too bad that on my most recent visit, it was too crowded already. Maybe because of the influx of tourist going to Baguio.Nonetheless, if you are looking for a picture perfect memory here in Baguio, Diplomat Hotel is a must visit.Follow me on Instagram:@LimitlessFirstpectiveFacebook Page:LimitlessFirstpectiveYT: Joey Nacario Vlogs"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Nothing scary. Must visit place in Baguio to satisfy your curiousity ☺️ Still, the building is old already so one must take extra precaution when shooting photos ."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice place to visit... its historical place..Before its a dominican rest and retreat house then for the refugee and turn to a hotel.. now its historical place you should visit. Open 6am-6pm. Its not that scary place.. more like historical site
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I can't believe I get to take a photo of the place myself. I used to look at the photos from the internet but now I have taken shots of this famous place by myself and I loved it! It's creepy knowing it's history but I loved it!
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Highly recommended for history lovers. This place is creepy. Instagram worthy 😁. The place is secured because it has security roaming around. Not recommended for kids. There are available tables and chairs at the ground floor, you can use it if you bring food with you. Just make sure not to leave trash after. Ghost might get mad."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,A beautiful historical building with a horror or scary vibe - sadly can't enter anymore due to some circumstances. People come here to make the church as tiktok backgrounds so maybe you tiktokers can hit the ney ney here and whip it real good. View of the mountain was 👌 …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It was nice, the creepy feels are still there. Too bas we were not able to see the art galleries. No idea why most of the displays are gone"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Revisited the hotel during the pandemic and it hits different with no tourists bustling along with you. The air is colder and it's like someone's always looking from your back. Haha.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,You’re no longer allowed in the building anymore. So it’s pointless to go there. So pointless. …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Diplomat hotel one of recommended place to visit in baguio  but at this time you are not allowed to visit inside the building but still hoping to visit after restoration. The largest Ten Commandments is found here it is proven by guinness world record on 2011
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It's a haunted hotel they say. It looks like an abandoned place, you can see from its interiors. Some parts are undergoing renovation already. No entrance fee for this place."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Basically an old burned up building. Went there at about 4pm and it closes at 5pm lol. It looked nice but you not gonna be the only one there.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great scenery in taking photos to remember.  💚❤💜
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This building should retain its history but not sure what happened why it looked like it became an art exhibit. I do love art but it should be in a proper place. The place has been known for his haunting stories and it would have retain its appeal if not because of the paintings. It looked like it was vandalised but on a good way.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It is not about the ghost, Old Diplomat Hotel is about our rich history and looking back about the suffering happened in the past. It was all written in our history. We may not have  contribution in the past, but remembering the souls of those unknown can help them to live at peace in the next life. Let's value the life offered here."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The Old Diplomat Hotel and used to be a Dominican Seminary. Rich with history and ghost stories. They have renovated the place already and now it looks livelier. The top of the building is good for 360° view of Baguio. Just don't forget to make ""pagpag"" after visiting this place. Lol"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This is a cool historical place. It's a bit creepy but if you're like me who's a bit excited about the creepiness of such a place this will be a good one. Not just the creepiness who will just attract you to visit the place but also the history behind it. And if you will have the chance to go upstairs it will give you an awesome view of Baguio City.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We went here to take some photos around 5pm, and this place is creepy. When you enter the main door a few steps you would feel that someone is watching you. There is only one main light inside. Recommended for ghost hunting activity and guys if you want a to have a scary experience I recommend that you visit this place. This place is open from 6AM to 6PM."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This place is amazing another good place to visit when you're in Baguio.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"They say it's one of the haunted place in Baguio City the reason I was very curious to visit. But since everyone heard about it, a lot of people are already flocking the area especially on weekends and holidays. I did not see any ghosts, however, I enjoyed the tour because of its rich history and architecture. A must visit for old stuff enthusiasts."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Its so cool place hahah
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I love the view and the vibe of the place
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Not worth going!! Don’t waste your time here! Half the park is fenced off by the groundskeepers. Not sure if they just made the back house their residence or what? …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The building  still standing but they're not allowing people to get inside the building.. pay parkint lang babayaran..
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I love the story behind this old diplomat hotel
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Cool! Very busy site... Got a good view of baguio
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Lots of tourists lately. You can't feel the ""scary vibe"" inside no more unless you go at night 😉 Still no entrance fees so it's a go-to place for backpackers."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Building is temporarily closed for renovations. If you're wondering there are no food stalls, but you can bring your own food, and there's comfort rooms too!"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"As soon as you enter the gate, there's this vibes that would tell you it's haunted. I wasn't that scared too much since there were a lot of people when we came but I can tell that some rooms had creepy vibes. We roamed all over the place and the building was very old as hell lol. Each rooms has it's own story to tell. I suggest going there past 4PM if you want to give your visit a thrill. 💀"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A historical place/building.Rich in story.In the morning or afternoon, it's not that scary. It's look like a place for overlooking or meditation.On the right side when you fronting the lobby, it is closed and renovated exclusive for meetings etc etc.On the left side, that's the place where you can start a short walk up to the roof top.Too many rooms to explore.No entrance fee.They have a parking area.6am-6pm"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Eerie and beautiful. This place offers a nice view of Baguio City as well. Explore the area and go into each nook and cranny.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice place to visit. Overview of the capital. Free entrance. Free parking.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A great historical place, well maintain and well protected, quite and clean, should not missed this place if your visiting Baguio."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Also called the Diplomat Hotel. Previously an old church seminary, camp during the war,  then a converted hotel, and now a haunted (?) or heritage building of the city. An old ruin with some partial renovations. A good 360° view of Baguio City. Entrance is free."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The place is still amazing tho visitor's are not allowed to enter the building anymore. :(
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Main building is currently closed due to falling debris and you only get to see the outside part of it.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Spooky and cold.. nice exploration for this historical haunted building.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,You can't enter but it's good to experience it if you haven't.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,creepy tho great view on the rooftop IG worthy
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Free entrance and good for picture taking, although expect lots of photobombers. If you fascinate abandoned places,  this is a must-go. I just wish the history of the place were written somewhere so guests will have an idea."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Nice place, creepy, but people love to take photo"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The rooftop view is pretty good and the history of the place is quite interesting. Not spooky enough imo.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This is one of the tourist attraction in baguio. One can ride a jeep or taxi to get to the place.   Aside from the old diplomat hotel and its horror stories, you can also find the big 10 commandments and ark of the covenant.It is best to visit in the early in the morning or late in the afternoon. The guard is also very accomodating and tells you stories of the place."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Got nice view of the old building. A bit creepy  but full of history.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Scary but super enjoy
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The view is scenic and panoramic. There are a lot of pine trees so it is a nice place to relax. You can view the city proper from the top of the old building. At the top you can see the beauty of it's former glory. You can see a lot of tourist coming in. It is accessible thru taxi transport and jeepneys(just one ride from city proper) . I bring my friends and they are amazed by it's view.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The fog adds scariness to it. Did got some unusual feelings though at the first few minutes in the ""hotel"", the climate was very low yet i was sweating as hell😖"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Old diplomat hotel. Nice place to visit …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,When you went to Baguio you should try to visit it. It can give you thrills in visiting it.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The place doesn't have an entrance fee and there's available parking space both inside and outside of the area. The place is not really that special because it wasn't maintained properly as well. Just the wishing well ia nice.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Beautiful place. Great view! It's ironic that the most haunted and the most scary place in Baguio has the most beautiful view! 360 degrees of Baguio is what you can see once you get to the roof deck. (I think this is the coldest place too, the fog adds to the eerie-ness of the place) 100% recommend, must see!"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"this place is so beautiful in the morning but creepy at the afternoon, perfect location for photo shoots :) and there's no entrance fee once you visit the historical diplomat hotel the only thing you do is to log your name when you enter , one of my favorite places in Baguio."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The Dominican Hill Retreat House, also commonly known as the Diplomat Hotel, is an abandoned structure atop Dominican Hill, Baguio, Philippines. It is now undergoing rehabilitation through the efforts of the city government."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Went here a few years ago. The Building has probably witnessed so many tragic events that one can feel how sad the place is.Something weird happened here also, my friend took pics here of us and 2 pics turned out distorted! First time to witness and see those kind of pictures in my life. Place also Scary as if someone watching you."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"2nd time being here last Oct. 27, 2019. Love to take pictures, it is open until 5pm."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,eery yet scenic place. i felt the goosebumps.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Clean area and security guard is entertaining
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great for photo ops enthusiast whether a beginner or pro.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"An eerily beautiful building located in Baguio City. It has an entrance fee of ₱10 and parking charges. As of writing this review, people aren't still allowed to enter the building due to falling debris, but the place is still worth the visit!"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Spooky at first, but you'll feel the history of that place. Just don't think about anything since that place is crowded until past afternoon."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great place.. preserved historic building
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It wasn't spooky, nice ruins though. I can totally imagine what it could have been if they continued it"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"You'll hear a lot of scary stories about this place so I really don't want to visit this place but when we arrived here, there are a lot of tourist roaming the whole place! The whole place is rich in history and you'll be in shock knowing what really happened to some people during the Japanese occupation in the country."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I love Diplomat Hotel! Im glad that its open to public for free. Perfect place to shoot.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Get your own goosebumps 😁👌🏻
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It will make you curious to visit with the history and ghost story this place holds.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Unforgetable Tourists' spot in Baguio City.... indeed mystical
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Its nice to visit
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,A very beautiful place though not well maintained. Hopefully they could remove the parapernalies from festival because it looks like a warehouse..
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Not advisable to visit if you are easily scared. We didn't go inside because it is prohibited when we visit.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,One of the well known tourist spots in Baguio. Place now have different paintings for attraction.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,A building with a historical background and now infamous for being one of the most haunted places in Philippines.A must visit if in Baguio city.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,3 stars to give way to improvements especially proper preservation of historical buildings and other artifacts. …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Eerie yet beautiful abandoned structure worth visiting for... Great view atop Dominican Hill Baguio.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Explore the old Diplomat hotel with its picturesque facade but don't let your imagination run wild!
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Open for public but the inside of the building itself is not Open. You can only take pictures outside.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"OLD BUILDING, CANNOT ENTER INSIDE. VERY HISTORICAL"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Good place to see more of Baguio. Kinda give you chills when you went up to the second floor. Haha
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"My family and I have a great time exploring this place. I love the greenery, the flowers, the butterflies. The hotel ruins bring a chill to the atmosphere.😁"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Thought it would be scarier,  but not.  Any way,  my boyfriend and I enjoyed the view😊"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Majestic and educational. These are the two words that can describe this place. I really loved the way they restored and enhanced some parts of the hotel. Kudos to all of the management and to the City of Baguio.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The review is for the Old Diplomat Hotel. OK to visit just once. It takes just about 5 mins to go around the area and that’s it. To be fair, entrance and parking fee is cheap. P5 for adults, children are free, parking at p35.The building is, well, old and dilapidated and I guess has the haunted house charm.  To be fair, the area is kept clean - it doesn’t smell like pee and you won’t see pop lying around.The surroundings of the building are very much alive with trees, flowers and greenery.If you’re pressed for time on your visit to Baguio - not a place I would recommend to see because really, there isn’t much to see 😄"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Cool place (literally). It's good but not maintained properly. Also, no functioning comfort room when I went there."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Historic building, quite spooky , creepy 👻"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice old place
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A must go place for people who love horror and mystery. Easy to find a taxi to take you there, but you have to be patient to wait for a taxi that will take you back to the city."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Very historic and creepy place to visit in Baguio. A good place to visit if you want to see Baguio City top view
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Not much to see here, went Feb '19 and no art installations, just a packed dilapidated building. Garden outside was ok, views from this height are great though."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,imagining how magnificent this place is before.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Very beautiful place despite its eerie history, too bad the indoors are temporarily off limits to visitors due to the damage caused by typhoon Maring. There's no entrance fee before but now you have to pay but only for a small price (which I hope they will use to maintain and retrofit the area). You can still stroll the graden area and take pictures with beatiful nature views."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Better coming here as a group with private car as commuting going back to city proper is a challenge.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This place has become a joke already. When this place was virtually unknown to the outsiders in the 90's, it was a mystery and really spooky.   But now, it is just another tourist trap."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,limited touring space.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This place actually is not scary, but it is a very beautiful place."

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place is clean but if you are a sensitive person, beware of the roaming souls and creepy feeling."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This is part of the Baguio history. We went there to check out Ibagiw fedtival and they managed to make the place look really good. A lot of people were there and it didnt look scary, mystic! Yes!"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,We went there last February. I did not enjoy because it was overcrowded. We will surely comeback there to experience the creepiness 🤣🤣🤣

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Really forward to see something
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,An old and abandoned building. Nothing special.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,An old and abandoned hotel that is just it. With entrace fee of 10 pesos
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Good place to kill time with friends.Spacious parking with minimal fee.Very good ambiance.

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It still has its creeps but the number of tourists visiting the place plus the ₱10 ticket pass made it a friendly place to reminisce the ghostly stories in its history. Instagramable!Few reminders:- To those who are commuting, your in and out is taxi only.- 15-30 mins from the city proper."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,View from old Diplomat Hotel ruin.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice views from there. A long one hour walk from Baguio center.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Currently the building is close... there are renovations on going. Still creepy though..
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Famous for its scarry stories but this hotel ain't that creepy at all.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Very historical
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I've been to Baguio City umpteen times but it was my first time to visit Diplomat Hotel with my officemates for a weekend getaway last December 8, 2018. It's an abandoned place, a bit creepy in  some areas but it offers some historical knowledge. Go for it, it's worth your time"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,a nice place to see the old buildings still standing
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It's interesting to see, but I would have liked more information for tourists about what the building is and why people believe it's haunted"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Mini park behind Diplomat Hotel.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"As of December 28, 2021. You cannot enter the inside of the Hotel."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Good weather you see big stone tablet 10 commad of god...
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A spooky experience, very fun experience specially with friends, and the top has an amazing view  of the city!"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nothing much to do here. It's doesn't have that spooky or haunted vibes.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Its creepy, you can't enter inside the building"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,glimpse of the past... hopefully maintain ang inside structure ng place
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Deifinitely the rich history of the structure will capture your curiosity.  One of the best place to get a beautiful look at the scenic landscape of baguio.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Creepy place
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,A good place to reminisce our past. A must for history buffs.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Been here last November 2017. One of the must-visit spots in Baguio City.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Not that haunted because a lot of people/tourist passing by and there's an ongoing renovation
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Nothing unusual about the place, has a good viewing deck, sadly weren't able to go inside since its prohibited"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A little creepy, but overflowing with history... You can feel the ghost of the past and war here"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place is normally closed to the public after 4:30 PM. But we were able to enter the building as part of the Pine City Fright Tours. It was our last stop. As it is, the place is already scary as hell at night. But learning about its history made it so much more frightening. It was thrilling but I'm not sure it is something I'd like to do again."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I had the chance of going there while there was a painting and photo expo + a lyric singing concert! The atmosphere was amazing!The house in itself is pretty impressive also. So go there! You never know what you might stumble upon :)
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Scaring? No.. more or historical...
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A historic site. Has a nice view of the city.  Roof access no longer available as of this writing. Possibly for safety reasons. Views would have been better there. Site and building could use better maintenance and upkeep. ""Strategic"" restoration of certain sections would be awesome, making the site last longer and look a lot better."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Awesome place to visit, better than expected"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,its good to be here
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This place lives up to its name: heritage. There's a different feeling when you get there. It's creepy and at the same time amazing because it takes you back in time when you still do not exist. The historical photos displayed inside are really awesome.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Best place to walk.I used to walk there from home every Friday morning and stayed there a whole day.Although it get 2hours to walk from home to get in this place, but after that it's worth it.It's a beautiful place. Peaceful. Out from this air pollution from the car in the city.Very nice place."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Its a old hotel in late 90's turned into a tourist spot in Baguio.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,You cannot enter the hotel anymore. …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Jampacked with tourists but the place is really nice.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A haunted hotel in Baguio,"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place is hauntingly beautiful but the tourists are really a turn-off. They have been told not to stand on high ledges and yet, they still do it. The entrance is free and you can get great photos! Another thing we noticed are the vandalism on some walls. I hated the EJK signs because, cmon, even here?!"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A must go tourist destination. Feel the chilling vibe of the old diplomat hotel. According to sayings, this place is haunted. Place is not crowded. Securities are present within the area. The view is overlooking some place in Baguio City. Unfortunately building is not well maintained and damages can be seen in the structure which add to its haunted vibe"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Not that scary as says in news and some people. I'm looking for a ghost but i saw nothing. I think it is because of the renovation of the place. This place is good for photoshoot. I hope it can bring back the scary feeling of the hotel when I go back to this place. Great tourist attraction. Thumbs up for this👍👍
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nothing special but an old ruined building
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The building is temporary closed. Entrance fee should've been free since the main attraction is not really accessible.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Definitely worth to visit! The view is really nice. We walked from the intersection to the diplomat. The road was elevated so it can be quite tiring.  Didn't see anything tho, but you can feel the heaviness upon entering the place. Can't quite explain it 😅"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,10 Pesos Entrance and 35 pesos for Parking.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,closed. you can only view from the outside window.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Best to visit 2pm-4pm before it closes.  Better to visit also during lean days para you can enjoy the creeps of being alone.  Lol
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great architecture on top of a hill. You'll have goosebumps once you get in.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"An abandoned seminary school built in 1913, it is also called Diplomat Heritage Hill and Nature Park. It was converted into hotel by Diplomat Hotel in 1973 but closed when its manager/owner died. The roofdeck of the building provides a 360 degree view on Baguio City. A great place for reconnecting with Baguio's history and lots of photo ops for photography buffs. Paranormals believe to be  a haunted place due to its brural past during World War II. But you got to find out for yourself."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Really appreciate the structure of the building.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place has changed so much since I've last been here.Gone was the creepy, foreboding and gloomy Heritage hotel. They host events and extremely remodeled the place that the hotel no longer offers the thrill.All you can do now, is drop by and take some pictures. Too many tourists drop by now and I think they all scared the ghosts away. Hehe"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,We were not able to go inside the bldg. Said they have restricted it because the structure already has a weak foundation and might cause unwanted accidents.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We visited the place on a night time. We joined the security on their rounds. The inside had a still air. We took some pictures and they showed images rarely found in a normal picture. There were children, nuns and a friar in the photos we took. Or these were just products of our imagination."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Quite crowded in the morning. Due to the volume of people, the ambience of the supposed to be creepy place was gone,. Maybe the place will be different by afternoon or evening. Will go back to check on a different time. Nonetheless, the place is beautiful. The view from the top is amazing."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Scary Diplomat Hotel at night …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,just an old bldg with nature. nothing so special
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Pretty much an old building where a lot of young people have photo shoots 😂 I enjoyed reading a little about it’s history however it would be great if there were guided tours or even ghost tours around this place. The roof of the building has great view of the whole city so that was pretty much the best part of my visit.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Interesting place. We've just visited awhile ago at around 5pm and there's not much people, we'd taken pics as much as we want."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Weekdays, best day to visit the place to enjoy the arts and ambiance :)"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Added a hint of wxcitement to our baguio trip. The place is apooky and will give you the creeps
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,See different kinds of house here.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,you can see beautiful view from the top of the building:)
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Would be such a lovely place if it did not suffer from poor maintenance and sanitation. There is a strong smell of urine every where you walk in the building. The structural steel supports in the concrete suspending the 1st floor is rusted and subject to structural failure. I saw the exposed steel and left the building.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Although the dilapidated state of the building brings in that haunted vibe to which this historical site is known for, it would be nicer if there is ""life"" added to this historical place. Still a good place to visit for those who wants to know more about the history of baguio or for those who wants to feel the ""hauntedness"" of the place."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Amazing place to tour around
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A heritage place that has great potential to teach history, but the historical content of the structure need to be searched, collected, and curated. The government oversees, but it is apparent rebuilding and maintenance need funding. Hoping here for benevolence and public support."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Interesting place to visit, the history about it is very extensive with many strange and horrid happenings. Currently in a restoration phase which is great."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Just ordenary old hotel , nothing to do aside from that just the history itself."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I LOVED IT REALLY. So many spots where u can take pictures to post in ig. Im an aesthetic and meticulous instagram narcissist and I assure you that it is recommended. Especially to those who wants vintage and dark feeds. You can roam around the ruins of the hotel and the garden. Gosh i loved it there. I would have given four stars because we exhausted ourselves getting there since we went by foot but nah, I considered the place in general."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This place deteriorated from the last time I visited it around 2 years ago. What's new are the art pieces on some of the walls that looks out of place.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It's been a long time since i last visited this place..
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The only thing that I like about diplomat is the exterior design (plus the windows.) They're renovating I think half of the building which flooded some of the rooms. It is famous for its scary stories and people being possessed, maybe that's why a lot of people go there? Ps. It is so hard to take pictures without photobomber🤫"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Awesome
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The place is not that scary but haunting. Efforts are already been placed for the repairs of the building
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,At the moment you can't enter the hotel …More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We had so much fun there. Someone said to me that once you go visit  the diplomat hotel, some spirits or ghost will follow you, haha but that's not true. The place has so many nice spots to take pictures."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Creepy
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Now the newest art hub in the city. Come and commune with nature or just admire the art works on display for the First Baguio Creative Festival. You'll enjoy yourself either imagining things that you think you saw or just taking in the sights.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Creepy it is but there's more of a horror stories about this hotel.

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,We are not allowed entry inside. 😭
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Considered as one of the most haunted place in the country. Yeah! I'm convinced. I saw a white misty figure coming out from the main entrance. I wasn't frightened but amazed. 😮👻🏚️

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great experience to visit Diplomat Hotel. Not scarry since we visited at around 9 or 10 am and a lot of people there were exploring the place

We should all pray for the souls that rested here."

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Its a quiet yet  eerie place...visit on weekdays because not alot of people visit the place but they do visit on weekdays and the place would be crowded.you need to have a car or rent a taxi because the place is out of jeepney lines and they wont bring you directly at the hotel,you will have to walk the rest if that is the case but if you rent a taxi you dont have to walk."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Love this place very serene
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Diplomat Hotel, as it's most popularly called, is known for its derelict appearance and ghost stories. In recent years, the city government has made efforts to improve it and develop it as a heritage site, complete with art exhibits and useful historical facts. However, with each new enhancement, the place becomes more and more an actual hotel, slowly shedding off its source of infamy."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I like the old ruins and the view on top
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,One of the heritage places in baguio you must visit

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Good for take photos
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"You'll see ruins and where the baguio lgu store their giant christmas decor. Btw, it's not easy to leave the place unless you use grab taxi which is for me is very pricey. We walked out ans down until we saw a jeep going to baguio plaza."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It's a good place to visit and really gives you the creeps but it also gives you a historical sense which is really good
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Most people go here with the objective of finding ghosts. There are so many people who go here so it isn't as eerie as you expect it to be. Maybe visit during rainy days or foggy days for the full experience?
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Best place you can go in Baguio
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great for ghost hunting😨😨😨

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The Old Diplomat HotelThe very well known to be one of the most haunted place in the Philippines. Located in city of Baguio or known as summer capital of the Philippines.It used to be a vacation house and a seminary way before it was developed into a school and eventually, a hotel.According to some residents in the area and caretaker, there are the spirits of nuns and priests who were beheaded during the war. Exploring its quiet and gloomy passages will give you chills and goosebumps.#olddiplomathotel #revisiting #baguio #travelthrowback #haunted #abandoned #fountain #travelph #travelphotography #gopro #photoofthedayFollow IG: jay291350"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This building is truly beautiful. The structure and it’s architectural design is really interesting. You can still see the old bricks and still feel the coldness inside.I would love to stay longer but due to the massive number of tourist visiting the level of excitement went down, it’s pretty sad that they’re everywhere shouting and running here and there.I think the best time to visit the place is around 8am it’s solemn and for sure you will enjoy the calmness of the Diplomat Hotel."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A bit scary place, much creepy. Some part of the building has nasty smell though."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"... The place is maintained,  though there are some rooms filled with debris. The second floor is closed and under renovation.  All and all good for it's very historical..."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"If you like historical places, go here. Is it haunted? I think not. Located near Lourdes Grotto, so might as well make another stop here."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Not really much to see other than very dilapidated building  that has been patched up with various shoddy brickwork. It's location at the top of Dominican Hill overs a great view of surrounding Baguio City though.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Lot of unnecessary drawings and writings on the wall. Hope the local govt here will still restore the history on that place
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Seeking some adventure visit this place.🙂
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The place is peaceful. You can climb at the roof top of the old hotel and enjoy the scenic view of Baguio city.

On rainy days the floors become super slick, so watch your step. I give this place maybe 10 more years before it crumbles"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Diplomat Hotel has really good view. Though a bit creepy but still an amazing place.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The calmness is what took our breaths away in this beautiful place in the heart of Baguio...A perfect place for your family and friends to relax and enjoy nature at its finest...
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Its an abandoned hotel. nothing special there is some kind of a art as well.

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I expected to see or experience the ghost with us, but it never happen. i wanna come again. great view at the top."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This is one of our favorite places to visit in Baguio. There's no entrance fee and although it is not pretty accessible from the city via commute (less you opt to ride a jeepney then walk some five minutes instead of hailing a cab or bringing a car), it's an amazing spot to see fog and pine trees on top of the infrastructure ruins (hopefully not some ghosts)."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place was renovated, they added a glimpse of the history of the place. The largest tablet of the ten commandments is also located here."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,love the view and chilling experience.

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The ruins of the old retreat place is really eerie but still you feel a solemn vibe overall

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"When I found out that we will be going to the Old Diplomat Hotel I really got excited. I just love visiting old historical places. And this building intrigue me from the stories I heard.This hotel sits on top of the Dominican Hill with a panoramic view overflooking the city of Baguio. There are a lot of tourist when we got there. I believe this place is the first on their list when they visit Baguio.Inspite of the stories I heard I was more fascinated than scared because the hotel is beautiful even in ruins and decay.  I find the atmosphere of this abandoned place fascinating and delightful.  I felt going back in time imagining  about the people who used to walk through that halls and slept in the now empty rooms. I imagined how beautiful and grand it was during that time.Most of all the place is really good for photo shoot. There  are a lot of spots inside the building such as broken windows, eerie  walls, and the famous fountains which makes a great backdrop. At  the rooftop you can have a photo overlooking the picturesque view of the place."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,A must visit in Baguio City. Food is available in the area for a minimal cost.

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,If your looking for something different the Diplomat Hotel is worth checking out. It's known to be one of the most Haunted places in Philippines and the day we decided to go planned out perfectly there was a very heavy fog that day so it made the hotel more creepy looking and just walking through it there was an eerie feel to it. I recommend it to be one of ur stops whenever ur in Baguio

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,too sad the entire building is no longer allowed for people to enter
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Wasn't allowed to go inside so we just took strolls around the vicinity. The garden and the scenery were nice.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Last 2019 was quite memorable for me because I finally got to visit one of places that I used to watch on paranormal shows and documentaries. It has a sad (and brutal) history, and to see the old, decrepit building in person was solemn and eerie; quite a contrast to the beautiful garden right outside.I've heard that there has been a few changes (or restrictions) since then, nevertheless, if you're in Baguio, this site is a must-see."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Not able to go inside anymore, was just relegated to going around the property"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A century ago, the Dominicans built a holiday and study home on a hill. The house, which had many vicissitudes during the war, was renovated into a 'Diplomat Hotel' after the war, an imposing building with a square plan.After a fire with the dead it was abandoned, in the smell of ghosts.Now, it is among the attractions that are managed by the municipality, with a beautiful garden.You pay a 10 peso ticket."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"When we went he was close I don't know why but the building is still the building and its beautiful as it is. We didn't just go inside, we were just outside taking pictures around the building. He has no entrance fee, he is free. He is also close to Lourdes Grotto, so it is also convenient to visit 2 tourist spots immediately."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It is forbidden to go inside due to falling debris. The climb is steep. It's okay to go in the afternoon when it's less crowded.Nothing special. It looks like a normal old building.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I hope it's ok if I can come in haha. We would have gone ghost hunting in case the building was closed and no entry was allowed. All tourists just outside. We paid for parking and entrance fee though
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The time we went there the building was closed. You cannot go inside the building because of falling debris. I hope they have a way to prevent this from happening so they can go inside.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The area is scary especially when it rains but it's still a best experience you must visit during baguio time .. BOOK NOW Highly recommended @Lakbay Tourismo Travel and Tours
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The place is clean and the entrance is affordable. P10 for parking and P10 pesos for entrance. Although you can't go inside anymore. You can only take pictures outside.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The view is beautiful. When we went, it wasn't open. The hotel diplomat was not allowed to enter the building. Someone was throwing rocks."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The building is now closed but you can still enter the vicinity. Make sure when you go up and you don't want to walk down, you have a car"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,not much to see. it is forbidden to enter the ooob
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,One of the places you have to visit when you are in Baguio. It is often used in shows and movies that are scary. M
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"😇😍It's scary being alone here hahahah, this place is also beautiful"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"As of June 2022, it is no longer possible to enter the interior due to falling debris. You can only go around outside and in the garden."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It can only be viewed from the outside, so it's worth going for a walk. Go if you have a lot of time. It's not worth going."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This place feels heavy. A bit eerie and creepy. The place is well guarded and has a fully functional cr. The parking space is also ok.You can bring pets like chihuahua but not the big dogs.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Idk but this is my fav place in Baguio because the view here is perfect. Feeling european. haha
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"There really is a ghost.,. But if you put your fear before going there, you will be really scared and you will feel their presence.,. But if you go there, just think that the diplomat is like this and don't think if there is a ghost watching or not.,.There were some changes when we went last time.,. The photos of the monks and nuns were removed from a corner of the hotel.,. It was the second time I went and I didn't feel that anyone was following or watching unlike the first time,.,.Careful maybe in taking a picture with the mindset that ""it's okay if there's a ghost to be photographed"" seems like a challenge,., Just take a normal picture like a vacationer.,.Every part of the hotel is beautifully photographed. Especially when it's foggy.. highly recommended for Baguio visitors"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Chill plus creepy vibes .. If you know history .. Hehe better go there in the afternoon for exciting haha
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Do not enter inside
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,There is no point in going here either. You can't go inside either. There are also no seats and hangouts. Even the theater is still closed.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place is beautiful! They say it's very scary, but it's very beautiful here at the Diplomat Hotel"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Very eerie feeling at Diplomat Hotel. When we went we were not allowed to go inside until we were just outside. 35 pesos is the parking fee and 10 pesos is the entrance fee (adults) and 5 pesos for children.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,CreepyliciousSolemn..nice view at the rooftop..the glass looks like there's a nun but of course that's just a mischievous imagination
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,No demons :((
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Fantastic nature path. Pine trees. Nice chill. Silence. Relaxation.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,nice and clean so the building itself is closed and I hope they can improve their CR but it's clean nmn
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"If you're looking for a place to scare yourself this is not the place, the ghosts have left and the crowds are crowded every day ... As of today they don't open and can enter right inside the hotel, you can round and paid I forgot howmuch ..."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A hotel built during the Spanish colonial days before 103, and a war broke out in this place between the two places and the Philippines on one side, and the Japanese on the other."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"very beautiful place, you climb on the rooftop very romantic view 😍"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"You are not allowed to go inside yet, but it looks like it is being renovated"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Amazing place, historical, pretty uplifting"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"My family enjoys the place, please visit me momo daw"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Only 2 stars because the ghost didn't show up
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Hmmm, a place the locals should visit"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Nice place, if it's closed, they're poor ghosts who come out to scare diplomats outside, because people are not allowed inside"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"First of all, the road to get here is a bit confusing especially if you use Waze or Google Maps. We were taken to a remote place but we also found the way to it. Just follow the road signs.Second, the place is beautiful and the scenery especially on the roof of the Dominican Hotel. You can't feel the vibes when there are a lot of people, especially during the holidays when people flock. Try to go during hindi holidays so you can feel the old vibes here.Lastly, you can learn not only about ghosts here. You can see important information and history here because there is information posted on the walls."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The view is beautiful.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I will come back when I have time 😅 nice...
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Under maintenance so not inserted inside. Bawi nalang next life.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,No entry :(

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Maganda dun. I just advise you to bring food hehe you will be hungry. Then it's delicious to eat there when overlooking. 😊
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I hope it's good here gabe aha, it's very nice, I hope the place can be preserved in order"

Tam-awan Village,"Reconstruction of traditional huts and showcasing Baguio arts/history. Nice and short hike trail especially for young people to get them starting, or a couple looking for fun time out. Some stairs or walkways missing handrails though."
Tam-awan Village,Place is a bit dark as there were alot of trees. Highlight of the attraction would be the paintings made by i believe people living there. There was quite of it and if you love paintings and a little bit of trecking you will enjoy the place. You can also buy items there as there is a souvenir shop inside as well as home made kitchen food.
Tam-awan Village,"If you're into nature tripping, this is the place for you to explore. Though, one has to be ready to take the challenge in climbing lots of stairs. Entrance fee is discounted for students and seniors and paid upon registration. There's a hut selling souvenirs, another hut if you want to have a sketch of yourself, another hut where you can have a tattoo. Lots of things to explore and do. But for seniors, take note to visit when its summer cause the stones and steps are slippery and not senior friendly. There's also a gallery featuring paintings of local talents."
Tam-awan Village,Been here before and it was not exactly what I remembered. I remembered more art pieces back then. More sculptures and huts. Also don't bring a stroller here you won't be able to use it. It will just be an added weight. It's a hike going here so be ready.
Tam-awan Village,One of the best tourist spot in Baguio! The place is kinda far from the city but super worth it. Though it's not kid and senior friendly because the stairs are too steep. The place is still perfect if you want to learn about Ifugaos.
Tam-awan Village,"Amazing views at the very top view deck, you can even see the new Igorot Stone Kingdom nearby. Can be quite challenging to climb some high steps throughout for the children and elderly, and some steps were slippery, but it's the closest to nature you can be without doing actual hiking. The cool air is also a plus."
Tam-awan Village,"This village is a blend of Arts and Baguio's Nature. Located at Pinsao Proper Baguio City, art and nature loving indivoduals will surely enjoy this new tourist spot in the City. Nearby tourist spot are the Igurot Stone Kingdom and the famouse Baguio Strawberry Farm"
Tam-awan Village,"When I first visited this place 10 years ago, there were lots of artworks to see. It really showcase what it was like for the indigenous igorots to live during their time. That's why I decided to take my kid this time around. I was disappointed. Very few artworks. The hike turned slippery and dangerous because of the drizzle we were experiencing that day. So we didn't do the full hike. We had to turn back and leave. It was a waste of entrance fee because we didn't see much. Also, there were people in costume if you want to take pictures with them for an additional fee. We tried to get in one of the huts to explore but there are 2 men (the one in costume) that was sleeping inside. So we felt like we were intruding. But this is supposed to be huts on display. I feel like they shouldn't be in there sleeping."
Tam-awan Village,"It's a small village, like a cultural village. There's a short trek, I believe its around 20-25 mins trek. you can also have a picture taken with staffs wearing an igorot costume."
Tam-awan Village,"If the culture or living conditions of people from this area are unknown to you, this place is a must place to visit..it is rather small but it showcases thr houses, terrain..additionally for me very tasty food in the cafe, well worth the price you pay...."
Tam-awan Village,This is such an amazing place! I love how they preserved the trees in this area amidst the busy city life to where it was strategically located. Be prepared for it is cold inside because of the big trees surrounding it.There is also a café inside and some artists who sketches impromptu if you want your own.Tam-awan Village is open daily from 8AM to 6PM including holidays. General Admission is ₱60 only.
Tam-awan Village,"The basic entrance fee is Php60 for adults, Php40 for students, and PhP30 for children below 10 years old. Children 3 years old and below may enter for free. The entrance fee is not worth it for the place.  There is no information about their culture, tradition. You will visit the place by your own with out explaining anything about the place."
Tam-awan Village,"Omg. Loved it.   The art work is amazing but the dancers were the highlight of my trip to Bagio.   (However,  my fiance was very quick to pull me away from the very handsome boys after the dance.)"
Tam-awan Village,The plants are beautiful but it can be seen that the heritage places or old things used by the Igorots in the past have been neglected and the path is not cleaned a bit slippery and dangerous for the elderly
Tam-awan Village,"Extremely disappointing. There is hardly any information around the site to describe anything you are looking at - you cannot learn much here. It’s just a place for taking photos (and not a very good place for that either). Also, the directional signage is really bad so it’s hard to know where you’re supposed to go."
Tam-awan Village,"First time to come here and I must say, anyone who comes to baguio should visit this culture-rich venue. Nature embraces the place and traditional stuff takes you back in time as if you experience the igorot's life first hand. Traditional dances performed were also a delight!"
Tam-awan Village,"They presserved their tradition very well especially the traditional dance. If you love art, you will surely fell inlove with their paintings."
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-Awan Village is a cultural and art hub built by local artists to showcase and preserve the heritage of Cordillera. It’s a must-have addition to your Baguio Trip and you will learn about the origins and culture of our fellow Igorots. Discover the way of life of the Igorots, and enthrall yourself in their vibrant lineage and heritage in this garden in the sky. If you’re going to Baguio City, make sure to include Tam-Awan Village in your itinerary."
Tam-awan Village,"When in Baguio :Visited the Tam-awan Village (meaning vantage point). Again, one must have good stamina to complete the tour. Beautiful culture and heritage."
Tam-awan Village,"One word I can say.. AMAZING. If only I can live on one of their huts, I will be contented forever in life. So peaceful and refreshing. I like buying all of those paintings and place it in my gallery room (if only I have a gallery room). So cool, really amazes me, and enchanting going up the wonderful hilly side as if going to heavens. 😊Best place I have been into"
Tam-awan Village,"This place is a bit different than most any other places I've been to or any other small villages of people of old. You'll want a good pair of hiking/walking-running shoes for this place since you'll be doing a lot of climbing and walking upstairs and downstairs and some of them can be quite slippery.It's doesn't take very long to visit this place. Maybe almost 2 hours and you can have a good tour of this village and what it has to offer. There's some nice pictures you can take and there's some staff who dress up as the tribe people and do a little ritual dance, which was fun to watch. The price wasn't a lot. I can't remember exactly but I remember it wasn't too much."
Tam-awan Village,It’s ok but not that exciting to go to. All you do there is just climb up a mini village
Tam-awan Village,Clean facilities.If you are an avid art enthusiast you will enjoy it here.
Tam-awan Village,"For a brief view of the Cordilleran culture, with mossy forest and fog thrillers..u can also buy paints arts"
Tam-awan Village,Great art work! Nice scenery. Pet friendly.
Tam-awan Village,A great visit for a quick learning of Baguio's past culture. Good for kids too.
Tam-awan Village,"Be prepared to climb up a trail leading to the top for a nice view of nature.  Wear your rubber shoes or any time of hiking boots for easier climb. I was wearing my flats and skirt and it was a bad idea, although manageable.  You will appreciate the culture of the locals for example what their houses looked like during their time. They also have a small souvenir shop to buy a little memorabilia with you and a cafe inside."
Tam-awan Village,Nice place. Be ready to hike those stairs. They also feature a local group of dancers with their cultural igorot dance. There is also a small restaurant where we were served a local delicacy called pinikpikan.
Tam-awan Village,Not the tam-awan village that i used to go before. Hopefully more things to do here.
Tam-awan Village,A perfect place for lovers! Especially for couples who are wishing to have a child.❤️📵 - Free Wi-Fi❌ - 24H✔️ - Body Temperature Checking✔️ - Well Maintained Area✔️ - Entrance Fee of 50.00PHP❌ - Parking Area✔️ - Food Stalls✔️ - Comfort Rooms⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Historical📸📸📸📸📸 - Instagrammable😊😊😊😊😊 - Enjoyable           - For Lovers & Family Bonding🌿🌿🌿🌿🌿 - Nature Tripping
Tam-awan Village,I've been here 4 years ago and I enjoyed my time here. The locals were nice and having a tour around the place made me glad because they were able to preserve their culture for the new generations to see. I heard that they have added some new attractions recently and I hope I could come back to visit again some time in the future.
Tam-awan Village,This place is a good place to know more about the life of native people in Benguet. There are guides who will tour you around the village. There is a few hike in view deck 2. The cafe is nice. I love their brewed coffee! Must try!
Tam-awan Village,"An amazing place for nature and art. The place is on a mountain where you can hike to different places like a dream catcher hut, spiritual hut and 2 view decks."
Tam-awan Village,Great showcase for Baguio artists. Artworks of various media enrich Filipinos' appreciation of own culture.  Let us support local artists by patronizing their works of art.
Tam-awan Village,"When you enter you pay a small fee. In my opinion it is so worth it. The fee helps with the up keep of the place. It's a small compound but feels like a big adventure inside. They feature small art galleries, restaurant and a viewing deck that's perfect for sunsets."
Tam-awan Village,Lot's of parked cars and hard to commute going back to burnham
Tam-awan Village,"Date of visit 2019 Dec 23.Time of visit 10.40 am to 12.50 pm.Sight Seeing 6.5.Transportation / Getting there 6.Ambience 8.Price PHP60/pax.Expected exploration time 1 to 2 hours.Sight Seeing: This is small sky jungle with a wishing well / pond, huts, dream catchers and hill top views. There is also a cafe inside. Great shots can be taken depending on your ingenuity with nature. The uphill climb has some slight risks, trek slowly and firmly on the muddy terrain, some rocks could be slippery and even dry terrain is dusty and flaky and is a slip hazard. Some parts of the trek do not have any railings to prevent an accidental downhill fall. Nevertheless, it is fairly simply uphill trek for elementary school kids with adequate caution. The only drawback is that this attraction is isolated, as compared to Camp John Hay or Mines View Park.Transportation: Transportation in Baguio for those without a private transport is either jeepney or taxi. The Jeepney begins the journey from Fairview Central Jeepney Terminal, Hilltop street. Then, it takes about 15 mins to reach Tam Awan Village.Ambience: The garden jungle provides just enough challenge for all ages. The air is fresh and clean as expected."
Tam-awan Village,Wear comfy shoes coz its a climb up. Really portrays how our native cordilleran brethren lives.
Tam-awan Village,Huge place. They will give you a map so you can guide yourselves when roaming inside. There's no too much difference compared to other landmarks in Baguio. It's like a combination of museums and view decks that were formed on the same area. It's still a cool place to go.
Tam-awan Village,It's a few tribal houses maintained like old style. And u can do little trekking.
Tam-awan Village,If you are looking for a solemn nature trip this is a good place especially if not peak season. At the same time you'll be able to appreciate the tribe's culture and art. :)
Tam-awan Village,Nature and art in one place. Not very much accessible to public transport so its best to rent a private vehicle/cab/taxi to bring you to and from this place. Entrance fee is collected for maintenance and upkeep. Some areas may be slippery especially on wet season. Late review - visit date: May 2018
Tam-awan Village,a short but very invigorating nature trip. dont try to miss this one. we had a mini hike to the top and had much fun. then we check different native house. good thing they were able to preserve it. and ofcourse the art gallery thats so wonderful. you gotta appreciate the way they did their craft. see sample of pictures. enjoy
Tam-awan Village,"Nice little place, intersting to see the artists paintings,scultures, little exhibitions in the traditionnal houses even though that's not a village. mini trek, in the beajtiful landscape around it."
Tam-awan Village,So perfect when you need some me time... Walking through the paths and discovering branched ways along the way for me is the best feeling... I find it meditating and don't forget to walk through the area with mirrors!It takes about 2 hours if you are alone and wants to discover the place by yourself... Quite difficult to reach thru public transport due to limited jeepneys so taxi is better.
Tam-awan Village,It is good for somebody visiting Baguio for the first time to go and see Taw Awan Village
Tam-awan Village,"Thank you Tam - awan villageThe place is good, so relaxing, and the igorot dance so enjoy to watch, friendly staffWe will promote this place to our friendsLove it❤️❤️❤️"
Tam-awan Village,"It's a must-go for everyone visiting Baguio. Entrance is 60 PHP per person and you'll have a helpful guide to tell tales about the Ibaloi culture from their religion to daily living.The tour lasts around one hour and you'll be taken to art exhibits, old houses, and view points.You can buy arts and crafts stuff, which I think are reasonably priced considering they monopolize the area. Many souvenir stuff there are uniquely found in the place, so if you LOVE something, buy it!You can also buy paintings and have a sketching session.They also have a restaurant that serves delicious meals. We ordered Pinikpikan (surprisingly large enough for 4 to 5 people), Pomodoro Pasta, and a bottle of Strawberry Wine (which is fair priced at 250 PHP).As a side note: Pinikpikan is a dish using chicken meat that was repeatedly beaten to death, giving it a unique taste because of the blood clots. Besides chicken, it also has salted pork (Etag)."
Tam-awan Village,I love anything ethnic and this place has a lot to offer they even has a dance show ( igorot dance)  with igorot costume. What i love here most is the gallery with paintings of different artist. They also have shop where you can buy souvenirs and if you want accommodation they have also the igorot house where you will experience first hand. Don' forget to trekk You'll love the experience.
Tam-awan Village,"A few Igorot native huts scattered in the property,  a cafe, a barebones gallery and souvenir shop,  plus a challenging hike up the hillside (Garden in the sky) which is really not advisable for elderly and not so active people,  that's all there is to this destination. Quite not worth the 60 pesos entrance fee."
Tam-awan Village,"Garden in the sky, nice place to visit if you're within Baguio and want a little hike. It has replicas of traditional Ifugao houses, small art galley, and a view deck on top."
Tam-awan Village,A native village with their natice houses. There is a resto insidrle and an artist who sketched in 20 mins of any picture but would take around 20 mins more so a total of 40 mins. The pathway to the viewdeck is unsafe specially if there would be a rain. View could not really be appreciated if there is a fog
Tam-awan Village,"This is the place where the rich cultural heritage of the Cordillerans are displayed through the ingenius artworks of many well-known artists. From paintings and drawings on display, to simple handmade accessory in their souvenir shop, there'll surely be something in store for everyone. Great for presents to friends and loved ones. I esp. loved the coffee shop/resto, nice ambience. Minimal entrance fee (P50 for adults). For students, make sure to bring your ID's to get a discount. Tip: Come during the summer months. The pathways are narrow/ascending and tends to get muddy/slippery. Wear comfortable shoes."
Tam-awan Village,"Make sure you use proper shoes for ""biglaang hiking"" haha! Better be safe than sorry because I was wearing vans shoes and it's very slippery. Overall experience is a perfect 10/10! The view, paintings, weather, food, people and the history in it are very well taken care of."
Tam-awan Village,"It was okay. View from the deck was not so good with mostly just roofs and houses. Parking is not very many. I liked the pond, the native houses. There is also a souveneir shop, an art gallery, a very short trail, and a view deck."
Tam-awan Village,"Truly a place to see in La Trinidad that preserves cultural heritage.Seniors may find it a challenge with steep climbs and stairs. But for those I saw after visiting the place, surely felt glad to have done so.Park your vehicles along the side of the road and will be asssited by attendants. PUJ's are also available for commuters.Your next stop should be Mount Costa."
Tam-awan Village,"so-so with lil kids they are short tempered this place are for those who loves nature and art at the same time...  trails are slippery. if ill got lot money and decorate home with paintings surely i know where i could buy (ill come back here). the only regret was i should start the trail at the right side instead at the left trail...  because i saw a portrait on the spot for only 150/head 30 mins to finish good remembrance to keep. (i was not able to got my portrait because of the hungry,  irritating kids with me)😕entrance fee is 50/adultkids 10-below 20/ head3ft and below -free(*paintings are for sale * souvenir shop inside* resto inside)"
Tam-awan Village,"Nice place, a bit long trail with hiking. The steps sometimes is slippery because of the moss, seniors are advisable to be escorted to prevent slippage."
Tam-awan Village,"A traditional heritage cottages and show, with small land scape of jungle, and nothing more, they have restaurant but no any traditional foods"
Tam-awan Village,Tam Awan Village - Garden in the Sky. You can find an authentic Igorot Hut with a village trail designed to adapt to the natural mountainous trail of the Cordilleras. A must have visit! A fee of 60 pesos for Adults and 40 for kids.
Tam-awan Village,One of the quiet place we've visit in Baguio
Tam-awan Village,"I have been coming here for years. The only thing that has noticeably changed is more trails on the hill and couple buildings.  Some early artist have made a name for themselves for sure. But i don't understand this place. By now with the cash that have brought in and the artists that have been through here they should have a museum, endowment, much improved artists spaces and able to support and nurture an entire community of artists.  Either way, ill keep coming, hoping one day its true potential will be borne out!"
Tam-awan Village,This place brings you closer to the arts and traditions of the indigeneous tribe of Benguet Mt. Province-- The Igorot tribe.A cultural dance is also something that you shouldn't miss!
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-awan has a great summary of Cordilleran history if you haven't discovered any of these. Moreover, the place is also a spot to pick-up souvenirs. The downsides of this spot is that it's a little ways off the city proper and it's a little underdeveloped (which in hindsight, may be because they want to keep the mountainside feel). You should be careful if you are bringing Seniors."
Tam-awan Village,it's a go-to place for art lover peeps but a tiring place to go around. haha
Tam-awan Village,A cultural historical place where the basic lives of our ancestor showcased and preserved well.
Tam-awan Village,"Entrance fee Php 60, strawberry and ube taho are available, there are Ifugao houses, cafe, sketch area and art gallery. Taxi rate from Burham is Php 110 pesos. Long wait for taxi /jeep going back to Burnham."
Tam-awan Village,"Place is cool. Nice contrast of green and red which is relaxing in the eyes. A little hike, overlooking, overall... it's refreshing."
Tam-awan Village,Very informative about the Igorots culture. I love the displayed paintings. Just be careful especially when you decide to climb the higher part of the village.
Tam-awan Village,Love the paintings here
Tam-awan Village,An immersive experience.I get to enjoy their dance performances.Will require you to traverse steep rocky climbs.
Tam-awan Village,"Good art works. But we were lost inside because of lack of signages and no one to guide us. ""Can't find the beauty of this place"" I comemented to my sister who is with me during my visit here."
Tam-awan Village,"If you are planning to visit Tam awan, you need to wear shoes because its slippery this place is a mountain so you gonna climb to see the small cottages made of wood, the small art gallery. Going there takes 20mins by taxi. And the intrance fee is 60 pesos for adult and 30 pesos for the kids."
Tam-awan Village,Don't expect too much when you go the place..entrance fee is 60 pesos for adult..they have cafe if you want to eat
Tam-awan Village,Good for long walking. Great heights. Near farmer's daughter resto. Be early or you lose the parking space.
Tam-awan Village,Awesome historical place. Must visit. Do take the guided tour. Closes like 6 pm in the evening. So plan better.
Tam-awan Village,"This is not your usual tourist destination.  The Village requires you to hike to reach the different art installations and cultural artifacts. It can be difficult for young kids.  We were actually dissuaded from climbing to the 2nd View Deck because the kids may not make the climb.  The trail around the Village was a bit slippery. However, the trails were clearly marked and the art pieces had their own name plates and descriptions.  The aroma from the cafe was also appetizing."
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-awan, meaning vantage point, is a reconstructed Cordillera village. Aside from a great view of Baguio, you are also treated to beautiful works of art by local artists, displayed in galleries around the village. Definitely a must-visit location when in Baguio!"
Tam-awan Village,Foods are great and staff are friendly! Will surely come back the next time we visit Baguio City. Highly recommended. Wi-Fi access is awesome!
Tam-awan Village,Absolutely wonderful place full of art and other hidden gems. You'll find an unlimited supply of Instagramable places for photo ops!
Tam-awan Village,April 14 2017I was in tam awan village back in april 14 2017. Its a must visit destination in baguio city and pet friendly also.
Tam-awan Village,"A must place to visit in Baguio...to understand Tam Awan's Culture and Arts.  A little exercise of your hiking ability, so be ready with your comfy shoes and enjoy the nature while visiting this village."
Tam-awan Village,Not much going on in here. Just a quick art tour around to appreciate. Involves a bit of climbing which are also slippery on the rainy season. View is honestly terrible from the view decks. There is a place to eat and have coffee here
Tam-awan Village,"A really nice cultural place to visit in while you're in Baguio. There are traditional huts, cafes, and at exhibitions held here."
Tam-awan Village,A visual artist’s sanctuary. Anyone who loves arts will love this place though it has a very creepy vibe.
Tam-awan Village,Place is ok. Perfect for nature-loving tourists.
Tam-awan Village,"The entrance fee is at PhP60.00 for adults.This isn't a living native village instead this is a man-made landscape designed for tourists to be able to take a nice hike. They have interesting plants, they have museum pieces such as a real rice granary that was used by the natives long ago, replicas of native houses and their different functions. This is a place for people who are interested to learn cultures.I recommend wearing a good pair of shoes fit for hiking as the ground tend to be slippery."
Tam-awan Village,"You can stay here in an historical hut, cottage. Walking up and down between the huts to two view points. Meet artist and and do different art class. Take taxi to go there only 60 piso, jeepney back."
Tam-awan Village,Nice garden but only takes 1/2 to an 1 hour to go through not well maintained paths supports post loss for hand rails
Tam-awan Village,Amazing view. specially in viewdeck 2. The cultural dancers are good. The place was nice. Its near Farmers daughter restaurant and igorot stone kingdom.
Tam-awan Village,This spot is worth it! Esp if u like nature tripping.Restau inside is good too!
Tam-awan Village,"The best for pictorial, and also the ambiance of the trees"
Tam-awan Village,"The place is full of art works. Not for the elderly as the steps are steep. We went when it was raining, not recommended during the rainy season"
Tam-awan Village,Nice place for learning the traditional Igorot culture and art. Also offers lots of souvenirs for tourists.
Tam-awan Village,Big area to go around and you'll see art pieces and replica artifacts of how the tribes lived. Their view deck was a bit sad cause your view was the clustered houses.
Tam-awan Village,"The view was good. If you love climbing mountains, you can go here."
Tam-awan Village,Indigenous surroundings showcasing the culture of the people! Painting workshops and galleries too!
Tam-awan Village,Great tourist spot!  Probably the best place to go in Baguio!  Did not see many tourists in Baguio and will not return. Too dirty and loud now!
Tam-awan Village,- Loved the place ❤️- Amazing staff 😍- Place is a bit slippery so be careful 😘
Tam-awan Village,If you are a nature lover you will love this place..Comes with great view deck.
Tam-awan Village,"An open museum close to nature just like Pinto Art and Bencab, P60.00 per person (2019). A twist in here is that you have go up and down with the cliffs to enjoy the views. Be careful of the unknown insects here. We went here and had multiple bites that we still dont know what insects are they."
Tam-awan Village,Too slippery.  I was more concerned on where I'm stepping.The young Igorot dancers were a joy to watch though.
Tam-awan Village,"This place is for those who appreciate art & poetry, paintings, sculptures, nature, short trek, and the like. Thank you for putting up a haven for the local artists and promoting the crafts and ingenuity of Baguio/Northern Luzon folks. The cafe is artistically designed and the food is served fresh and hot, great for cold waether. I liked all thei food choices. Taste of the local is great. The coffee smells good. I brought a Korean friend here and he loved it."
Tam-awan Village,"Has limited access for parking and not accessible for PWDs.The stairs are man made, the rails are bamboos and the steps are carved from soil which makes it muddy and slippery during rainy season.If you are going with kids or with oldies, I do not recommend going during rainy season."
Tam-awan Village,how great theifugao dancers to watch the traditional dance of ifugao
Tam-awan Village,Nice place to relax your mind. This garden is full of arts and cultural information.
Tam-awan Village,"Peaceful. If you're looking for something that is of art and nature related, this is the place to be."
Tam-awan Village,Great cultural experience. Some parts are muddy and slippery. We enjoyed our adventure here. It's far from the urban area but the experience is worthy.
Tam-awan Village,This is our last stop for our 3day Baguio Tour and it didn't dissapoint us. We get to see the different traditional houses for the rich and poor of the natives way back.
Tam-awan Village,Nice artsy Igorot village replica with house designs you could actually live in. Also nice artworks in their gallery. Too bad they don't serve any civet cat coffee. I bought two packs two years ago and it was heavenly. Now the one I bought in Sagada is not as good.
Tam-awan Village,Quick cultural immersion.  Highly recommended if you have not visited this tourist spot.
Tam-awan Village,Great place for art lover also very peaceful and cool place
Tam-awan Village,"For just 60 pesos, you get to experience the cool and quiet Tam-Awan Village. It was fun seeing works of local artists which really showed the rich culture of the place."
Tam-awan Village,Good place to visit. Need to ready your feet
Tam-awan Village,The guided tour was a little short but it was very informative.  Would highly recommend.
Tam-awan Village,"Nice place to unwind alongside the nice weather of Baguio. Although, would suggest that they'll put another view deck on top. To see the overview."
Tam-awan Village,You have to had enough energy to climb to viewdeck. The scenery is beautiful and for me its refreshing.
Tam-awan Village,Amazing Artworks
Tam-awan Village,"Place is, uhm good to visit if you have kids. And if you're really looking for the ethnic experince. No Tam-Awans to see though, would be worth it if you'd pay for the guide. The food in their restaurant is great!!"
Tam-awan Village,A very relaxing and peaceful place with real touch of nature..
Tam-awan Village,Good place and good hike to get to the top and take instagram-able photos.
Tam-awan Village,"Nice view over baguio, very cold weather, also its a bit big and required a little bit of hiking."
Tam-awan Village,Awesome place!!! Thank you!
Tam-awan Village,"Nice place to visit in Baguio, but very small area to walk around."
Tam-awan Village,A humble place that showcase Baguio Local Artists. A must visit in baguio.
Tam-awan Village,"I miss those times when there were real Igorot tour guides who tell you about their culture and Tamawan Village. Don't forget to go inside the huts, some of them are accessible."
Tam-awan Village,Great!
Tam-awan Village,Of all the places I've visited so far in Baguio this is where I enjoyed the most. A must visit place. Promise.
Tam-awan Village,"This is a wonderful experience, not just for me, but for my nieces and nephews too.Will definitely go back there in the future."
Tam-awan Village,First time but this place never disappoint me. I love the view from the top.
Tam-awan Village,A perfect display of Cordilleran culture located at Benguet.
Tam-awan Village,"If you are truly a nature lover,you can drop and visit the place,what you can see there is the old ways of living of their people,their kind of old house or kubo in the village.What i like there is the trekking i perspire a bit even its too cold in there....and be careful of the animals esp...the snake we saw a very small snake ,like the size of our smallest finger and i call the attention of the guide,and what he told us is just be careful coz we dont kill them,i am with him though.....all in all its an experience also its cold there,and please buy their products...."
Tam-awan Village,"An alternative experience in Baguio apart from the usual tourist sites. My favorite, besides the beautiful artwork of Baguio artists, is the trek up the view point to witness the Baguio sunset."
Tam-awan Village,Good place and friendly staff the boss was also very accomodating. Loved the bonfire!
Tam-awan Village,"Great place to learn about cordilleran culture and heritage. There are other places to visit within Baguio (or the whole of the Cordillera Region), but you should Tam-awan village in your itinerary."
Tam-awan Village,Where art and nature meet. But I think the entrance fee of 60 pesos may not be that reasonable.
Tam-awan Village,"Place is too small. No good spot for taking pictures. Muddy stairs, kinda dangerous."
Tam-awan Village,Nice place I enjoyed it. They got native igorot dance.
Tam-awan Village,If u like a light trail... preferrably afternoon... the cafe served good food
Tam-awan Village,Place is good if you want to see a photo gallery and watch a cultural dance and also if you want to see a beautiful sceneries of Benguet.
Tam-awan Village,"Educational..nice place to enrich cultural values. Nice Trekking place, you just have to be careful."
Tam-awan Village,Nice place to see the culture of cordillera and meet with the locals
Tam-awan Village,Awesome with free coffee  and camote due to festival
Tam-awan Village,Beautiful place that showcases art of indigenous people.
Tam-awan Village,Liked it so much the restaurant there is good too
Tam-awan Village,This place is a must visit! Shows how rich the culture of the region is.
Tam-awan Village,For 60 pesos entrance it's okay. Not super big but they have a small trail and gallery. And other things Takes around a hour to see everything.
Tam-awan Village,A good place to learn about history and culture. Visit this place when it is not raining to avoid slipping along the stairs while climbing.
Tam-awan Village,This place is great but there is little to see. You may find great paintings in their art museum. You may also want your portrait to be painted by the artists that frequents there. You may also experience dancing the cordillera dance when you go there in tge weekends.
Tam-awan Village,Totally love this place just view the photo😍
Tam-awan Village,"They’ve re-opened since August. It’s my second time after more than 10 years and it is still a beautiful place to appreciate nature and Ifugao culture. We hiked, entered the typical Igorot house, breathed fresh air, feasted in a rich flora & ended with a free taste of local wines — strawberry, duhat, rice wine, over some street food. Bought a woven head band in the souvenir shop."
Tam-awan Village,Food are expensive if you don't like art what's point visiting it
Tam-awan Village,Love the arts. The ambience is great.
Tam-awan Village,Historical arts and culture
Tam-awan Village,I liked the traditional dance. The hiking trail was tough and a bit dangerous for children aged 7 below. I saw one snake passing by in front of me. I was not so shocked because the place is almost like a forest with a community inside.
Tam-awan Village,The place is good for exploring. Good stuff. The trail is very slippery specially during rainy days. You'll find no guides or anyone to ask for assistance. They have a disclosure of being not liable for any injuries occurred inside so be very careful.
Tam-awan Village,Amazing art and view in one place.
Tam-awan Village,They have rooms that you can book for an overnight stay.
Tam-awan Village,It's my 1st time here and I enjoyed it.
Tam-awan Village,Very educational. Made me appreciate my country's culture even more.
Tam-awan Village,"Art, culture, education and fun in 1"
Tam-awan Village,A Local village with traditional cultural information and arts.
Tam-awan Village,"One of a kind place. There are 2 galleries here a souvenir shop and a cafe on site with local grown coffee and eats. All the souvenirs are local made. Follow all the paths when you are there some beautiful and unique hidden spots. Like the pathway of mirrors; the bamboo bridges, hidden koi pond, spirit house and more."
Tam-awan Village,Super nice. 😊 Amazing artworks.
Tam-awan Village,"Good place to go on a weekday where visitors are not that many. Tho on the weekend cordilleran cultural dance is presented. Honestly nothing much to see, it's basically a hillside decorated with cordilleran huts that are not that awing. Again what's good the see are the cultural dancers and the traditional cordilleran attire you can use for free that you won't look like a tourist. They also have a portrait artist who has excellent work."
Tam-awan Village,Nice place for nature lovers.
Tam-awan Village,"It's a great place to get to know the people of Tam-awan. Learn about their way of living, their culture and their art. You can also join them dance! The area is mossy though probably because of the season during our visit. But it's worth to visit."
Tam-awan Village,full of art..cool weather..awesome!!
Tam-awan Village,Not much to expect. A hundred bucks fee is not really worth it. Parking is a mess. A very risky hiking experience with a not so safe trail and stairways.
Tam-awan Village,"eat at there cafe, they'll served you an over size meals 👌👌👌"
Tam-awan Village,It was ok not that much good what we think
Tam-awan Village,"It was a bit rainy because of two tropical depressions in Luzon but the place was still open, there were still some people visiting the place. The map they provided was simple enough to understand, somedays there are cultural presentations inside but we didn't see one. The experience was quite enlightening to have to witness the eclectic art collection and the different houses of the Cordilleras."
Tam-awan Village,It is great place! But too small. They have a biggest dream catcher I ever seen. And some arts from tribe are so beautiful.P.S don't go up. Nothing there in upper view point.
Tam-awan Village,still love going to this place. it's like my comfort zone when in baguio.
Tam-awan Village,A must visit place in Baguio ! The place has a lot of steps so expect a little “hike”. The steps could get a little slippery especially if it has rained. Might not be grandparent or child friendly however the beautiful scenery is worth the hike. Must watch the cultural dance as well !
Tam-awan Village,The peak is one of my most fave points. You can really see the fog. We came here and it was rainy so I would say that the village was not as vibrant as it should be. The have a nice gallery and accomodating staff. It was also brownout when we came here and they have no gensets so yeah. I wish they could improve the stairs and the path.
Tam-awan Village,"Good place to explore to appreciate nature, art, and culture. Be sure to ask for guidance how to navigate the facility."
Tam-awan Village,So many excitement place and the dancer igorot so very good😊
Tam-awan Village,"If you're up for a quick trek, this is it. Parts of the trail are slippery too as some are moist and a bit muddy. My companions who can't make it up stayed to view the galleries that showcased the rich culture of the locals"
Tam-awan Village,"If you are into arts and culture or just in search of the perfect background for your next profile picture, this place is for you. There are colorful murals and paintings and well preserved ancient Igorot houses. There are cafes and restaurants nearby too. However, caution is proper if you are with children and elderlies because visitors need to climb some steep stairs to fully explore the whole village."
Tam-awan Village,"Family bonding, relaxing.. nice place.. friends venue..😘😍😊"
Tam-awan Village,very good place for the culturally-inclined
Tam-awan Village,We didn't really enjoy it quite slippery make sure to wear proper trekking shoes if you want to visit it and enjoy to the fullest... Entrance fee is a dollar or less so don't expect much unless you are a really really nature lover.
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-awan Village really made sure Baguio's culture will be showcased in the most authentic possible way. However, guests are not ""warned"" of the steep trek going to the viewpoint. There were no signs around the place how many more meters/steps to finish the trail. Overall, will still recommend to teens or adult tourists but not kids and seniors."
Tam-awan Village,"experience local culture and arts here. it is also an artist haven ( have your pencil sketch done by a local artist, in Dec 2019 it was PhP 300 for about 10-15 minutes live sketching). you can arrange to stay at traditional igorot house and enjoy nature in this village."
Tam-awan Village,Really liked the experience. Simple hike and it's an important good to support local culture. It's also good to be a part of helping reduce poverty around the world and especially in the Philippines.
Tam-awan Village,We visited December 2017. There's really not much to see aside from very few interesting things plus the hike. They should either develop it or at least lessen the fee so they could attract more people.
Tam-awan Village,Very relaxing place to go around and check on different artworks. Parking is a problem
Tam-awan Village,The area was not organizedTemperature was great
Tam-awan Village,Fun place to visit while in Baguio
Tam-awan Village,"I wouldn't say it's the most original but I think it's still a great place or something you'll put in your 'lists of places to go when visiting Baguio'. The art gallery contains a lot of interesting things and also there are things that will make you go ooooh and of course, there are stuffs that will make you go 'mehh'. It also showcases some cultural and historical topics and themes about Cordillera. Overall, I find It great and still has a lot of space to grow."
Tam-awan Village,Prepeare for a hiking experience to reach the top of the said mountain perfect to watch the sunset. The art here is truly amazing and you can even get a sketch of yourself
Tam-awan Village,"It is a quite interesting place to visit when you've been to Baguio a couple of times and you hope to go somewhere other than the usual destinations in Baguio. But I find it a bit small, and I was hoping to see more. However the entrance fee was inexpensive, so I suppose it wasn't all that bad."
Tam-awan Village,trail was neat and easy 😊 good for family affair. gallery featured Eclipse 🌒
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-awan used to be a nice place where different local artists can exhibit their works. Now, it is now poorly maintained and the facilities are so old. There are no good views from here and trail is far to be appreciated."
Tam-awan Village,A place to relax and feel the nature while walking in the trails. There are artworks and live band.
Tam-awan Village,"If you are into culture, arts, tradition, and environment, this place is for you. You,ll find paintings as well as murals in the area. There are some replica houses of the northern Cordillera tribes. There are also huts/rooms for rent to stay for the night. A must place to visit when in Baguio"
Tam-awan Village,Good food. Have to prepare yourself with steep steps though.
Tam-awan Village,Appreciate more if there is a tour guide who will explain the stuffs inside the village
Tam-awan Village,Awesome place!
Tam-awan Village,You can feel that they are trying to preserve their traditions. A group of will showcase their traditions by doing some of their traditional dances. Surprisingly they have little room that has full of paintings which.
Tam-awan Village,In short there really wasn't much at all to see and do. The 2nd view deck also has no views and no deck. It is just an overgrown loop track with nothing much to see. There are much better tourist destinations to see in Ph than here. Not worth the visit IMO.
Tam-awan Village,"Climbed to the top, to see what's on view deck 2, and I was disappointed. Trees were covering the supposed to be view but if you really try to look beyond those trees, you'll see houses. Urbanization destroyed the surrounding area. I am not complaining, I tried to see what's in it at least. Should have taken a pic"
Tam-awan Village,"Not much to see except for the local cultural dance. If you like walking on elevated dirt paths then go ahead and try it. Otherwise, try going somewhere else instead."
Tam-awan Village,"Garden in the  sky, that's  Tam awan village  although  its  not a  real native  village  but has  been converted to contemporary  art gallery where  you can get  nature  and  art  .Nestled into the hilly mountains of Baguio is an unsuspecting art village. At a glance, you only notice traditional huts with grass roofs scattered on different levels of elevation throughout the forest.they  have  nice  forest views  koi  ponds and  much more. Enterance  is  60 Php"
Tam-awan Village,"I went there september 28, 2022"
Tam-awan Village,There's a cute cat in here. The cat was sleeping and keeps on sleeping while we are there. They also got a cafe wherr you can buy coffee for an affordable price. We got an unexpected trekking there.
Tam-awan Village,"Best to go when there's an event or tourist seasons like holy week. Get there by taxi, around P90 from town, w traffic. Also a Jeep route, but forgot what it's called. On regular days, the ""village"" is dead."
Tam-awan Village,I love the place small compact but able  to tell the world of its heritage
Tam-awan Village,"Well preserved place of history and culture to know what Baguio City really is about. The place is a bit steep and high, so if planning of going, it is better to wear comfortable clothes to fully enjoy the place and tour."
Tam-awan Village,"Nice place, nice heritage, nice people and nice coffee. Love this place but be extra careful in driving their roads."
Tam-awan Village,ambiance is nice but viewdeck 2 is not worth it. culture is well maintained.
Tam-awan Village,Best place to escape from stressful working week. A place to bond with your love ones.
Tam-awan Village,The place to get your art fix. A one stop shop for culture and arts. Witness the traditional cordillera dances...have your portrait drawn or if you are lucky you might get a nice view of the sunset.
Tam-awan Village,The entrance fee for adults is 60php and 40php for students and kids. It was affordable for a very nice place to visit. :) You can even wear their traditional costume for free.
Tam-awan Village,Culture Rich Resto. But you have to pay entrance fee.. hope to lower the fee
Tam-awan Village,A fairly exhausting yet enjoyable side trip specially when you choose to continue hiking until the end of the trail. Lots of interesting stuff to see.
Tam-awan Village,"If you love nature, visit the place"
Tam-awan Village,"if you want to experience some traditions of cordillera, the taste of Ki-niing (smoke meat) and see exquisite painting of local artist, you should visit this place."
Tam-awan Village,Very interesting place although not extensive. Wandering at your leisure you come across some delightful views and some interesting buildings and pathways.
Tam-awan Village,"A must visit if you are in Baguio. Well worth the symbolic price of 50 pesos. Went on a gloomy day and it was picture perfect. A bit slippery and lots of stairs, so not recommended for the elderly."
Tam-awan Village,Small village with interesting stories. Hard to find parking though
Tam-awan Village,"It's a good place to unwind and relax not that much crowded,not that typical it's between a hiking and art place, there's a restaurant nearby were you can eat exotic food"
Tam-awan Village,"It a good place to see culture and arts, especially the works of the many talented artists displayed. It also shows the wonders of nature with many plant life atop of a slope."
Tam-awan Village,Very cool place. But it's veru tiring to get up to the mountains. Not everyone can finish the whole tour. I suggest to read the notice in the entrance before proceeding.
Tam-awan Village,Good location for appreciation of Cordilleran tradition.
Tam-awan Village,Rode a bike from Burnham Park to this place. Good for those who are appreciative of arts and culture of the tribe. Too many paintings. There's a souvenir store and sketch service inside.
Tam-awan Village,"Great stop for your Baguio trip. You can see here the Cordilleran culture from the houses, bul-ols and arts. They have free guided tours"
Tam-awan Village,"I haven't been to anywhere else like Tam-awan village. Hence, the five stars. I learned a lot about the lifestyle of the natives. The staff are actually Igorots. We talked to one of them and he taught us a lot about the bululs and some of the rituals. The place is big, but they'll give you a small map upon entering to help you navigate the area."
Tam-awan Village,"I'm not sure where the good reviews came from but it's gonna be 1 star for me. Probably because I've been to better studios, seen better installations that are priced with way more value for my money. At 50 pesos you'd get to see a mishmash of mirrors made in china (with the 15 peso price tag still intact) hung around bushes they called an art installation!I am all for Cordilleran cultural education but when I read about their justification of making their own bulul of their own invention (in the pretext of art) and installed to serve a purpose of their own imagined purpose I was disappointed.The entire place is disappointing, it's an embarrassment to the local culture it professes to promote. It's a complete hoax (except for a few select pieces) and it tried so hard to mask it by setting up authentic Cordilleran houses."
Tam-awan Village,I came here with no expectations but I really enjoyed the place.   There will be a bit of walking involved so make sure you wear the right shoes especially if you want to explore the place. Take your time in each kubo to appreciate the artworks.
Tam-awan Village,"I hope their food has more taste than their coffee, which was about 50% strength. Otherwise, charming atmosphere to relax after hiking the hills."
Tam-awan Village,Peaceful… arts and nature
Tam-awan Village,"Tam awan village a bit far from the city center, you need to pay an entrance fee of 50 and you need a strong knees to climb up the big stones stairs, their gallery is nice, we did not stay long its hard to go up hahahaha not suitable for  very old people."
Tam-awan Village,"This place is for people who appreciate and respect ""art, culture and tradition"" of the Cordilleras. One must wear appropriate footwear in order to be able to ""hike"" the trails."
Tam-awan Village,Symbolizes traditional Ifugao culture
Tam-awan Village,"It's a very good place to have a look of the rich Cordilleran culture. Just bring a good rubber shoes, it's a slippery slope during rainy days and in the morning."
Tam-awan Village,The best part of the experience was watching a performance of mountain tribal dances
Tam-awan Village,"we loved Tam awan the first time we visited in 2014, but we were utterly disappointed when we went back last march 2018, they weren't able to maintain it's beauty especially the view deck 2, and the fact that they collect entrance fee per head but still weren't able to maintain it just adds to our disappointment"
Tam-awan Village,Great place to feel the culture of the Northern Province.
Tam-awan Village,"Theres payment for comfort room, 5 pesos. Not that clean and theres no tissue. Very slippery when climbing up. Theres not that much too see except houses from a high point of view."
Tam-awan Village,Not much to see. The village l visited a decade ago seems much better. It seem it was relocated. Nothing to see but small museum and a few hike. Entrance fee is not worth it.
Tam-awan Village,"Eight traditional Ifugao homes and two rare Kalinga huts were taken apart and then reassembled on the side of a hill at the artist colony Tram-awan Village. Spending the night in one of these huts is a rare treat. You can participate in art workshops, learn dream-catcher making, and see indigenous music and dance demonstrations. On clear days there are wonderful views of the South China Sea. To get there, take a Quezon Hill-Tam-awan or Tam-awan-Long-Long jeepney from the corner of Kayang and Shagem Sts."
Tam-awan Village,It's more on arts and culture
Tam-awan Village,It's good to see the place and to request for a tour guide.They are open to accommodate tourists over night in their huts.
Tam-awan Village,...miss the place. brief but worth it.
Tam-awan Village,Good walking shoes required. Have a picture of you and someone on your phone. A nice lady will sketch it and she does a nice job
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-awan. Vantage Point. Overlooking. This is a nic place where you get to catch a glimpse of the rich culture and tradition of Benguet. The artworks are so pleasing to the eyes and heart. Busog na yung eyes mo, nakapag-exercise ka pa as you roam around elevated spots. I think it would be better if may tourist guide kayo na idedeploy per batch, para mas ma-explain yung ibang spots and hindi ma-out of track. That's it!"
Tam-awan Village,"Best time to go there is during sunny season (if you wish to hike uphill),  the pathways are slippery during wet season (take extra care and watch your steps when walking)."
Tam-awan Village,A place of modern and traditional culture
Tam-awan Village,"Better not to include this place in your  tour, because its far from other spots and nothing to see here, only huts.And there is an entrance fee plus its not good for elders."
Tam-awan Village,The place and art exhibits are fascinating. It wad just raining when I visited so we were not able to roam outdoor trails.
Tam-awan Village,We went hear when it was raining so hard! I say that it gave an eerie feel which made me feel more appreciative for nature. The place is good.
Tam-awan Village,🙂 I cant say anything much
Tam-awan Village,"OJTs as tourist guide r well trained and very pleasant, too. Learned quite a lot about d igorots' culture. The pasalubong items r quite pricey compared to other areas...."

Tam-awan Village,60 entrance fee for adult not worth it.
Tam-awan Village,Nice place to visit. Local youngsters the original indigenous dances on Saturday. Expected village of a bigger size though.

Tam-awan Village,A place where you can learn as it showcase local heritage.
Tam-awan Village,"The artists haven in the sky. Known for its authentic Cordillerian huts and its internationally renown artists.

Some notable artists you might encounter in the Village are John Frank Sabado, Art Lozano and Jordan Mango-san."

Tam-awan Village,Nice person nice venue and friends get to see again and foggy while at the place.

Tam-awan Village,so cool and cute❤️❤️❤️
Tam-awan Village,"If you're ready for a quick and educational tour, head out to Pinsao Proper and visit this very unique place, Tam-Awan Village. I paid less than a hundred at the entrance area and then they will provide you a tour guide. It was a very educational trek for me. The tour guide Chester, made sure that I am safe while we're up and down the stairs, (I was just wearing my leather sandals that time, wasn't expecting that it will rain, it was slippery) he brought me to the gallery then to the different huts that was used by the Ifugao people ages ago. It was a fun way of learning, and the view up above was breath taking. There's a cafeteria inside the village and before I went to my next destination, I got myself some souvenirs from their Souvenir Shop. If you'll visit the place, wear sneakers and put on some insect repellent."

Tam-awan Village,"Man-made area for tourists, not well maintained. Igorot dancing is appreciated, however they don’t seem to know theircraft well."
Tam-awan Village,It is one of the must to go places in Baguio if want to watch and learn their cultural dances.
Tam-awan Village,"A decent place among many attractions in BaguioNothing to see other than dance performancesThere are no handrails in many places during the climbing process. Although the climb is short (20 minutes slow), the road is slippery, so be careful."
Tam-awan Village,"These mountains were the land of the Igorot tribes.This Igorot ethnographic village is well organized for sightseeing.The village is tiny and very collected, perched on a rather steep mountain side, surrounded by very lush and colorful vegetation.The 11th Tam-Awan Arts Festival recently took place and traditional works are mixed with modern onesThere are several wooden huts with water-repellent thatched roofs.Next to each hut / work there are plaques that illustrate the ethnic / artistic context.There is a wedding hut, for the honeymoon, on stilts, with a special 'do not disturb' tinsel too.Mirrors are hung on a driveway with the aim of representing past, present and future… beyond that, a scarecrow.However, the rooms are small and getting around is not easy."
Tam-awan Village,"The place is cool and has many trees, traditional dance with unspoiled terraced paths like being lost in a forest."
Tam-awan Village,"Tam-Awan Village. A must-visit spot in Baguio. You must have a photographer with you to make your gala worthwhile. And for those who love coffee, you can have coffee at their restaurant. Their salad is delicious. Bastaaaaa it's good here, there's more good food. go with friends!"
Tam-awan Village,"It was beautiful here, the design of nature and the simple means of life is beautiful, the large pond with its koi carp is also wonderful. It is recommended to make a stop and eat some toast, which tasted very tasty and the fries were very tasty. It is recommended to wear sturdy shoes when complaining about Tam-awan Village.It was beautiful here, the design of nature and the simple means of life is beautiful, the large pond with its koi carp is also wonderful.

Tam-awan Village,"100 pesos by taxi from downtown BaguioAdmission is 60 pesos, but there is nothing special to see.There is a short hiking course and the air is very good because it is a mountain."
Tam-awan Village,"Nice art works. The ambience is super relaxing. Their mascot Hydro the cat is also cute, Suplado nga lang, 😁"
Tam-awan Village,"For 60 pesos per head, these are goods. You will also get tired because the trails are not flat. Of course, when it rains, the other stairs are slippery. The dance they did was also good."
Tam-awan Village,"If you can only go to one place in Baguio, I recommend it here.bamboo forest walktraditional performanceExhibition of local artistsview from higheverything is great"
Tam-awan Village,"Location:Expectation Vs. Reality, It's a waste of 60 pesos here.Parking:Don't bring a car here, the jeep is easy to get there, if you go it's near Burnham Park on Kayang Street.Experience:There's nothing to lose, so don't give up if you can avoid it :)"
Tam-awan Village,Here you will find ancient igorot houses and unique paintings
Tam-awan Village,"It is still a must see place around Baguio. If you're going to the Igorot Stone Kingdom, pass by it too. Someone performs Igorot dances. The ambiance in the area is different and you can even do a quick hiking/trekking. There is also a small souvenir store that is very unique compared to the Generic Baguio Souvenir stores around."
Tam-awan Village,Where to visit Baguio. Admission fee P50.Like the Aboriginal Culture and Art Village.There is a nice restaurant next to it!
Tam-awan Village,"Great outdoor activity. Watch out for trails because they are slippery. But if you are alone, it's okay ... you know what's left. 😄"
Tam-awan Village,Nice place..nkakarelax..
Tam-awan Village,It gives you that feeling of where and how our fellow Filipinos and our culture began. Such a nice place especially if you love history.
Tam-awan Village,Entrance is 10 pesos
Tam-awan Village,Fine Arts Center Paintings and the story of the people of the place and the roads and heights of nature Hallelujah
Tam-awan Village,"Although the place is small, there are people like Taiwan performing here. It ’s very interesting.Dance is almost XDDD like a nightclub like Golden KalalengIn addition, the chicken legs in the restaurant are delicious"
Tam-awan Village,Very relaxing and you can really see a glimpse of the native lives. It's just that it's hard to climb because it's all stairs and it's steep and slippery because there are rocks and moss. but all in all it's still a good place to visit
Tam-awan Village,A good place to take a stroll.
Tam-awan Village,nice place.. the food is delicious
Tam-awan Village,"A beautiful heritage village, I highly recommend visiting it"
Tam-awan Village,"👏👏👏👏👏 nice , it's a shame it was slippery when we went We didn't get to hike"
Tam-awan Village,"The place is okay. I just have your feet ready because there are many stairs HAHAHHAHAH. Lots of art works and plants, the area is small, so limit your expectations hehehe"
Tam-awan Village,The place is beautiful. It's good to go on a weekday so there aren't too many people. ❤
Tam-awan Village,"Enjoy being ready for a hike., Hahaha. There is a student tour guide if you want to assist"
Tam-awan Village,In case of rain or high humidity necessarily wear non-slip shoes. Interesting excursion point.
Tam-awan Village,to ngy😊 males
Tam-awan Village,"I love nature and Tam-awan is one of the places you can go to relax with adventure.And if you are an art lover, you will appreciate the painting collection they have."
Tam-awan Village,Love here
Tam-awan Village,Nice place to take a leisurely stroll.A place where you can have the feeling of a jungle for a while.
Tam-awan Village,"We hiked with senior citizen we were surprised to climb faster than us .. We were under estimate to mother ... It was easy to climb cases with a wet part ""the slippery slope"" hahaha .. The beauty of native houses seems I'm back in my teens .. Free!"
Tam-awan Village,"It's nice to go around here, although when I went there, there was absolutely nothing."
Tam-awan Village,"only three stars, because it is a bit far from Baguio town, and the views are limited, so it's not too good to climb the mountain because it's steep and tedious and it looks like nothing good can be seen at the top, just good to go because the paitings can be seen immediately. Also the huts, if you have time to wander around, it's okay to go to this place"
Tam-awan Village,It is very beautiful and has many beautiful adventures
Tam-awan Village,Postmodern style accommodation.A great experience for everyone who wants to experience something far away from normal accommodation and want to be close to nature. Also functions as an exhibition for regional artists.
Tam-awan Village,Tired of climbing the trail. Hope you have a gazebo or chair in VIewdeck 2 to relax. The railings would have been given to Viewdeck 2 because some of the older people would have climbed it but had stopped because it didn't seem to be in danger. (the disease bes)4 stars still due to ifugao huts and artworks.
Tam-awan Village,"A must visit place when in Benguet. There's a gallery if you're an art lover, there are groups of people performing indigenous Cordillera dances, and you can also try a little bit of hiking to complete the experience."
Tam-awan Village,The place is like a small furrowWhere the roads are very small wandering through it full of quarrelsOverall beautiful and terrible atmosphereFor those who are mainly located in Baki they deserve a visitThere is no foodEither if you cut a long distance do not recommend it
Tam-awan Village,"Even if you take a leisurely look around a section of the mountainside, the life of the indigenous people is reproduced in a course of about 30 minutes. There are original souvenirs not found in Baguio City."
Tam-awan Village,Beautiful
Tam-awan Village,Very colorful!))
Tam-awan Village,Very bad. The parking lot is muddy. It's always there. It's not always. It's advertised. Very risky
Tam-awan Village,Nature and art lovers will love the place. I am hoping to fix the defects or make it better for more to go.
Tam-awan Village,Several huts spread over the hill. Interesting descriptions. A bit of a climb. Pleasant experience.
Tam-awan Village,"A beautiful place, an old garden, a lot of beautiful things, and an opportunity to make a portrait for yourself in the tourist city of Baguio, Philippines"
Tam-awan Village,Happy PNK manga taga dating daan. Thank GodThe view is beautiful and it's my place to sleep free ercon

Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Interesting to look at, challenging to finish looking at unless you're used to trekking. There's much walking and climbing on both left and right sides, and it's not suitable for seniors. The angle of inclination for its slope appears to be retained as is that's why it's tough.The left side from the entrance uses a lot of stones and looks rural while the right side has lesser stones and is like a western-inspired castle exterior. If you choose the left side first, you'd get tired, so better to choose the right side first. It's the side with proper stairs and the tunnel with stones painted like gold. The statues on this side look nice.The left side has a way of sparking your imagination. There are also references to Philippine folklore on this side especially on the gods.What's bothered me on the stone side was the lack of safety precautions in the area. The fence is barely there and is quite flimsy, the stair stone steps tiny, and if you slip, that's a super long way down!This left side has the Igorot costume fitting for a fee of 50 pesos for pictorial and several good photo spots for the view.They also have official photographers in the area who print the photo for a fee of 250 pesos when we came to ask.It's worth a visit, but do take your time, it can't be climbed and finished so quickly if you're easily tired. Rushing this place would spoil the experience."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It was my first time here and I think it's a really nice place. It's great to see this amazing stone temple giving people some bits of history about the Igorot tribe. Good for picture taking but you must be brave enough to climb to the top to appreciate this beautiful picturesque.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I personally admired the effort put into constructing this kingdom of stone. They deserve the visit. We really enjoyed taking photos of the stone structures that appear like stair-like terraces. It gives you a glimpse of history of the Igorot communities. With the actual houses and garden, this is a must see!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The spot is still developing as it was made during pandemic. Some parts of it were not yet finished, workers are seen while visitors are in. The rate per person is 100 pesos. I think it’s a bit pricey but, it’s understandable as it is a privately owned tourist spot."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Entrance fee is Php100. Pretty crowded during the mid of the day. Great place to do a  hike.  A good place for photography because of it’s unique structure and architecture. After a 30-minute to an 1 -hour of walking, some variety of storesare available outside the kingdom for snack and drinks. A comfy pair of  shoes are advisable because there’s a lot of walking/hiking to see the other unique parts of the kingdom."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"View is beautiful. It is a stone throw tourist attraction from our relative's house so we went there as early as 7AM. Because the place gets packed by 8AM onwards, especially on holidays and weekends. Good for picture taking and learning bits about Igorot History. Entrance fee as of May 2022 is 100.00 per person. Parking space is a bit tight but there are few pay parking around. Transient houses are available near the area, too. Best to go as early as 6:30 AM so the place do not have much people yet."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Such an amazing sight to see! This place is built from stone, by hand I was told. I can’t imagine the time and hard work put into this location. This is a must see in Baguio if you have the opportunity. We stayed a couple of hours here and took some wonder pictures. Even as crowed as it was, people were polite and very patient. I would love to revisit here if I come back to Baguio."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Open, but few areas still under construction. Good to visit in the morning sunrise. Good for pictures but the same stone background everywhere just different structures.Few shaded areas and amenities."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A beautiful and a must visit place when you go to Baguio City. Kids and adults will surely love this place. Not advisable for senior citezens though especially to those who have difficulty walking  and climbing up and down the stairs. The place is not fully finished yet.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A very beautiful place. It gets too busy on weekends, rain or shine. I hope in they control the flow of people inside and remove the shops/stores from the highlight spots.Nevertheless, I will definitely come back."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is still under construction and the entrance fee is affordable. I would like to see specific routes on my visit (tourist movement was a bit chaotic last time). I would also like to see the stores moved out of the grounds and closer to the ticketing office so there's less crowding. Overall, it was a good experience, and I enjoyed learning more about the Igorot culture through the placards near the photo opp sites."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,If you are looking for a new place to explore in Baguio then this is the perfect place for you. Entrance fee is 100 for adults and 80 for kids. Foods and drinks are available inside. Best time to visit is during weekdays and in the morning when there are only a few tourists going there.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,we visited while the weather wasn't good so it's really a struggle can't take selfies cos it's raining especially the site is a wide open. my legs hurt from climbing the steep stairs—that's my own problem. the site is still on going. there's allotted time for tickets. you can buy raincoats if it's raining. there's street food inside—located at the top called sunset view. expect the parking is just alongside the road. restrooms are not that fine. but great experience!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"We visited when the place was engulfed in fog and it made it all the more surreal. It's like being in a historical fantasy movie.Although not yet completely finished, thus the 4 stars for room for improvement, it is a worthwhile place to visit. A bit of a climb but that's a given in Baguio. Could use a history gallery to highlight the pride and significance of the culture. All in all a good trip. Will revisit once thoroughly completed."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place to visit especially in the afternoon when it gets so foggy! The entrance fee is 100 for adults and 80 for children and senior citizen. kids 3 yrs old and below are free. They also offer food and drinks below the view deck. I hope that the place will always be well-kept.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"One of the new tourist attraction in La Trinidad, Benguet, amazing work of the local and some says it is handmade by themSome areas are still work in progressParking is one of the problem if you travel with your own car, drop-in and pick-up in front of the place is a good idea. Parking space inside and infront of the place is available but to limited upto 10-12 cars only. Parking space around the place is also available but due to the out-pouring tourist, you should have luck and good timing to park; parking along the road will get you a traffic violation ticket.Foods inside is available and also some outside"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is in development for further enhancements as of the moment of this review. Though that's the case the place is already great. Before entering the place you must pay the ticket fee first. 100 pesos for adults, 80 pesos for children and free for toddlers. After paying the ticket you need to show it to be stamped before you can enter. Inside the area, after entering through,you can have a picture with a big dog for a hundred (100.00) pesos per set which means per group or per person but many pictures can be taken - you need to give your phone to the photographer then have your friends or yourself, if you're alone, ready for the photo shoot. Food and drink stalls are available inside. You can also rent an igorot outfit for 50 pesos and have photo sessions inside the premises only - kindly return the outfit before you leave. There is also an amazing band - South America Bolivia, which plays a native flute together with several music pieces, kindly give him a tip or two if you please. It's a great experience. I haven't visited the igorot mine inside because I was so hungry and needed to eat and forgot about it 😅."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"This is one of the newer attractions in Baguio which highlights the stone-building skills of the Igorots. For a small fee, one could experience firsthand this marvel. Before entering, one could have a photo taken garbed in the Igorot costume complete with a headdress. Two giant statues of native Igorots are by the entrance. As a senior citizen, my climbing skills were challenged, so to speak 😂. Young people would love this place. One is afforded a truly exhilarating view on the upper tiers. This is a must-see when you visit."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice view especially from the top. You will be amazed by the structure and the story how it was built.Additional attraction when you visit Baguio....Would recommend that they put up some shelters when it rains or under the heat of the sun for quite some time....
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"₱100 entrance fee/ticketAs of today, I've read an article that it was ordered to closed over violations such as safety issues and operating with no business permit.Maganda sya kaso violation is a violation.And it's better to take action now bago pa may mangyaring masama. Ang dami pa naman ding bumibisita."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Though its man made but its also unique. People could flock and experience walking through stairs of stones and cement. Nice looking view down on people walking below.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"its just a fancy place with no account about history. just a way to rip off money from tourist. if you want to enjoy baguio. go in the outskirts of the city enjoy nature,, enjoy the natural parks"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A new tourist attraction in Baguio. It features the ancient rip-rap technology of the Igorots and the present day concrete retention wall approach. Intagramable and selfie/groupie spots. Php 100 pesos entrance fee. Php 80 pesos for seniors. You can rent the traditional Igorot  costume for 50 pesos for unlimited time. And take photos with it around the area. With minimal parking slots. Restrooms are available in the entrance lounge. Souvenir, street food snacks and strawberry and ube ice cream cart are available.  Expect climbing up and down as part of the experience."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Highly recommended place to visit when in Baguio. It adds to the common tourist spots that are overcrowded already. Just pray that the rain does not caught up with you as it may ruin your opportunity to get and capture great pictures of the place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The Igorot Kingdom just opened in June 2021 and if you are into hiking or walking, then this is definitely a pla there for you to start your tour in Baguio!Parking is difficult. Either infront of the attraction, roadside or at Petron (to which you have to walk back a around 280m with the cars right beside you).There are 4 attractions here: First, stone walls which was inspired by rice terrace;  second, the Igorot Gold Mine; steel bridge; and modern-day castles made of cement and hollow blocks. There are other on-going developments in the area.At the stone walls, the pathway is almost good for one person only and is a two-way path. Hopefully they improve the flow of people so as not to interrupt those moving up and going down from the top. It will be better to have a one-way system especially that people stop to take photos.The pathway around the modern day castle is wide enough to accommodate two-way system. A floor before the 360 overview is a mini canteen with refreshments. The over360 view was worth the steps! It was relaxing and refreshing."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Not for the faint hearted, there are ramps for parents wanting to bring their little ones on top yet uneven terrain makes the travel difficult. Be sure to wear RUBBER SHOES for comfort. The diner on top of the structure is just quail egg or kwek x2, drinks and snacks so don't expect lavish meals since you only paid for the scenery and view. My advice would be to go to the gray or castle like structure for a better view rather than the rocky side."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Place had a quite pleasant view. Though there will be alot of walking and climbing to the highest peak of the attraction it is worthwhile. You can also rent Igorot clothes costume then take a selfie to make you feel the vibe of being an Igorot even better. It is well maintained and as of our visit last March improvements still are on the way for more attractions. PS there was a food court on the almost top of the attraction on the right side peak :). Only problem you can encounter though when going weekends would be the parking as there might be alot of tourist nothingless all is good.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Looks okay but too crowded. Came here on a weekday but there are oh so many tourists. Some pathways are just too narrow for 2 people passing at the same time not to mention ongoing construction during visiting hours in the middle of the pathways which makes it more narrow. Also, some paths can be too steep for senior citizens. Andddd, it's so hard to take a decent photo. If you want to visit, they're open as early as 6am. Visit early to avoid the crowd. I wouldn't visit again unless maybe after the construction's finished or if they control the number of people inside. Entrance fee is 100 pesos."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Wonderful place to visit. So amazed on how they were able to build the stone structures. Just a heads-up that there is an entrance fee that we need to settle before we get in. A portion of it also allows you to have pictures with our native people, a dog and there is also a space where in you can ask for a hena tattoo session. On right side is likely a kingdom that has different windows os a castle then there is a bridge that connects to the left side of it where you will see the staircases of stones. Please be reminded that if we are bringing kids with us, make sure to always look after them to avoid accident's."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Love the view and the architectures. However, I heard from the news that they were closed down by the government as of November 9,2022. The same day we visited. Please double check before you visit."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Needs a lot of work. It will look good once it's fully finished. Hope they  will also fix the road since Baguio has a lot of rainfall and it will be muddy. Also entrance fee is a bit pricey
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Another new attraction in  Baguio. If you're planning to visit, be there early cause parking is limited. Entrance fee for seniors and and seniors are discounted and paid at the registration area. It features safety rails to assist visitors in climbing the stones. It features the skills of the igorots in building ripraps which is  much like the famous rice terraces. Its still a work in progress. More levels are still being added. One can rent igorot costumes for a fee. Be sure to wear sunblock before visiting."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,When youre looking for some cardio exercise in the City of Pines.There are better sites to visit in Baguio but this attraction boasts of its creativity and construction skills of locals.Parking space is limited and so is the public transport.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The Igorot Stone Kingdom offers a unique and beautiful concept. It’s one of the most attractive tourist spots in the city.  For 50 pesos, tourists may rent costumes and dress up like Igorots while sightseeing. Official photographers are also present in the area. You may claim your pictures near the entrance for 150 pesos."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Newly build and still under construction for the most part. It showcases the indigenous culture of Cordilleras, as well as the practices, traditions, values and way of life of its people. Insta worthy place.Let down is they should have finished the construction before opening it for the public, not a pleasant experience to walk in-between gravel-cement mixture. No proper signage to guide you thru the entire stone kingdom. Lack of dustbins, in the floor, rest area and almost everywhere you might see litters candy covers, chocolate covers, not the way to respect indigenous culture by polluting the place. They should add a guide for the tourists to get deeper understanding in the tradition, beliefs and to answer basic question  for the full experience and knowledge abt the culture.If you are travelling by taxi, make sure you will be leaving before 5pm as it is very hard to get a taxi or grab taxi after 5pm, as the place is kinda outside of the busy zone and the taxis that frequent this area is not that many.Ticket rates as of may 2022:Adult: 100 PesoChildren age 3-12: 80 PesoOverall a nice try and improvements can be done."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"With its gates opening in June 2021, the Igorot Stone Kingdom is one of the latest attractions in this part of Benguet.It is a man-made theme park that highlights the culture of the indigenous tribes in the Cordillera Region. According to owner Pio Velasco, this 6,000-square meter area is where he exactly saw a white carabao. He used it as an inspiration to build the structure there.The site is easily noticeable from a distance. It looks like a castle ruin from a bird’s eye view. The walls are made with stones interlocked together with cement for additional strength.The fully constructed parts of the attraction include the fertility tower as well as statues of Igorot legends Kabunyan, Gatan, and Bangan. There’s also a section that depicts a gold mine, a steel bridge, and a modern-looking castle. You can have a photo taken with the resident Igorots there.At the top of the castle is a canteen-like store where you can buy food and refreshments. There are also stalls selling goods and pasalubong.As of August 2022, there are still parts under construction, so you could expect more life-sized statues and other features soon. Regardless, tourists still flock to this destination, especially during weekends. It’s best to visit the place on a weekday morning to avoid the rush of visitors.This new bucket list item is located along Longlong Road in Pinsao Proper, roughly five kilometers from the city’s center. It’s also a stone’s throw away from the Tam-awan Village.Aside from taking a private vehicle, you can get here via jeepney by riding the Longlong- or Tam-Awan-bound jeep from Kayang Street. However, taking a taxi, Grab, or InDriver ride is more convenient.Getting back to the city proper is a bit challenging. There’s a queue outside the attraction for passengers needing a taxi ride back.The Igorot Stone Kingdom is open every day, from 6 AM to 6 PM. Here’s the list of entrance fees:Adults (at least 13 years old): P100Children (4-12 years old): P80Kids (3 years old and below): FreeSenior citizens and PWDs get a discount."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Entrance fee is costly,   what you see is what you get , in photo and in actual..  No particular superb in this place,  too crowded  because its the new attraction  here in bagiuo..  But again no extravagant  feature,  only they said that the true history  of igorot stone house was vanished  sometime ago.  . And know they just remake it.√® i paid my entrance  fee,  i rated based on my experience. 😊"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A lot of families visit this place... you can rent  set of native costume and have your pictures taken.Worth the price of entrance (P100/pax).
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"❌ Entrance Fee is quite expensive. P100 per adult!✔️ Igorot Flute Man is really great. Watch him play and spare some tip please!✔️ Mom loved this place. She was amazed so yeah. 😅Note: As of Dec. 26, 2021, some facilities are not yet finished."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Good site for pictures, unique place to visit...still under construction...owner of place wanted to show physically what it was like during those days....if completed we will go back and check God willing"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"They say that there is life in stone. I agree. This huge monument of stones is breathtaking. Although it is new, but the history is old and alive. The architecture is somewhat similar to Indonesia."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,An awesome place to visit with loved ones. I love how peaceful the place is especially in the morning. It made me appreciate more the hard working people of the highland. A must visit place for nature lover 💚🌳  ⛰
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Igorot Stone Kingdom is one of the newest attraction in Baguio. Very Instagram-worthy and this is the place where your hd widescreen cameras gets handy because of their 360° views are picture perfect.There are also budget-friendly stores around for souvenirs and picture taking ( Php50.00 unli shots)The other stone kingdom where there are restrooms and food stalls are stroller friendly.

Commuting is easier since taxis are always present in the area.Nearby places includes the Tam-Awan Village which is walking distance from this place."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Parking is kind of hassle coz you will be called out via mega mic when there's parking issue. And more hassle, if you happened to be at the top.They have 100 pesos entrance fee.The steps are slippery and not recommended for wheelchair."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I got amazed with the story telling behind its construction and the vision on how this project  would go about. Stop by and read the signage around, its educating and beautifully worded that easily captures the imagination.Be awed with the  igorot workmanship and creativity at the Igorot Stone Kingdom"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It is what it is. This is basically just a roadside attraction.  It looks cool, but there's really no historical significance.  It was constructed because ""On this site on March 1,2020 a white carabao appeared before Pio G. Velasco (Igorot name: Bagowan).""It does have some pretty good street food. Also, as others have mentioned,  parking is a huge challenge."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"This place is recently built on baguio, i think its 95% done but there is still some construction on going, a good place to visit and you can climb at the very top of the castles I like it in here even if its kinda tiring because of all the climb we need to do, also there is like a caves or places with notes on it about some history or ancient gods of mountain tribes."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Nice but it's not finished yet.Also to add, very limited parking space. So you have to resort to nearby private parking spaces that will charge you 100 pesos."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place was really nice. Sobrang daming tao lang that time na pumunta kami. There are still some construction inside and outside the place. The food was kinda expensive for it's size and qty, and sana expand yung place for eating."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Stone. Stone. Stone everywhere. Well, it's a Stone kingdom--- it shows the brief culture of the igorots and one thing I love in this place is their pasalubong area(where they aCcepted our gcash payment cause we're out of cash lol) and my friends enjoyed climbing it, they also have a cafe in the new building. You can check it out, it's a breath of fresh air. The entrance fee is 100php."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Igorot Stone Kingdom. Located in Baguio City.This is a nice place to stop by. You can rent Igorot traditional clothing for only PHP50.Climb into the Top to experience overlooking view. There is also a Cafe and Snack bar on the Top.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It is still under development but the place is already spectacular. It is the top place I recommend when visiting the highlands of Baguio and Benguet. It is one of the works of my kababayan (kailyan) that I am proud of. It has a taste of the rich culture of us Igorots. Our first visit here was actually raining and it was so thoughtful that they have given us free entrance tickets of which we used during our recent visit of this place. Enjoy barbeque and street foods located at the top most part of this park. Value for the entrance fee (P100php for adult I think) is 5/5. Parking can accommodate many cars. Enjoy your stay and hope you will like it.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It is good... But this month June 2022 there are still renovation happening insidw the Stone kingdom. If you want to buy food, there are stores but make sure to prepare enough allowance. The entrance fee costs 100 pesos and the parking lot too."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Great workout if you are into climbing stairs while enjoying the view. Entrance fee is affordable and you can buy souvenirs here.We learned so much about the life of the igorot tribe, wish that the local government will continue to support this attraction and develop signages and other amenities."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Place is still under active development. Smaller in actual vs pictures but is no less than a beaut to visit.Just be wary that you can get exhausted just by climbing up the area. lol.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Really admired the effort put into constructing this kingdom of stone. They deserve the interest of people visiting Baguio.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Looking for a new place? Visit ISK. newly made. Place is still under construction but view is nice. Expect more visitors. 100 pesos fee for adults and 80 pesos for kids.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"New attraction to go. Since it's new, expect a lot of tourists. Good thing there were authorities outside to mitigate the crowd."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"You'll have to take a lot of staircases so it's better to wear comfy shoes and clothes. It's kinda hard to go here on a rainy day, and it's extra windy, so you better bring a rain coat than an umbrella."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Just stones and shops. Not much history here. Most are fantasies made real by the owner. It's great exercise though for 100 pesos. Slippery when wet. Limited parking and always packed with people.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I don't know if they have the map of the place, on going construction of the site.Railings are too thin, unlike in Mirador. So be careful and do not lean on it."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It was good, though construction is being done on both sides but is not affecting the flow of people that much. Great for taking pictures"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice structural designs~ although we didn't see the view bec of the fog. Lots of photo op and also pet-friendly!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Very nice place to go, you can see Cultural beliefs and traditional attire that can wear for picture taking. 100.00 entrance fee is worth the experience ☺️"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Great place. Breathtaking view. Great architecture. Need to work on more and fix the rest rooms. There's only one for the whole place and you get thousands of tourists everyday. Parking is a bit of a challenge and arriving here is a bit of a headache due to the congestion. There's a noticeable lack of public transport in the entirety of Baguio and is mostly populated by taxis.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Amazing architecture, two different styles of castle, love the view and weather, ooohh the fog! 100 pesos entrance fee per head, a bit crowded though"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A new attraction at Baguio City. A man-made Igorot Stone Kingdom still with a ticket worth of 100 pesos. Despite there being some ongoing construction in the said place, the area is still worth it for your instagram."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It’s not recommended for wheelchair/ senior citizen who hardly to walk, since lots of stair to going up.Entry ticket: ₱100 for adult, ₱80 senior, kids below 4 are freeThe place is so crowded and there is picture station who will gave us some props for free (only donation)."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Great! Some work is being done when we visited. Really impressive as it seems that every rock/stone is custom-shaped by hand.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Too crowded place but still we enjoyed staying there. I’ve seen like these place before when i was still working in saudi arabia.Nice place’nice people too👌🏼😊
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"100 pesos per head entrance fee. It's a gem in the middle of a residential area. Not recommended for people with weak knees. Ive noticed that there is a ramp for PWDs which is great. Pero available lang sya sa loob and not sa entrance so idk how they are going to get inside. Parking space are limited. There is a small cafe and eatery at the top. Overall, it's very beautiful."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Awesome man made structure. Beautifully arranged all the things. Little bit describe about igorot people . 100 peso enterace fee per person
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"1) terrible car park attendant, had my 5month old kid and a senior getting off the car , and he just said to hurry it up on a serious tone or put the car on the other side where there is traffic in between, he even was bragging about having a feast fight! tried to report to the admin he just brushed it off....2) P 100 entrance not that cheap so be ready to shell some money3) no parking space , better to go there on a taxi or better yet dont go at all , not a picturesque place.....since this is a private institution customer service should be a premium ...... wont recommend this place at all"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not pleasant at all. It's a private spot wherein it was created purely for business. Nothing special except to climb the stairs that lead to the topmost level of these man-made stone terraces. Everything is for a fee. Very small parking and food are expensive.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The creativity and craftiness of the builders are commendable. Better to visit this place in summer to enjoy the 360 view.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,When in Baguio:Visited the Igorot Stone Kingdom. One of the recently added tourist spots in Baguio. Rich in history. Great for uphill downhill walking but one must have good stamina lol.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Glad to know this place was built as a safe space for Igorots and to showcase their amazing building prowess. Definitely a must-see attraction in Baguio.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Definitely, creative. A bit unsafe due to protruding metals. Construction is ongoing without warning signs. Date of visit May 5, 2022."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A new tourist destination that tells about Igorot folklore and showcases the locals' rock-laying skills. The park covering a 6,000-square meter area features the Igorot ingenuity in creating stone walls similar to the rice terraces in Battad, Banaue."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The scenery and construction are amazing....bravo to the architects, engineers and all who are part of creating the Igorot Stone Kingdom."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Update Sept 22: I stopped by this place today. It still looks much like a construction site from the inside. I am forever baffled how local governments can approve opening attractions that are still construction sites. 1) Railings throughout are a joke, were not even installed or are temporary rebar. There must not be any regulation on what a railing should be in a venue with many fall opportunities, esp for children. 2) this venue does not appear to have ANY connection to Igorot anything accept the owner (Private owner braggs he had a dream he would be rich, so he installed a huge tourist trap, BTW not supporting anything nobel but his pockets) is apparently Igorot. The few already badly faded and worn signs claiming to make connections to Irogot heritage are a side show. 3) This is nothing more then a Disney-fied Instagramable bunch of rocks emulating some kind of European Castle aesthetic.  4) Finally, i would bet they don't report honest revenue to BIR. You don't get a receipt. They issue the whole ticket from a book. There are no ledgers or registers. Tickets are preferated but the gate takes the whole ticket. They go in a big box. Nice to burn, so there is no record of any sales anywhere. Please don't waste your 100 pesos. Have lunch at Farmer's Daughter and move on! See some art at Tamawan. For real don't waste your tme here!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Igorot Stone Kingdom.They have this food court. Unfortunately, they dont serve their local cuisine, which he indicated his favorite bean stew. How i wish they serve this gastronome art in this place.update: i found an eatery where you can find the Pork and bean but without the pork mentioned.As per my palate, the taste is interesting. I havent tsted it before, in my opinion its a must try if you go to Baguio, also this is where the best tasting Adobong Puso ng saging according to my senses.The kitchen can be found just beside the Baguio Townhouse condomiun. ""Mama Dins Bulalohan at kambingan sa kanto"""
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A nice place but not advisable to elders. Theres a coffee shop on the top that serves merienda, and a small eatery at the entrance."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I enjoyed being here and you will pay 100 for entrance fee, less 20 for kids. If you like to experience the stone filing by igorot and Igorot culture and environment. This is a yes-yes suggestion!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,So many people means it is a famous place since it is also a new attraaction to baguio city. The entrace fee is okay. Even though its still nit finnish but it still looks fabulous and safety to roam around .
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Place is really nice. A bit far lang sya sa baguio proper. I suggest na magdala bg car coz public transport in this area is not that easy. Hehehh. Though there are few taxi's naman. You just need to wait.Di pa tapos yung place when we went there. But youll see already how beautiful the place is.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New place to visit in Baguio. 15 to 20 mins away from Sm Baguio. Must visit this romantic place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Its a very nice place many tourist even it's under construction still you can enjoy the view very accommodating people they have.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The php100 is not really worth it because the place is not yet finished. However, the place is nice because it has postings about the history of Igorot’s."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Awesome stack of rocks with igorot statues.With cafe/canteen on the top and a viewing deck.Crowded when we came here (Saturday Afternoon)We came here with a cab but I noticed that parking area is small.P100 entrance fee for adults.Update: Nov 9 it is closed due to permit and safety issues.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It is still half done. The right side is still being constructed as of this moment but still worth your time.Just a few reminders:- few minutes away from Session rd/SM but can be longer due to traffic.- Situated beside a four-lane main road and a cause of traffic.- Parking space is very limited.- Jeepneys are available by chance and you need to guard your taxi before somebody else will take it from you.- Entrance fee for adults is ₱100.00.- Be careful of the rocks.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"So majestic & artistic. What a great idea, how lovely, isn't it? Well anyway, this place is perfect for your Baguio tour because it is near in tam-awan village, just a few walk ayaw.. There they are, my awesome guest all the way from bicol.. #Boy Bagito"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Beautiful View 🌁Nice weather❄Its like you're in the other country🌏
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Awesome place. A must not miss to visit place. Although parking is limited, the place is absolutely awesome."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New place to visit in Baguio. Quite far from the metro and entrance fee is kinda expensive knowing that area could be roam around in less than 30min.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's a nice place to visit. Construction and improvements on going at the moment. Nice view. Will go back again. You will be mesmirized and amazed on how they constructed it.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Incomplete and lots of people visiting daily. Didn’t stay long. Seems covid is too great a threat
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Super great place nice to see how the Igorot people do the place making more beautiful and more attractive to invite people to visit the place, for me salute to Igorot people"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Place is nice but they are not yet done constructing some areas so some areas are not yet photo-friendly 😁.For the future visitors, please be decent and have some respect, DON'T VANDALIZE!!!!When we went there we saw names written somewhere at the castle-like area!Please take only pictures, and leave only footprints! Imagine if every visitor will leave their names on the walls, that will be an eyesore!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A supposed-to-be picturesque place that got visually marred by a thick fog throughout our afternoon visit. But it is a good place to visit.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"One of the new attractions in Baguio. Entrance fee costs 100 per adult and 80 for children. Parking can be a challenge. Parking fees cost P25 for each car. The place has ongoing construction as of July 2021. If you're up for hiking and don't mind some skin-scorching, this place is okay. Otherwise, it is not worth visiting. There are still inaccessible areas due to construction. Food options are overpriced. Structures are all man-made and not historic. Social distancing is not well-enforced. Can get very inconvenient and even dangerous when it's raining."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place. Not much to do but take pics. So instgrammable.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Entrace fee is overpriced. Too much commercial, to less focus on Igorot culture and history. Good for photos."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"They were charging 100 pesos for regular adults and 80 pesos for seniors. A bit pricier than other Baguio tourist spots. Inside, the stone structure was impressive. I only went to one side, the finished side, of the kingdom. I was not confident in the structural integrity of the other half. It looked unfinished and it was just simple cement. Now it was closed by the city for not having a permit. Hoping they will fix their papers and finish the site. It was great for photos."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This is a man made park and one of the most tourist attractions in Baguio City. This Igorot Stone Kingdom is a rock laying skills of the Igorots.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A park that showcases Igorot culture, practices, and traditions as well as the life of the denizens of the Cordillera region. The owner's concept is an Igorot child's fantasy of castles, his childhood in Mountain Province, the stories about the first Igorot people, man's belief that there is a caring God, and the culture of the family accentuated by the Igorot's skillful hands of stone laying. Among the main attractions at the stone kingdom is a tower that depicts the fantasy story of Gatan and Bangan, an Igorot man and woman who survived the great holocaust, a fertility stone tower, and a Kabunyan (Igorot God) tower. The park is a representation of the new and old Igorot culture and values of the Cordillera people. Then we can see some proud Igorot playing local musical instruments which are so entertaining to see. They showcase their dexterity as artisans and entertainers. The wonderful visitors are having fun at the park. From distance, we can see an underground and a bridge which is a picturesque view. For this reason, we take many pictures and videos at the top. Indeed it is one of the must-visit places in Baguio City."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The journey to this place is so exciting... You may feel tired but the experience is incredible😊
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's a unique experience to be here while eating strawberry ice cream in the Baguio cold weather is

Igorot Stone Kingdom,"New tourist attraction to visit while in baguio, amazing work of craftsmanship but its not yet fully done they are still in the process of doing some part of it"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"although it ain't complete yet when I visited, it is amazing to look at already. very accessible by commute if you will be coming from baguio town, only 1 jeep away, fare at 15php"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Nothing special, maybe it's more beautiful if it has more colors. Entrance fee is 100 and you will have free 1year pass because it's still under construction."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is clean, though it is under construction during our visit. There's food in the area. Best time to visit in the morning. Entrance fee is kind a expensive though for just a castle and stone."

Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The concept is new and the place is fascinating. It's just that, it's still under construction. The path is slippery when wet."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Amazing artworks by the igorots. Hoping for a good and affordable food and coffee if completely done. Nice if they make neat & clean comfort rooms.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's very astonishing and attractive place. It will give you a different experience. If you are visiting there then you should have at least 2 hours to enjoy the full place. Some part is still under construction. Entrance fee is 100 peso
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Nice stepped and elevated place, for selfie and group pictures!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The entrance fee is unreasonable since there is nothing to do inside but take pictures. A minute after the initial shock of what the place looks like, I was over it. I didn't even want to go up the stairs if it wasn't that I have an energetic 8 yr old boy that wants to see every crevice of the place. If you had seen it once, it is not something you would want to view again."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New attraction in Baguio. Dreamy and foggy. Enjoyed taking photos. Great experience!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Interesting tourist trap, great photo opportunity, good workout to walk around.A bit crowded, a little bit not child friendly since there's a lot climbing and possible places to easily fall if you don't watch your kid attentively.Very little parking though on-site so be prepared to hunt for a (pricey) parking spot in the nearby areas..."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Always crowded but it's fine since there's still places where you can sit down, rest and just enjoy the view.Too expensive for 100pesos and if you think about how many people go to this place maybe they really shouldn't be asking for more money on the used of costume like it should be included with the 100. But I guess people who do rent out the costume and sell stuff inside pays a for their stall or something.Maybe make it more worth your money kind of place."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Unique view and good for people who love the view of nature because u can see everything when your on the top of the igorot stone
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New attraction in Baguio with 100 pesos each entrance. THEY opens by 6am
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It was easy to find, the placd looks really cool, they are still developing the place, friendly people, you have to pay for the entrance for 100 pesos. You can also rent the Igorot clothing. Wear your comfortable shoe or walking shoe. It was kinda slippery to the other side."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Loved the place, the way the maintained and still taking care of it is good. Definitely worth a visit, rented indigenous clothing to take pictures and returned them back.An entry fees is to be paid per person."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Awesome place for pictures & stair climbing fitness exersize
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Good place to visit.Parking: look for nearby parking rental.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Additional features ongoing.. It's worth to visit. Better be prapared with water and lot of energy.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Interesting architecture. Just prepare your knees as you will go up. Nice view on top. Also, its better to go early as the parking spot gets easily full and to avoid crowding as well."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Amazing handiwork of the people of the cordillera. Great architecture, it may not be completed yet but you can  enjoy and appreciate how amazing it woould be when the works are completed.Better to come early  as early as 6am to avoid the influx of visitors/ tourists, limited parking space and if you arrive at the middle of the day it would be congested with people."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The kingdom is expanding adding more stones on the right side.. better visit this place around 3PM onwards to avoid crowds and appreciate the view of course.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Some of the areas are still under renovation on our visit but overall the place is a good tourist attraction
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice view and infrastructure. It's just crowded when we go there. Maybe because of the holiday.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I love this place so much..sulit ang 100 pesos entrance fee for adult and 80 pesos for children 4 years old to 12 years old..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The new tourist spot in baguio..its so amazing..luv it!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A good place for pictures. You can also rent igorot costumes.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"There is an indigenous creativity here. This place was probably borne out of the more than a year of lockdown by its maker. It is indeed amazing to see adjoining mountain slopes practically layered with stone walls on one side and concrete slabbed walkway that leads to a viewdeck on one side. In summation, this place is absolutely a must see when you happen to travel to this part of the country."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Igorot Stone Kingdom is one of the unique place we have ever been here in Philippines. I may say that we can be proud of our culture and natural resources. Travel now and visit this place not just because of the beautiful scenery but also the people are so loving, friendly and accommodating.Although it is still undergoing some improvements but still the place is amazing. This is a must visit if you will be going to Baguio City , Philippines."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Tiring but worth it because of the stones, hand rails can be improved to a much tougher one."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,What a historic man made structure. This is one  enermous beauty of man's  craftsmanship!. It exibits the igorots tenacity and pure craftsmanship. 5 stars!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is great. But there is no good resting area or shed especially when there is rain.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Might not have been a realistic stone kingdom but still facinated at how they come up with the idea and a touch of modern kingdom look.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"There were many people, and most of them were rowdy, undisciplined, not socially distancing, and not wearing masks like there was no covid or like the government wasn't mandating it when we were there last April 2022. Too bad because the place itself was interesting. The fog and views from the top were worth the climb. Limited parking."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It’s a great tourist destination in Baguio but the line of cars, vans and taxis going to that place is not worth the hassle.We’re lucky we got the chance to get there as early as 8:00 in the morning.Pro tip: When going to different attractions in Baguio, and you have the time from 7:00 - 9:00 am in your Itinerary, place the busiest places in that time frame. That could be Igorot Stone Kingdom, Strawberry Farm and Mines View."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Amazing place to enjoy relax have fun and hiking from bottom to top. And see the beautiful views around. Architectural designs are unique,stones they use."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It always looks good on pictures and hearsays but up front in personal it's a little underwhelming, the amount of people here and line queue for picture is a little unbearable"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Php 100 Entrance Fee (Sept 2022). Nice place to take pictures.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Beautiful tourist spot in Baguio I love it   
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Amazing construction of stone. Much more than ever expected this place is very big with two sides one all stones and one more of a cement construction.  We enjoyed very much. Recommend you go there and be prepared to walk a lot.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,An Igorot stone kingdom was A man made tourist attraction
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"EDIT: It’s CLOSED due to “permit and safety issues” until further notice. You may search it on Google.The place is good for picture-taking but we will not come back. There’s nothing special about it, in our opinion."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very cool place. Love it
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Good experience and beautiful views.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I.had fun w/ nieces..un pla ang igorot stone kingdom😍..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Entrance fee of 100php is a bit high for the place
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Place is very nice.But the entrance fee is too much (Php 100)Unfortunately, when we go there the fog is too thick and we cannot see that much.There is also limited parking space in the area (motorcycle parking is Php20)There is also food stalls outside and a cafe in the inside (on top of the building)"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"One of its kind. Make sure to go early for parking, because if it’s full, the properties beside it offer parking but they charge 100. Not wheelchair or stroller friendly though."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,How amazing is this kingdom built by Igorot from matching stones with little use of cement
Igorot Stone Kingdom,made only for tourists and money.  a lot of tourists.  I don't like these places
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's a good place though not much to see. Just stones and a lot of slope climbing. The place is still not finished when I got there, there were a few construction happening around."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Expectations versus reality. The place was teeming with people when we went there. It is hard to take a good photo of the STONE kingdom. May have some safety issues as there were scaffoldings in one area. Young children should not be left unsupervised.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Its a nice place for picture taking. Though its not advisable for old persons like our lolo s and lolas since there are a lot of walking and going up upstairs. There are food stalls before the entrance as well as food stalls at the upper part of the place. Entrance fee is 100 pesos for adults and 80 pesos for children. Though its hard to look for parking spaces and the parking fee is 100 pesos which is a little bit expensive considering that its open parking and has no roof. WARNING! YOU REALLY NEED TO PARK IN DESIGNATED PAY PARKING AREA SINCE WHEN WE WENT THERE LAST NOV. 1 I HAVE SEEN LOTS OF TRAFFIC ENFORCERS ISSUING TICKETS OR REMOVING PLATE NUMBERS FOR THOSE WHO DONT WANT TO PAY THE 100 PESOS PARKING FEE AND HAVE PARKED ILLEGALLY AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It wasca nice experience seeing those stones turned into something beautiful. However, since they are charging an entrance fee of Php100 (hope for a more reasonable price) they should improve the restrooms/ comfort rooms."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Still under progress... yet very promising tourist destination.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"New attraction for tourists, construction still in progress."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Lots of art and craft, so beautiful"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice new place and attraction in Baguio with 100 pesos entrance fee. There are paid parking spaces near the site but the one we got costed us 100pesos per vehicle. This is also close to the Tam Awan Village.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,On going construction/renovation of the beautiful place. Added attraction are the Igorots and St. Bernard dog. Be ready with your entrance fee.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Unique setting and good story behind the structure
Igorot Stone Kingdom,If you want to relax just visit igorot stone kingdom located at baguio city
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"This park also represents the creativity and rich heritage of the Igorots. It is said that the Igorots are skillful in balancing stones and creating sturdy structures. Aside from these representations, the Igorot Stone Kingdom shares valuable histories and backgrounds about their colorful culture. The Igorot Stone Kingdom is one of the newest man-made attractions in Baguio.Entrance Fee:Adult: P100Kids/Senior: P80"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Some part of the place was still under construction.  Enjoyed taking a photos at the main entrance but thats it. If you do not like climbing and walking a lot then this is not the place for you.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Beautiful but too crowded.not good for seniors
Igorot Stone Kingdom,One of the best new places to go in Baguio!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The best you can go and take pictures
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I rate only 1 star because I never been there inside. Temporarily closed at this time. The jeepney drivers told me it was closed since November 2022. For those who wanted to visit there please check first if the place is open.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Unique, not congested, you can take all pictures that you can as long as you have a big, memory on your phone and DLSR, showcasing the rich culture, very accessible either taking a PUV, Taxi's, our your own private car, you can buy snacks, drinks and souvenirs."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"This place is really something. The Stone Kingdom, with an area of 6,000 square meters surrounded by tall trees and created resembling rice terraces, was built by Pio Velasco. This opened June of last year 2021 and immediately became a huge hit."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Enjoyed much. Proud Igorota.Igorot Stone Kingdom is a representation of how our ancestors had protected the nature, how they work hard and as a team build"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It has no cultural significance to Baguio. It's a mere  stone age rock theme park. Don't waste your time. Go to the nearby Tam- awan Village.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's fun actually, maybe that place keeps you a memories with your families, friends,  someone and etc. Although it's not finish yet but yeah it's fun. Me as half igorot I introduce to you to visit are Igorot Stone Kingdom."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's looks fabulous the original stone carving is so beautiful, but now there were making concrete building on side which looks so dual and ruining the beauty of original one, as still work was going on may be after finishing the work it's will look nice"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Although some parts are still under construction, The family enjoyed the place. Nice place for taking photos. Igorot culture."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Ok for kids I guess. This is about as fake as it comes. All the statues are plastic and the whole thing seems contrived with a complete lack of igorot presence (apart from vendors hiring igorot dress for 50 pesos).  The fake ""castle"" may appeal to kids who can pretend they are kings and queens.The cafe at the top of the ""castle"" is ok and offers turon, cheese sticks, kikiam at 20 pesos a piece. Sadly there was no BBQ left"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Beautiful piece of work but other than that, it’s just some rocks and stones stacked up together, in some standards, this may fail due to some safety reasons like railings and other caution signs particularly to the little bridge across."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Enough space for the number of tourists with kind and helpful staff
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place and IG Worthy posts!Affordable entrance fee too!Prepare for short climbs though. 😇😂😅
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Place is best to visit if you visit other locations around the area like farmer's daughter and the village. However, the structures doesn't give the IP vibes due to roman and european archi structures. Place is still on ongoing improvement. You can get a picture of the St Bernard dog stationed there or you can dress up as a native. Make sure to grab either strawberry or ube flavored taho at the entrance."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Great view and we only climbed one half of the whole place. The place can get a bigger in the future because of ongoing construction.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It literally is made if stone. Its better if you visit the place during dry season. It has its own parking but its is too high to climb for common cars. Neighboring parking costs Php 100.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,See for yourself beautiful stone structures made by Baguio's Local Residents...Entrance fee at 100 pesos per person.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Just an amazing display of native art/architecture!  Pictures I'd seen prior to visiting cannot do justice to the enormity of this place!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Parking is very limited. Other parking costs PHP 100. Not very encouraging to bring own Car.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Perfect only for Commuters there are no Parking Lot for Tourist and the Police Outside are Vigorous to Apprehend all the Vehicles Outside the Stone Kingdom...😡😡😡😡
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Another bucket list you can add when you visit the summer capital of the Philippines - Baguio City. Something new to enjoy. Entrance fee is a bit costly which is 100 for adult and it tends to be a bit crowded during weekends. It would be best to visit this place during weekdays and in the morning. There's also a cafe on top of it which you will enjoy the full scenery of the place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The stone constructed amazinglyCozy surroundingsQuite a bit crowded during our visit because it was 12nn. If  you plan to make a visit I highly recommend to get there early to enjoy the area and for sure you will gonna get the best shoot for Instagram  😉
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Place is good for pictures, you can pay for an igorot atire for like 50php, and donate money to booths and real igorots for a picture"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice view but the parking fee is to much 100 pesos flat rate
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's one of the nicest attraction in Baguio. Must visit. Built in mostly white stones.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This new park is awesome and spacious. Another site that must be enjoyed while in Baguio furlough.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,What to expect? E di stones! 😁👍
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"For 100 pesos entrance fee, sulit naman since okay ung view even if construction still on going. Instagramable place din. Medjo crowded lang when we went there."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,On going construction. Expensive entrance fee.. good place for picture taking especially if you have the time and energy to go higher and capture the whole development. Igorot costume as well available in cheaper price.Nov. 2021
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Mainit, go here early so youll have parking space. Make sure you have energy coz its mostly climbing and more climbing. Better if you have your own water. Entrance is 100p for adults and 80 for kids, 3yo below is free"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Still a work in progress. Crowd control should be better.Picturesque area.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Another tourist attraction in Baguio. There is a ₱100 entrance fee for adult and ₱50 for children. You need to have energy when you visit this place because it's going up. The architectural is nice and you have to photograph the place in landscape to appreciate. There are some food stalls inside selling strawberry flavored taho and ice cream and fresh strawberry.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Amazing manmade tourist spot i’ve ever seen, can’t imagine how long did they build it"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Igorot Kingdom. The place was just new and under construction. Typical story of the Igorot's culture and means of living which is gold mining.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Great spot for photos. Still under construction but looking good. Will come back after a year or two.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very accommodating and amazing place to explore everyday nice place to view it
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Great for tourism, try it when you are here in baguio, enjoy the view and have fun."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I think this place is a total ripoff for its entrance price. Sure, it's affordable but comparing its rates from other spots this place is a total ripoff. It's not even finished. First reaction is it's like from the medieval period and not an Igorot kingdom. Nice to see just for curiosity and for the experience of coming here."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Love it but it is not finished yet I hope that it will be finished when we go there again.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New place to visit in Baguio. Still in the process of conatructing the upper part of the structure.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is so relaxing to visit. Inside the place has a milk tea shop located at the very top.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I really like the way they built the place. Great experience
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Too crowded,100 per pax. For pictorial its not worth it. Visit as early as you can"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place to visit. Still have areas under construction but there is enough to take nice pictures as remembrance. They could improve safety especially at heights. Good thing it was not running when I went. Be careful if it rains. Must be super slippery in some areas
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This is an athletic challenge and worth a visit. I wish they can improve (as they are still constructing) and maintain it well. I hope it does not end up all faded and forgotten-looking as the coloured houses on the hill.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place and the structures.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A nice place to visit when you’re in Baguio. Sml but cultural.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Well we didn't get to see inside but I think it's once of the good place to do photographing specially at late afternoon to dusk.  Oh and maybe a little bit cheaper entrance fees
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I visited the place 3 times.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Overhyped. Nothing's special. Clearly they just built rubbles and called it a ""tourist spot."" A best seller for tasteless pinoy tourists. Cringy."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,So beautiful and it amaze me makes me think that how did they made this beautiful creation.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It’s a new tourist spot in Baguio.. still under construction.It tells a story about The IGOROTs.. beautiful place to visit.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Amazing structure hope will last but be careful coz i don't think there's any engineering calculation in here
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Do it on weekdays. Not worth it. Not for the old with achy knees. Traffic so heavy. Just went there awhile ago. Its Saturday.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not yet finished. The view were great
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is amazing as well as the story behind it. If you can, visit this place on a weekday to avoid the crowd. Don't go here hungry and weak because you'll be walking a lot. If you're lucky to be here on a nice and quite foggy weather, your trip to the top will definitely be worth it."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The entrance fee is bit expensive. The experience is okay but is not value for money. Parking is a bit small and can be tricky for car maneuvers, especially if the parking is almost full."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A unique place to have instragramable photo. Good to visit when not raining because there is no shed to stay if it's raining. Prepare also for entrance and parking fees.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Construction is not yet complete but nice view. Best to go on weekdays so fewer people.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This place is nothing but a heaped of stones put together like riprap and some as stone cladding on a big place. There are stores inside that do not add beauty to the place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A good place to take a picture and chill with friends/family It has 100Php entrance fee for every person, its fine but foods and souvenirs inside are expensive"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,* a new place to visit* great manual work* real stone work* good exposure to some highland culture and arts
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's not everyones idea of ""Stone Kingdom, a glorified copy if battlements very cleverly done, but you need to be fit and patient to go all around. In my opinion better suited as a playground for kids, there is nothing, in my opinion, warrants the title of "" Kingdom"""
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Beautiful places,i will be back soon"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This place is not 100% complete as of March 2022 but promises to be another good tourist destination in Baguio City. There is an entrance fee of 100 pesos per head. Parking may not be enough especially during peak season.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Igorot stone kingdom is so beautiful to see,, it's amazing,.."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Terrible rip-off built on a delusion. You walk around and climb up stony stairs to see nothing, but bad views and ugly souvenirs. Worst of all, it is built on a delusion of a kingdom, doing history and culture a disservice. The Cordilleras were tribal lands, never unified under a ""kingdom."" Kids are bound to believe this moneymaking false news."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The experience is one of a kind but it still need minor improvements.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Nice place to visit and to have a bit of exercise in going up hehehehe, its about 90% on its finishing touches, but its open to the public already...."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Igorot Stone Kingdom is such a nice place, with good view and also good people around. I really enjoyed my little minute of time visiting this place cause it's really worth it. Traveling from Solano Nueva Vizcaya is really an exhausted Travel but really worth it when we arrived at Baguio.You can also visit Igorot Stone Kingdom in the Province Of Benguet...I tell you, your long travel would be worth it.😊You can also enjoy the view with your favorite street food and your favorite person😍Yiee.."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Was able to climb up to top of the kingdom. The view was very rewarding! Definitely coming back here.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,They display the art of stone showcase the artistry of Cordilleran stone walling. It also showcase the culture and practices of the place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's an amazing creation of their tribes craft making beautiful and astonishing building out of stone. This really captures my heart❤❤❤
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Still inder construction, but views are outtstanding, php 100 entrance fee during our visit aug 20, 2022 ... This is promising site in the future .... Cheap souvineers too"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,brand-new ancient buildings
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is nice. It's cold and foggy in the afternoon (most of the time) so I guess it would be better to go there in the morning.Ps. Friend on photo
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Amazing kingdom, lots of souvenirs,  clean toilets. Great Cafe n coffee shops. Very popular"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A must visit place. Not advisable for those who have knee problems. Very difficult in parking areas if you have cars, parking place is expensive range 100 above"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The site is privately-owned I think and then the developer thought of converting it into a tourist spot but didn't put enough planning so that it avoids over-crowing, parking spaces aren't enough and the traffic is high during weekends..."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I came here with my boyfriend! And nag enjoy kami sa view!!! Luckily we got there earlier before it went busy and packed with lots of visitors/tourists It was indeed worth the travel 👏🏼♥️
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place but go when its a weekday as the place tends to be full of tourists on holidays and weekends. The place is instagram worthy.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The stone structure are a sight to see but it seems a little dangerous due to the fact that it isn't secured by atleast cement or wires, but the viewing experience overall is nice"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A lot of work to get the rocks, stones in the right place, very prestigious project with a great result, enjoyable for the whole family, because of its popularity very crowded"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Still on going development so all thing are new. The view is clean. Some accessories are still to be put up. Over all since this time. The place really is like a kingdom on it's outside appearance. There is no indoor yet.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A decent theme park in Baguio. There is still work going on but this does not stop tourists from flocking to this attraction.The place can be chaotic as tourists were not mindful of the flow. Some people take off their face masks for photos but a number of them go around the park and do not wear their face masks anymore.Good for one-time visit.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice setup but some of the parts are still being constructed.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Its an amazing experience to visit the place Stone Kingdom in Baguio city...😊
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Still under renovation when we visited it.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Amazing . Another place to visit in baguio citu
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"None much of an offer save for a man made structure for picture taking and IG addicts to be honest. Very clever business idea what with 100 per head entrance fee and the multitude of crowd. Overheard an expat exclaimed, ""this is a tourist trap""."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very nice and goodWonderful
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New attraction in Baguio. Beautiful structures and overlooking of the place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Great place to visit for family.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,All goods para sa family and friends . Affordable rates pa
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Nice place, clean, entrance fee of 100per head, ascending en descending areas.."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Despite being touristy on a weekend, I can't help but be in awe with this new Baguio destination."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"New normal visit here, such a nice view 😊"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Good for taking pictures. Family and couples.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Took some great photos here. Try to go mid week when crowds are less.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New place to see if interested. Over rated although lots of tourists visiting the place. Not recommended if you have a problem with your legs.  Not suitable for wheelchairs and pushchairs.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not Yet Finished but the place is a good place to know some igorot infos and stuffs. Might want to get a guide for a fee for the quick infos.. but can be done solo anyways. Make sure to have a good shoes that doesnt slip in case of rainfall..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Parking:If you're early, there's a few slots here. Nearby Sozimura, Long Road Cafe offers pay parking and pay CR as well. Further uphill, Petron also offers parking space. We were there around 8am and it can get really crowdy.Registration:Queue for registration is fast but they still use paper ticket that needs to be stamped right in front of the entrace. P100 for adult, P80 for seniors.Attraction:There are signs inside, you can go around and find a perfect photo spot as you wish. There's also food stalls and Igorot costume rental. I heard it can be foggy in the afternoon but better come on a weekday. There's also a sunset view point so I'm assuming it gets really crowded around that time.CR:Haven't tried, pay CR available in nearby cafesNearby:Restos but parking is hardThe Farmer's Daughter (with parking but opens 9:30am)Tam-awan Village (didn't see the parking, opens 8am)"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A surprising magical place. Awed by the intricate building of stone walls, towers and stairs. Trully mesmerizing. Get yourself a cup of coffee and spend the whole afternoon in cloud 9."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Great place for tourist, very enjoyable like hiking in a kingdom"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I'd rate it 5 stars if they improve the parking space.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"One of the best place to visit.Fastantic and enjoyable to visit in Long Road st.Baguio Best architecture of different stone repraft designs and made by the natives.Igorot Bridge,Mines Cave, and Castle ready for selfies to be enjoyed by family and friends."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Instagram-able place and great for family bonding. Crowded place as it was one of the newest tourist attraction in the city of Pines.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Place is nice and Instagramable .. do good clicks only the prob is parking
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Good for pictures. Just it. No activity.. You can eat snacks and ice cream in their snack area.. Good exercise to walk up and down..entrance fee at 100 pesos.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The experience is surreal ❤️
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"One of a kind experience., u will prove it to yourself  that patience is virtue once u visited the Igorot Stone Kingdom how they constructed the igorot stone kingdom manually."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Best to go on a weekday. Its too crowded now to enjoy.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,if you're willing to ubos your energy.Go here.*historical*informational*entertaining
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Truly a place for the Igorot experience. The up and down climbs through small walk paths mimic the up and down climbs across the mountains. I kid you not. But its an enjoyable experience at certain levels and stops you get introduced to aspects of igorot culture: the white carabao, the prayer cone structures of the igorot gods, the stone throne of the igorot king,  the meeting chamber of the igorot elders where they decide to make war, and the igorot bridge of gold; are just some of the sights. Enjoy keep an open mind. By crossing the bridge of gold the igorot traverses into a western style castle. This is akin to the igorot migrants journey, who upon achieving success, he migrates to the great western lands and traverses their kingdoms and makes them his own. Look and see this underlying story in the great Igorot Stone Kingdom."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Such beautiful structures. Spent an hour or two mesmerized by everything. Very picturesque!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This one's a new place to visit in Baguio. Every corner is great to take some selfie pics!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Awesome... Thanks and keep improving
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"So expensive for the entrance, not reasonable for visit, there are thousands of tourist and yet they have only 2 toilets open, people need to fall in line"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,100 entrance fee
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Still in progress , much better if they consider more safety precautions"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This Stone Kingdom is one of a kind!!!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I loved the experience. One takes a journey through the 'Kingdom'. In the end, you experience immense joy and peace. It's beautiful and spiritual. Although it's still under construction, it's a great place to visit, alone or in group."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A must in your itinerary . old and young ones will enjoy the scenic view of this stone Kingdom. Make sure you wear comfy shoes as you will climb a lot of steps to get to the top.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Super love by the kids. 👍
Igorot Stone Kingdom,There's no parking space. You can park on the next establisment but its too expensive.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New tourist attraction place to add in your bucket list. A must see in Baguio City.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Its not finished yet but they already charge adult 100 pesos per head and discounted price for kids. Not much to do here aside from taking pictures and walk up the castle which is not yet a castle but a building of concrete. The white stones look nice on picture but they still lack baguio greenery there. it gets hot there when the sun is up its probably because of all the stones
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Another majestic new tourist attraction in Baguio City to visit.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Beatiful and good place, it reminds the Anse stories of the past."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,So much fun i love igorot stone kingdom super enjoy that place i love it very much i promise to come back 😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Such a great master piece from our igorot brothers and sisters. It is a must to visit.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I think the entrance fee is overpriced. Compared to Botanical Garden and Mines View where entrance is only PHP10, you can enjoy more beautiful scenes than at this place which entrance fee is PHP100 per person."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Well.... only taking pictures on high altitude. Nothing muchExpensive entrance fee 100 for adults 80 for seniors and kids. 3 and below are free, ridiculous 👎"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Igorots really have the knack in making stone walls
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Under expansion prin,i enjoy the flute music from local igorot musician"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,relaxing view from above. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A display of the well-known stone masonry skills of the igorots. Fascinating but not planned well for tourists to rsally appreciate their works. Sayang naman ang angking talento ng mga igorot. And parking is a b*&%$!!!!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Amazing and nice experience for kids...need to prep your feet and legs for a lot of walking
Igorot Stone Kingdom,One of the newest attractions in Baguio.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"They are still improving their place, but it is already instagram worthy! Visit now!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,100peso entrance feeGood for photos and that's itMaybe the owner is Lego lover ☺️
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is still improving.Even though its still under construction, its already a nice place to walk around and take photos..."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A new place to explore. Continuous development is observed. Maybe a museum of cordillera cultures will be here soon.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,My 1st time to go here and it was amazing hope to visit again with my fam🤗As usual parking space still hard to find out🤣
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The fee to enter and move around doesnt seems to be worth it. Much better to visit the Mines View Park instead.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The architecture of the kingdom was spectacular! I've never seen such thing before. It was absolutely worth the trip for I took so many good photos at Igorot Stone Kingdom.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The amount of people coming in should be maintained. Went there earlier and it was really crowded to a point where you needed to squeeze to get through crowds of people considering that we are still in a pandemic. The signs for which way to go was not visible which caused confusion among many people especially on the path to the right going up. We weren't even able to go to the very top. The price of a ticket (₱100) is way too expensive for you to just walk up some stone structure with no proper signages present. It isn't really worth it.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Instagrammable place, great for those who love to trek and appreciate the stunning view of this man-made marvel. Native-Igorot costumes can be rented at 50PHP only, where you can take a picture anywhere within. Drinks/food stalls available at the side right when you enter, same as when you reach the top of the castle-front."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place seems to be a bit too artificial. The place is also too crowded. The place seems to be still under construction. Both commuting to get there and parking is a challenge.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice place in view
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"looking at the kingdom from the deck view was amazing! its instagrammable! tiktokers, fb lovers, am sure you will like the place 100%!don't forget prenup events, too.  however, i can say it was a nice experience going up the top but, the entrance fee is quite expensive for 100php when all you could really do is to look at the view. and do a lot of photoshoot 😊"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Other parts were not yet finished when we visited. Far from where we stay.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,nice place to unwind and relax
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Be aware of business during the weekends. Go for weekdays for the nicest pictures.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very crowded on weekends.a heritage place must be visited.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Appreciate the effort to have another tourist spot. But there is just no ""soul"" to it."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This is a popular tourist spot. It's really just a site where you have multiple pathways and a single bridleway for tourists to go through like a maze of sorts with the backdrops resembling a castle on one side and the other side being made of stone. There's food served at the top. Parking is limited
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The entrance is too high for what u can see are just pure stones.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice and Historic Place
Igorot Stone Kingdom,New place and new experienced
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It has to be finished to be able to appreciate it.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Beautiful and nice
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Supper worth it! I love the place ❤️❤️❤️
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Love it....Every moment counts ..It's a different kind of experience.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Entrance fee for adults is 100. The place is very nice. Amazinh landscape and view. Cafe is also available.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The entrance fee is expensive compared to other tourist spots
Igorot Stone Kingdom,There was still some construction ongoing while people were visiting.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's ok if you want to get a feel of how a fortess is like. Be ready to walk and climb up stairs.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Good to see how they made this place so beautiful. Thankful to the locals, nice job👍"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not an elderly friendly place as the stairs are too steep. But the view is nice.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Great place to take pictures and to stroll around. Just hope more ethnic activities will be added. My family did enjoy joining the dance.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Kudos to those who constructed it. I hope it continues to be safe and awesome for visitors
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Stone Kingdom of Baguio. Amazing structure!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Perfect for IG post/stories but not applicable for your tamad mag-walk fam/friends.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Solid view and nice place to visit. Just pay 100 pesos for entrance and 60 for seniors. Be ready to climb
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is cleaner this time... but some paths are very slippery still.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Place is great and has a lot ot potential. Must visit.Be wary of senior citizen and kids as this involves a lot of climbing to go into good spot
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is still under improvement but it's one of a must-go place when visiting Baguio.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Something new to see in Baguio
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not recommended to visit..This is only a man made place I don't see any historical value or relavance to the place where it was build.And also don't go late to the place coz it's so hard to get taxi and no jeepney around the area.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,nice new theme park at Baguio
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's okay to walk around but it's semi finish and you feel you walk on a construction side. So for the 100 pesos entrance they should have waited to open.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A very unique experience and a very amazing place. Lots of history within the story of the building of this stone kingdom. Encourage all who visit Baguio to visit this unique place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place Is not yet done, still a great place to visit."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I think this place is so unique in terms of viewing a place since it's the fist time everyone can find this amazing kingdom made by our country men proud to be called the igorot stone kingdom.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It was a weekend and it was raining, but other than that it was okay."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is not complete finish constructing. It's still open for visit
Igorot Stone Kingdom,There's not much to see except the stoneworks are done by igorots and you can help them by visiting this place
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Still under renovation but It looks Good
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A lot of trucks and construction happening around the site. Not worth paying the money until it is complete.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Tourist spot in baguio

Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's a new attraction and still awaiting for the completion for us to see the beauty ❤️❤️❤️!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very very nice place to go in Bagiuo ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I am so happy that they added new places to go in Baguio
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's very2x nice view.....
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Waste of time. Although the place is still ongoing construction and unless you're after the actual experience of seeing the piled up stones and less on nature immersion go somewhere else.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Although this place is still under construction, or is not yet finish, overall it is beautiful."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The whole place is great! It is just amazing how they build the stone kingdom. Another place to see when you visit Baguio City.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very nice place your vacation is not complete if you missed this place

Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's an amazing place me and my wife Angelica really enjoyed it so much it's sight to be hold
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Entrance fee of 100pesos is too expensive.   Not worth it.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Reliving the past... In this magnificent creation of our Igorot brothers...
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is great. You learn a few things about the Igorots while touring the place. You also get to have great views once you reach the top of the kingdom
Igorot Stone Kingdom,1. Overpriced entrance fee2. Overcrowded place (no social distancing)3. Heavy traffic4. Worst Restrooms i have ever been5. Still under constructionAvoid this place!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Just visit the place...👍😊
Igorot Stone Kingdom,An impressive tourist attraction.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,This place is still under construction but is now a sought-after place to take pictures in…it has plenty of people visiting .. the cafe is not done yetBut they do have small “stores” where you can buy food to get by…This stone kingdom shows how the highlanders usually do stone masonry…
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's impressive to see, however an Igorot friend informed me that this is purely a tourist attraction and has very little to do with Igorots"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not ready entering very expensive
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Amazing creation
Igorot Stone Kingdom,I sooo love the place..❤❤❤...but they need to add a cafe or a better snack shack with lots of table and chairs to sit because surely after a stroll in this magneficient park many of the tourists visiting would love a good food to nibble while resting at the same time appreciating the beauty of nature.....
Igorot Stone Kingdom,One of the new places to visit
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The price of entrance is not worth ... it must have something souveneir aside from sightseeing ... or maybe lower the entrance fee ...
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A bit crowded even on weekdays. The attraction showcases a glimpse of igorot culture
Igorot Stone Kingdom,a great view you'll surely love.

Igorot Stone Kingdom,This is a new attraction here in baguio. Well this was a stack stone castle. well i came here in the middle of a pandemic That's why i enjoy the view more.. the place is picturesque.👌🏻
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Sorry but I just wanted to give an honest review — I find this place quite overrated. Medyo mahal yung entrance fee, and I find the attraction as quite boring. Better to walk around na lang and get the most out of you Baguio escapade.If you’re already there, try the CARIOCA near the entrance, omg not too sweet at masarap talaga."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Was closed.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Closed already. A local informed us that this is closed for a month already.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very nice
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The entrance fee is 100 pesos80 for seniorsIt's good that he's still doing it on the go. There is also a cr at the top near the canteen at the top on the right side. Parking is really the only problem sometimes and the traffic. There are also those who sell snacks inside such as jam, strawberries, and snacks that are available below if you can climb to the canteen above."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"・If you come to Baguio, you should visit this place for the time being・It is also easily accessible from SM Baguio, and I think it was about 130 pesos in about 10 minutes by taxi.・It is crowded with tourists, but the wait is not frustrating.・For the time being, the Igorotto costume is a paid rental, but you can wear it and move around the premises, so you can get excited (price I don't remember)・Going up a narrow road, the view from above is really good!・However, there are no special souvenirs at this spot just for taking pictures.・There are no impressive activities,・The aunt is wearing a costume and taking a commemorative photo, but there is no particular meaning. ordinary auntie."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A very nice new attraction in Baguio. The design is amazing. The place we are going is foggy and the cold feels good 😍. There are also food stalls such as arrozcaldo, corn, finger foods. The strawberry taho is delicious.Worth a visit here..It was in July that we visited there. The weather is nice so the sightseeing is super enjoyable."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Not a Recommended Tourist Spot.100 entrance fee is not Worth ... Too High ..Overcrowded during weekends. There is no limit to entry .. how can a lot of people be picture friendly .. it's still not in order .. 100 is too much ..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A must place to visit if you go to Baguio. The place is crowded even weekdays. It's hard when it's raining and there's not much shelter but it's a nice place to explore. You will be exhausted from climbing chin.100 per adult80 for kids
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"We went there on Sunday. There are so many people, there is no more social distancing, the other steps can slip if you are not careful. It's nice to visit on weekdays and there are few people, but for me it's not worth the 100 entrance fee on weekends."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,great archi designs although the stone kingdom is over. Maybe we will come back when the place is finished to see more of the beauty. We couldn't even climb to the other side because our feet hurt and we were tired from 2 days of walking around Baguio..haha
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"If you want to visit Igorot Stone Kingdom, have breakfast, so that there aren't too many people and you can also go solo hehehe. Beautiful up to the heights. Parking is a bit difficult when there are a lot of tourists. But beautiful here, as in! Very good experience. No mixed char!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's okay to have a few people for a Wednesday afternoon. It's hard to take a picture without someone else being a photobomber. Nice to see but not to go back.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Nice place🤗 100 per person entrance fee, beautiful place, it's high to climb, not possible with rheumatism 😁 just google map to get to the location more easily. Parking is expensive, we went to 100 😞 just look for cheaper ones"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Great place. Clean and very relaxing. The entrance fee is P100 pesos for adults. It's worth it since it's long while walking and climbing. The store outside are expensive, it's better to buy upstairs because the store is cheaper."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Worth it. The construction of the buildings is very beautiful and quality. Go for a walk friends!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"As of May 2022, he still has construction going on. Not worth the 100 pesos entrance fee 😅"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is beautiful but the 100per head entrance is too expensive and the upstairs parking space for motorbikes is dangerous, it is prone to simple, although someone is guarding the helmets .."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's not done yet, but the place is very beautiful, the e-fee is worth it, make sure to bring water so you don't get wet while walking."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice view relaxing so nice location superb nice view at the very top😍💕💕💕💕 will be visiting again
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The igorot stone kingdom is super beautiful, you will be really impressed by their work❤️"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Too bad it's raining but it's so beautiful it's worth it!
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"As for me, it's pricey because there aren't many activities, just good for taking pictures, appreciating and you'll almost just walk around."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Unique place and easy to get to, beautiful picture picture..Note with intance pay. except 3 years old below"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,He's not done yet. So some new ones will be added. There is an entrance of 100php
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"For P100 entrance, you can see and take pictures of many rocks! 😂 Kidding aside, the place itself looks great! Although, they are still doing a lot and improving in the area itself. Make the parking lot difficult. Very limited parking space outside."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A very boring place, low-cost construction, no artistic sense at all, not a cultural monument, and even a good perspective for taking pictures. The charges are unreasonable, the 200p admission ticket and the parking fee are also expensive. Disorganized management, only suitable for location shooting, not suitable for internal tours"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's a bit boring for me, the place is small, but these stone walls are special, and it's over after taking a few photos"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"akyatan to, mahangin pagdating sa taas..nice and refreshing .."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"We are so amazed to this place, tho we didn't go up to the very high part of the place and we are still adding a lot of improvements to the place :) Hopefully there will be mini activities for those who took the tour."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,There are a lot of people and it's still raining but the place is okay love the castle ❣️  
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's worth going even if it's storming😂😂
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's ok inside, so maybe 100 entrance fee because it's still under construction. It's also hot inside, more climb if you bet a good insta worthy pic"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is beautiful, there are many rocks, it's good to take pictures"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,You are worthless. If you're into photos and not experienced you might love the place. Very risky parking especially for motorcycles. A lot of falling and falling. Not worth the trip.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Nice 😍😍😍 you can stay overnight hihi.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"There is a plaque at the entrance to this under construction attraction.It's the story of how a guy, following a dream of a white carabao, decided to rebuild the Igorot kingdom, which disappeared many years ago.A bold idea, and construction is underway, with thousands of stones lined up.Maybe better to come back when the construction is finished."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"100per head senior 50php, 80 kids. It's ok for them to develop the place"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The road is slippery especially when wet. Not for those who are malululain kasi matarik tignan. Clean nmn the place but a bit pricey at the entrance of 100 then only less designs and the place has no other special features. They have statues and carvings plus the free use of thier traditional dress and pwede mag pa kuha with Igorot Locals. It's not almost complete yet because you can still see many under construction in this part of the place. On the next visit, I wonder if the fee will be more worthwhile."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The place is beautiful. But those who charge above the riprap area are unappealing. Paintings are only close together but 20/head. Then when we took a picture at the May Igorot standee, someone immediately shouted twenty per head, even more hostile. We took a picture again in the chair, another twenty, there was another twenty in the chair next to him, literally just 3 steps, another twenty can head. The two young women charged angrily. Unbecoming of a tourist spot. I hope the charge is only once upon entering. Every twitch, charge ... Umbra that leaves happy and went for a walk, leaves When he lost his appetite for the place -_-"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,You can also rent Baguio's folk costumes. Some of them were playing Andean folk music.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Good for picture taking. There are also parents of Igorot Outfit that you can wear in the whole place to take pictures. The size of the place and still under development when we went, but the potential is great if it takes time, given that it is 2020 to start working on it. Near Tam-Awan Village so it's good to go along with your walk."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's closed..until further notice.. We went on 11/21/22. They should have information on their page so don't waste your time going there..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Mdanda puru stone ,, under contruction pa pero ok namn"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,sobrang ganda kaso di namen masyado naenjoy kase umulan bawi na lang next layff
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's OK. You can see the art of the area but it seems unfinished. It's not friendly because there are a lot of climbers. 😂
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is beautiful. Strange. Hopefully next time we come back fully developed.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Love it. The beauty and the cleanliness of the place.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"the best, nice work"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A park that impressively recreates the living environment of the local natives in ancient times. It is interesting to walk around the park and be impressed by the lifestyles of the ancients and enjoy the view from the strategic observation points scattered in high places that are suitable for it.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is nice...clean restroom..but their parking is far away...
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It always seems crowded. Then it's crowded .... is the Mirador trail actually better ....
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Filipino tribal buildingsMade of stone

Igorot Stone Kingdom,Amazing! still be vigilant there is still a long handed person who is taking d his umbrella 😃
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"There is nothing to see much just to do landscape photography, a pretty boring place.The entry as of 6.7.22 was 100 pesos"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,There is an entrance fee. Crowded and difficult to get a taxi. It's not fully finished yet but it's a nice view.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Hard to get to. It's beautiful. lady man
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Headgear of weekdays overcrowd weekends
Igorot Stone Kingdom,4 stars first HAHHA the other spots are still under construction now then they lack food and are also a bit pricey .The view is Instagramable and the place is a bit wide so your feet are ready HAHHAH go up mandin100 entrance fee for adults and 80 for children but for toddlers it's free
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It was so amazing..and I was even more impressed with the workers who were climbing the stones one by one..
Igorot Stone Kingdom,it's hard to take a taxi when traveling on your own ... the queue is long because I'm going on the weekend
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The place is nice because it was over crowded to think it was a weekday when we went
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Good, not fully finished, I'll be back again after a year, relieves stress 👍"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Worth 100
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It was amazing. but he was only small.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Too many people, it's a bit difficult to park because it's Sunday"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Igorot stone kingdom is very nice. If your knees hurt, it might be difficult to climb. We just had a hard time parking. We need to park there on the steep road, we just begged the private residential to park with a 50 pesos fee."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Much better to go in the afternoon. The place is beautiful. More walking but it's fine
Igorot Stone Kingdom,That's what's in the picture. It's a bit difficult to park.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Wow, Super amazed at the place. Kudos to the Archs. And Engineers who planned it. 10/10 👏👏👏"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It's also nice here. Next we went back because the cafe was over so we could chill after the tour. 😊
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"If you are going there with transpo be prepared for the traffic and very difficult parking space... I suggest you go around 7am and wait for it to open, because you won't be able to enjoy it at noon because the traffic is already difficult, parking is even more difficult, and prepare 100php per head..."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Very nice work ....
Igorot Stone Kingdom,The road is very foggiess and slippery
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Better avoid going on Sundays because very crowded, a lot of people."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Many have been here! So just for the sake of remembrance!

Igorot Stone Kingdom,"It's so beautiful. I don't see it outside, but when you go inside, it's very different. the pic is on FB but it's worth 100 pesos entrance"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Nice place a bit far away but good experience under construction, parking is free, the cr is clean, no entrance fee is charged"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,Bring water.. promise you will be thirsty..

Igorot Stone Kingdom,New sights.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Great scenery. You just have to prepare yourself for a long queue in getting inside. Prepare your vaccination card and P125 entrance fee for adult. Discounts are given to kids and senior citizens. Wear shoes when planning to go here and umbrella for a surprise rain. Traffic is expected during peak hours/season
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"It was raining when we went here, you’ll really feel like it was like winter. It is advisable to go here around 4pm so you can have a good spot for parking.ENTRANCE FEE10:00 AM - 4:59 PMAdult - 90Kids (4-12 years old) -30Senior Citizen (60 years old and above) -50Presentation of Senior Citizen ID is required5:00PM-10:00PMAdult - 125Kids (4-12 years old) -50Senior Citizen (60 years old and above) -90Presentation of Senior Citizen ID is required"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The price is 250 pesos for adult and 150 pesos for kids. Not the best experience because you will have to stay in long lines as you can see in the picture. The organizers will make a lot profit for this because as I can count from the time that we were there, that number maybe around 500+.Visit this place during weekdays and never on weekends.Limited  parking space.Accommodating staff.Great lightings."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Pros: The place is beautiful, must visit in the evening to see the colorful lights.Cons: The place is too small, a little bit of disappointment because the entrance fee is too pricey for 90 pesos.Note: Bawal ang naka slipper so make sure to wear shoes and bring your vaccination card."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Place might be overrated due to social media, but a must experience. Lines can get long waiting up to 1hr during its peak hours, while you'll be spending less than 15 mins inside (P 125 entrance fee). Slippers are supposedly not allowed inside, but its'nt slippery so no worries. The place is quite small and can easily get cramped so wearing a mask is necessary. However there is something magical about this place that is truly worth the wait."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"It's relatively small. The December 2021 version showcased a short skit of the Nativity. You can take pictures with the cast. There's also a live band that livens the mood, and 'snow' every regular interval (not good for people wearing slippers and those who are careful with their shoes as it's just foam). Great way to bond with friends and snap pictures. But do not expect a grand scale area, again, it's small and limited."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"(Visited last Nov 15, 2022) We had a great experience at the Baguio Country Club Christmas Village 2022 with a theme: Oriental Winter Wonderland. The area is small, you can literally roam around in about 5-10 mins. You'll would probably stay longer for just enjoying the place, taking pictures, listening to the live band and christmas music, watching the Christmas nativity play (happens every hour if not mistaken), or buying food and drinks at the stalls around. It gets quite crowded fast too, thus the 4 stars. Line Queue buildup starts at around 5:30pm, as Evening is the best time for you to visit this place. Finding a parking space is rough and traffic gets really busy at peak hours. It would be best and more convenient if you just get there via Taxi.See photos and captions."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Very crowded inside and the ""snow"" will surely make your shoes muddy. That's why it's good to follow the rules, wear shoes instead of slippers. Nice attractions though, good for picture taking"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"This place was known as Christmas village. Yet, when the Panagbenga started, they develop this area and design it into a Japanese culture. When you visit here, you will be amazed of the beautiful scenery. You will really feels you are not in Baguio. Just come in visit this place. The landscape won't last long. It will end when the Panagbenga ended also."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"We enjoyed a lot and It's worth the fee. But as far as I know, there is crowd control and a limit on the number of people who must be inside the Christmas village, but when we were there, it seemed like there were so many people inside that you couldn't enjoy the attractions or take a nice photo because of the crowd. Maybe this part needs to be improved. But all and all, the place is beautiful. If you have kids, I recommend that you bring them along - they will really enjoy it. Pinaka nag enjoy kami sa mga poging Korean Kawal 😂"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Snow is everywhere ehehe.. The skit, the lights and the sounds are quite okay. The place is relatively small to walk around. I think they also need to improve designs as well. But staffs are friendly."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The area ia very small and good for pictorials only with the vibrant color of fake flowers and trees. Most of the people there enjoying the fake snow flakes every 15 mins.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"It's traffic  during weekends  to get to Christmas  village. We were Stuck in traffic for 2 1/2 hours, and upon reaching Christmas village(baguio country club) theres a long queue(until the side of the road). Wearing slippers  not allowed too, and need to present  vaccination card."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Great place for everybody! A must-visit destination if you're having a trip to Baguio this Holiday season!4 stars only because parking area is just along the road and a bit far from the Christmas Village.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Beautiful underated, not much to do but take pics no food or other amenities"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Perfect spot, I expected wider space to saunter and more to see, but all in all, it is a good place to spend time with loved once ☺️ Merry Christmas indeed !"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"place is great for kids and adult. If you're planning to visit christmas village, I suggest enter the place at 4:30pm because they will open the lights at 5:45 if you go there at around 5pm it will be hard to find parking and you'll wait too long in the entrance."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Me and my friend went there around 7 in the evening, heavy traffic because it's weekend but still it's fun, charge to experience 🤪. Slippers not allowed."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"worst theme park ever. probably the worst ""wannabe' theme park i've ever been.charges 125 pesos for nothing but the poorest quality of cosplays, and other tourist attraction remakes.the roads are very narrow also with no proper loading and unloading areas and the security guards are uncoordinated and disrespectful. (so people are expected to just walk???)"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The lights are pretty but there's nothing special about it. The area is just small and the ""snow"" is soap that makes the ground slippery. The crowd that enters is not controlled and you ran the risk of getting stranded if you are to rely on public transportation."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Reasons why this place is not worthy:The line is super long as it took as almost 2 hrs to reach the ticket booth;Entrance fee should not be over 100 pesos;It is not a snow, rather a bubbles from soap;Lack of attraction instead they have food stall left and right;Hard to get a cab back to the city center."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Place is great. Better to visit this place via taxi because it doesn't have a parking space.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The kids will surely have fun here
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It's a lot of fun there but I don't expect it to be that small.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,What a wonderful night in the Christmas Village experiencing a Winter Wonderland theme.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Nice place for the family, they sell nice food too"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Kids will definitely enjoy the experience of having a pretend white christmas. There are lots of characters to take a picture from. Just hoping the place was a lot bigger. It gets crowded immediately.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Great at night for family outing or for couple to experience a glimpes of white christmas🎄🎄🎄
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Traffic costs , 150 pesos. There are other places places to be. I was a pwd showed proper documentation and they still gave me a hard time. They kept calling management because they didnt know how to deal with me when i asked for a chair to sit down to wait . No wonder people are selling their membership shares. Hopefully management reads this and will do better when i visit december."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,There is a problem with parking but the overall experience was amazing.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Charming Christmas Village with bubble snow to add to that Christmas feel. There's a show that runs in 30 minute intervals. Try the fruit juice and sandwiches in one of the stalls in the village as it is the perfect combo while watching the show and experiencing the place's ambience.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,My kid had an awesome time here! Place is not huge but it it well lit nice outfits by different characters people always smile. There are food available inside mind that rubber slippers are not allowed! Entrance fee is 120 per head. It's a nice place overall.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The entrance fee is not worth it for the placeSmall place. Nothing special, flowers mostly artificial."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Long line just to get inside only to be greeted by lame painted boxes with lights, plastic plants, soap and lame ""attractions"". Don't waste your time, go to botannical instead."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The place looks dreamy and children will definitely love it. Though many of the flowers are not real, they still make the place look great. There's even a Wishing Wall for children on one side and near the entrance, you'd see several stalls where you can buy food to eat. The entrance fee is worth it if you're looking forward to an instagrammable place. Also, they have prepared performances to make things better aside from the snow and dancing light show. And of course, the highlight, the Nativity Scene portrayal."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Good attraction. Small dogs are allowed. Snow made of bubbles. Asian-themed stations for picture taking.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Overpriced , expectation vs reality fails misetably. No parking for walk ins, just for some bubbles (the snow) in a very small park. When overcrowded, photos is not Instagramable."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Totally not worth the price. And the hype. Lol. We went there expecting too much because of the hype it got online but there's really not much to see. The kids were enven excited with the fake snow but even that was a little disappointing, since it was soap, the fake snow was made of bubbles from soap. It would've been okay but after the snow stopped falling, his white shoes turned brownish...why? We'll never know...Also, please note that they do not allow people wearing flip-flops in because of, you know, the soap thing...It would've been okay but for 120 pesos? I don't think it's worth it, what we saw was only worth like 35 to 50 pesos. The place was not grand, upon entering, you'll already see everything, I've seen better Christmas villages that do not even ask for money.Even my 5-year-old niece, who's so fond of Christmas lights, did not even enjoy the place.Not recommended. Not going back there anytime soon."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"This year's Paskuhan Village is not as great as previous ones. But hey, its for charity so no money is wasted if you visit."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,a night at the village with matching bubbles that looks like a snow falling from the sky
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,This place is very kid friendly. Your family will enjoy the artificial snow and the cold weather in baguio.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Great place to visit with kids.They have a show, choir and you can take photos at the nativity part of the place."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Not worth it at 125 pesos. Much much better to go to Botanical Garden Christmas displays for P10 only.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Artificial snow is made of suds or bubbles so it can be messy. Flipflops, sandals and open shoes are not allowed inside. Price is affordable at P120 so it can really get crowded. Best time is around 5-530pm and avoid heavy traffic; show starts at 6pm."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The place may be small, but worth visiting especially if you are travelling with kids. The snow bubbles show that runs every 30 mins adds excitement. My friends and I stayed here for 1 hour only though."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Need vaccine card & no flip flop slippers allowed, avoid this place"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The place is very pleasing to the eyes.. although it was filled with artificial flowers. Php120 entrance fee is worth it. Just remember to wear shoes, instead you will not be accommodated. I really loved their bubbles, it gives you the experience of snow, which will bring out the inner child in you."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"This is such an awesome place. You will really feel happy here. This is amazing Christmas Village, very picture perfect! I highly recommend visiting this place, not only good for kids but for adults as well. #WheretogoInBaguio #WhenInBaguio #BaguioCityTour"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The entrance fee is only 120 and the price is really worth it. We went here last Nov. 9 and we're so lucky because that was also the opening and ribbon cutting. There was also an amazing fireworks display its really amazing. I so Love this place 😍😍
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,One of the best tourist destination during holiday seasons in Baguio City.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Kinda small area. I thought its a big park.Take note don't wear slipper they will not let you to enter the gate 😕😑
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Santa's garden also known as Christmas Village is really good. The entrance fee of 120 pesos is really worth. There are a lot of picture worthy spots and there's artificial snow too!!
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Great place for families. There are booths with good and cheap food. There's a show, live Belen, 'snow', etc. You have to register online since they only take 100 visitors per time slot."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Go early or before 6pm as the line gets crowded. Better commute because parking is a problem.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"So full of people, a very long line in goingbinside, traffic and few parking. Thats why we decided to quit going in."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Nice and expirience the cold weather and having fun with family's and friends
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The most sought place to visit in Baguio at this time. Very long queues for vehicles as well as peoples.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"I have not been to Baguio since 2017. The cabins at BCC are quite nice, newly refurbished and complete with nice amenities,  even french toiletries. Renting for 8 people includes their sumptuous buffet breakfast."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Kids will definitely love this place, snow makers, amazing Lights and designs, it looks magical for kids and for some adults like me😆 😍🤟"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"BCC's annual Christmas Village dubbed as Santa's Garden is delightful. The led light covered supertrees, interactive stations, and ""snow"" making machine make it a great addition to your evening activities. Flower arrangements and landscapes make it equally enticing to visit during daylight. My group visited at 8 pm on the 1st of November and it felt as if the entire Baguio crowd was there! So, if you're planning to visit you might want to be strategic about it."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Its nicer when you personally visit the place. Staffs are accomodating and keep their guests secured and safe
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Entrace fee is 100 last time i went here.Now its 120Full of lights and man made snow soap.Lively here at night.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Long Queueing, Place Is So So, Dont Recommend At All, I Rather Go To Botanical Garden"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Cute place for children but there's nothing much to see.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Snow feel vibes ❄️❄️❄️
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Teller was so rude to us! I'm just telling him the correct number of vaccination card I have, but he said ""wag na wag magrereklamo blah blah blah"". First, I'm just correcting him with his mistake... He ruined our final night tour in Baguio City. Next time, be kind and calm lalo na kung maayos naman din kinakausap."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Expect long lines before getting in. Otherwise good place to visit for the kids and kids at heart.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The Baguio Country Club Christmas Village is an annual event of the Baguio Country Club with the aim to attract more tourists and locals alike during the Christmas Season. Every year, there is a different theme, making it more fun and adventurous to explore. This draws thousands of tourists every year."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It’s a musical bubble bathRates are:120 - Adults50 - kids below 12yoFree Entrance for:Kids below 2yoPWDSenior CitizensThe traffic going to this place is horrible - but it may be different if it was not a Christmas Week.The queue here is really long but the movement is quite fast. Waiting time in line is approx. 15-20 mins.Nothing much to do once you get inside but to take pictures with a fantasy themed venue. But don’t set your expectations too high. 80% of the design is made of plastic props. There is a big center stage where bands or in-house dancers perform 3~5 songs.Then the “snow” comes in every 30 mins. The fake snow is just a giant bubble bath sprayed from the top of the fake lighted trees.Prepare to get your shoes (and your head) soaked in soaped water.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"It was fun to walk around in the Sakura setting. It is a good alternative to the other parks as my senior mom and aunt enjoyed the serenity of the place, just by sitting on the benches and looking at the Sakura themed decorations. The BCC breads for sale was a pleasant surprise 😍"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Very crowded small area with a very long queue to buy tickets.  They use soap bubbles  for the fake snow so it is slippery.  Traffic is very bad around the area.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The christmas lights and snow fall are mesmerizing. It's like a different country within the city.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Need a vaccination card. They should indicate in their post or publicity that guest should bring vaccination cards.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The spirit of Christmas in Country Club's Christmas Village
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Had so much fun and they are all accomodating and friendly! Super recommended! A must visit place while in Baguio.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,We managed to find a makeshift parking spot a few meters from the entrance of the village. Security personnel dutifully reminded safety protocols.We queued to get tickets (you'll need vaccination cards and clearance from the triage) and enjoyed the place to ourselves since there were very few customers that afternoon.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Its good for kids and kids at heart. If they can improve the ticketing line that would be great. If you will be coming here, make sure to book your tickets online for faster way of getting inside. If not, be ready for at least 45mins waiting in line. Make sure your fully vaccinated and you have a copy of your vax card. Slippers not allowed so make sure to wear close shoes. Once inside enjoy taking picture for all your social media accounts 😉😋😉😋😉😋😉"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Over hype..no parking , no waiting, no loading and unloading.. no social distancing. Basically a way to scam you of your money."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,the place has different themes per year 😊 You may not enter if you are wearing slippers because you might slip when they release the faux snow made of soap 😊
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Though the line was too long, it was moving a bit faster than i thought. It was so fun especially for the kids."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Food was okay. Make sure the buffet you eat is freshly cooked, especially the meats. Staff was courteous, but it could have been better if they smiled more. GM should be replaced. Id give my stay a 3 star. For this one."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Although, I was expecting more of interesting sites inside, the concept of the Christmas Village was great! I loved the play that serves as the introductory performance which led to the grand lighting of the Christmas Village with matching festive songs. I totally felt the festive vibe! 6:00pm was totally the right time to enjoy the party!"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Nice place for a family or group of friends. Been there last month.. enjoyed the snow bubbles😁
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Top class inspiring Christmas decorations. Adds to the real ambiance of Christmas
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It's not worthy of 120php entrance fee and not so instagrammable too. Expect a crowd since it's seasonal.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Simple and just a small area to roam around. Live band when we visited the place on Sunday. Entrance fee of 120php. 3* for the effort😊. The Snow were bubbles from laundry powder soup.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"We went here for the raisin bread, and still had to pay the entrance fee. And when we got in, apparently there’s no raisin bread anymore. The guys at the booth could’ve told us already because we already asked them about the raisin bread but still had us pay and go in for NOTHING. Aside from that, no drop off area, no parking, and really snooty guards    your time and effort is honestly better spent somewhere else."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It’s a small place but is very Christmas-y! I love the lights and the artificial snow.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,A good place but crowded. They should limit the entry of customers to ensure customer satisfaction.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Hoping to have a bigger space in the future. They should do something with the traffic
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Its nice .. its long pila when u entee but once ur inside its nice
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Perfect for out of town christmas wander 💕
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Not so grand and entertaining this year but still a good place to go to see lights and Santa.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Didn't enjoy much. Very small property. They used soapy bubbles as fake snows. Mess all over the floor. Php 100 entrance fee even for the kids. Parking is a mission!For what it's worth, performers did ok and Food vendors had variety of choices.Save your Php 100 if you're a big family."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It's to pricey. The space is too small and not much events.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Colorful lights and a cool place.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The snowing experience is very nice. However because the place is so crowded it's hard to get a very nice photo of every attraction that they have inside.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"I really loved our visit here. The queue was a breeze. Though small, there is a lot that you can see and the live band topped it off."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Better than the previous years. However, as crowded as ever."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Early Christmas feels.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Your kids will enjoy here, maybe for adults also."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,#paskosapinasLove this! Welcome to Baguio City! White christmas in the philippines..
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Great place!
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Too expensive and then the place looks so ordinary, nothing special at all."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,best hotel ever although very strict in dress code
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Experience a white christmas with a snow experience inly here at Baguio Country Club Christmas Village.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"When I visited Baguio, this is one of the place everyone should visit, they have Bubble snow and some fascinating decorations, very Instagram friendly place."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Nothing really special. Okay lang ang place. Good for picture-taking purposes lang.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Very instagrammable and the ambience, very festive"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"didn't even get the chance to dine in. We were supposed to have buffet breakfast while we were checked in The Manor. It's rrally good that they safety protocols during the pandemic. Though we have all the documents and requirements at hand, we were still not allowed to go in"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Overcrowded. Very Limited street parking.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Looking for something new try to visit this amazing beautiful Korean and Japanese inspired garden located at Christmas Village Baguio Country Club. Artistic,creative artworks of gardening."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Place was fantastic.. The ""snow"" is loved by kids. Live band was good. Good place to bring kids.."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Best place to feel Christmas
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The early iterations of the Christmas Village were more pleasant though not necessarily better. Nowadays, going to & from the area is a huuuge trouble.  Very big inconvenience for the residents of surrounding areas as well as it has been causing traffic that affects not just the adjacent ones but the surrounding barangays as well.  Good luck with parking too as there is no dedicated spot for those visiting (Country Club parking is exclusive for members & their guests).  You might think to gamble & leave your vehicle street side but the city's now strict with parking & traffic related laws so you might get a violation for your troubles too.Very long queues both at the entrance and at the attractions.  The entrance fee is pricey compared to what you'll enjoy inside.  The place ain't that big to begin with so you'll end up hating the experience because of the unpleasant volume of foot traffic.  They should control the number of people inside.  Try to not to go there on weekends and holidays as there are fewer people.  Crowd's still uncomfortably large though.  Try to go there early December for a more pleasant experience."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Everyone will enjoy the spirit of Christmas here, specially kids!"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"I would have rated it higher. Maybe this will help in improving the famous Christmas village. I hope they improve their snow machine and not use soap suds, it is a bit disappointing and mediocre. It is also a bit crowded since the space is small and cramped. But overall, it is a nice place to visit during the holiday season."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Oh wow soooooo beautiful 😍 place ...
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,A Wow! Experience..!! Kids are so happy and so are we!
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Cold stroll around a small area with bubbles replicating snow. Okay time but too pricey for the experience.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Sheesh 👌
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Great Spirit of christmas, sooo beautiful❤❤❤"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,enjoy and very good sportmanship with the staff like!!
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Well, we went on a sunday weekend before christmas so it was packed! Basically, you pay to enter the village and take photos. 😇 There was a made-up snow being bubbled every 15 minutes (or 30, i forgot). It was nice for a family friendly event."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,2017 Christmas Village is better than 2015 and 2016. I hope 2018 is better.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"So far, despite pandemic, you'd still enjoy the xmas-y ambience the place brings. You need to do online reservation to visit the place. Downside, you have to inform through your Facebook page that the HDF should be completed within 24-hr window upon your visit. Since visitors are unaware, queue gets disorganised. I wouldn't be surprised if social distancing might've been violated due to this"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Not really a place for me. Good destination spot for those who have kids. If you wanna see foamy soap snow the be my guest and wait in line for more than an hour. My favorite spot here was the exit sign. Tip - read the warning signs they wont let you in wearing slippers. Also parking is terrible here. Prepare to walk a looooooot.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The place is small and not much fairy lights. Their highlight was the fake snow, that's about it.The place was full of people during weekends, we can barely move. It was uncomfortable and many others were noticeably disappointed.Their 2019 theme was the Avengers and Game of Thrones. I can understand Game of Thrones, but Avengers as a Christmas theme?"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Overpriced and a bit cheesy, but a good place for families with little children. You have to pay by GCash or else pay by cash via the booth at the parking lot. It's a QR code mess"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,This is just for kids. It's small and you can see the whole place in one glance. The entrance fee is a bit expensive for just that. Slippers are not allowed but there are stores outside that lets you rent a pair of shoe for only Php50.00. Their pair of shoe is old and I am not sure if its smelly (didn't try to smell it of course).
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Too crowded. Over-rated
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"congested with people, you'll not enjoy the whole area because it's way too packed with peeps so expect a lot of photo bombers on your photo. I think it's over priced, there's really nothing much to see aside from different christmas lights and christmas decors that you can see as well in Burnham Park - for free lol. Oh the place has fake snow which by the way is just soap suds so be careful if you're kinda sensitive to any unknown chemical ingredients."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,People are nice. They follow rules. But these rules can be improved bu the management to make more sense.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Well it warms your heart in a cold cold night 👍👍
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Wow! Super cheesey and 100 % hype. The place is tiny. Maybe has roughly 7 vendors. The restrooms are actually portable toilets located just outside the exit. The snow is nothing more than soap bubbles.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The foods is good,And all the staff good to serve and assist you."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It was a very very unique and fun experience. We will definitely go back to that place.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The place to buy the famous Baguio Country Club raisin, banana and cheese breads."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,I suggest buying tickets in the early afternoon and come back in the evening to avoid the long lines. Great for kids.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Dont wear slippers. At this place.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Entrance fee is too much for the scenery inside. I'm expecting that there is unusual scene or view however I was disappointed as there is none. Flowers used are all fake. Nothing impressive.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Not worth it for the 120 pesos we paid for. Kids may enjoy but adults will not. I dont know what the concept is. Avengers with game of Thrones plus santa and elves.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Adventure.. and very nice place
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It was very bad experience!First of all the place is not that much big and second the facilities for costumers are not good enough. They're selling the tickets continuously but the place itself cannot accommodate the people anymore.For the managements shout out. Business is business huh! 😏
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"staff are rude and its very unorganized, you ask questions to the staff  but they couldn't answer there bery unsure of what there doing, but the experience inside is good with the fake snow🤮"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"A situational event that happens in Baguio Country club. I enjoy going to this place yearly, especially since my kid enjoys the festivity. Place gets hectic at times. The bubble (snow) looks cute and the kids enjoys it so much (as do I). Mind that the ground gets sticky and muddy as they go. The event doesn't have that much bang into it as the performers perform within schedule, so there are times when nothing happens. Still an amazing place to bring your kids every Christmas season."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,NOT WORTH THE PRICE..dont be deceived by photos online.the place is very small very few attractions and to top it all of they have a rule that all slippers “regardless of the brand” are not allowed inside. One of my colleagues was wearing a open toe sandal not slippers but she wasnt allowed inside so we have to walk a mile to find the nearest shop inside camp john hat selling native doll shoes..to our disapointment when we were inside we saw a lot of other visitors wearing slippers..
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"It's simply no worth all the hassle you'll have to go through and cause others to get there, not to mention the entrance fee. Opens in the late afternoon which at times would take you 2 hours to there no matter where you're coming from in Baguio. Not enough parking space. And what's there? Tacky props and sets, stalls selling cup noodles and fishballs, bored, amateur performers (one of the ""three kings"" picking his nose in full view of everyone). Unless you think getting soaked in soap suds when they turn on the fake snow machine is worth the traffic and P120-entrance fee, then by all means go. Otherwise, it's just not worth the traffic hell this place causes not just in its immediate vicinity but to several communities around it."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"good to visit, especially since there aren't a lot of tourists around. the cash payment booth just needs to be relocated somewhere near the entrance so it will be more convenient for customers to pay."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Sorry but the Christmas village this year is not as beautiful as the previous year. Sad to say the essence of Christmas is gone on my own perspective.. The birth of Jesus seems to be secondary in their set up.. To be honest, im dissappointed with this years Christmas Village. I hope they will focus on the birth of Jesus than dragons, avengers and all.."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"I am sorry, not worth the 120php. Needs improvement."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Super long queue. Will take about 1-2hrs waiting in line so you have to be there ahead of their opening time.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Design was nice but theme was confusing. Could've just focused on one and make it family friendly. Last year was better for me. Parking was also difficult
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Nowadays it's called the BCC Food Camp. So up we went with my foodie family and we expected some sort of a food park that offers unique selections of cuisines. Well... We had to laugh at the disappointment of finding out it was the same Christmas Village minus the belen, the center stage converted into a biking area. The food stalls were the same as those that served during the holidays. Nothing spectacular really."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"My first time to visit BCC christmas village, tho its not real snow.  but surely you will gonna enjoy here, feels like you're young again. We went to the place as early as 4pm and good the queu is not that  long yet, come early so you will enjoy selfies otherwise if you arrive late lots of people  are already  there and you will have a lot of photo bomber hahahaha. and be sure bring your towel bcoz once the snow start it seems you shampoo your hair without rinsing lol. During  holiday season its sooooo traffic so be patient. there show is ok, but better add more please....add more snowmen . Very nice specially at night but you gonna enjoy the snow hehehe, during the day. old  not so old, young once, and specially kids will really enjoy the BCC christmas village.Dont wear slippers its so slippery ...slippery when wet...lol."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,This is now a food camp which has an awesome environment. A sure place to hangout with friends.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Nothing special for adults. But kids will probably have a good time. Went in and stayed for 5mins. They don't even have a proper comfort room.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Not as great as it used to be but the golf course is still challenging but not too tough for beginners. Food is excellent but the rooms need major update.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Beautiful decors and light show
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Baguio has a best flowers there is... why in Christmas Village uses plastic flowers... a bit small place @120/head entrance fee... Improve it more.. 1 Star from me...
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Very reasonable entrance prices and surely kids will enjoy
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Too crowded. Not much to see.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Structure are great and stuffsBut those fake snow is not good e.e bubbles.Too muddy, wet and slippery."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Great fun and joy! A great place to take many pictures. A beautiful christmas display filled with exciting colors! Was with a great crowd. The atmosphere was electricfying!
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,We got here on their last day and my kids enjoyed it.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Good place for kids at heart.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Long queue waste of time.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It was a fabulous expee. I just wish that the flowers were real plants. Never mind if they are not tulips. Home grown  flowers are beautiful to the eyes anyway.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"It's a nice spectacle to watch out for every year especially if you're a tourist who wants to experience Christmas in Baguio.The Baguio Country Club Santa's Garden is open starting October 27, 2018 to January 6, 2019OPERATING HOURSWEEKDAYS- 2:00 PM to 10:00 PMWEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS- 2:00 PM to 11:00 PMACTIVITIESNativity Pageant (6:30 PM)SnowfallDancing Light ShowPicture Taking with SantaWishing WallLive PerformersRATESPhp 120.00- Adults (13 y/o and above)Php 50.00- Children (4-12 y/o)Php 85.00- Senior Citizen***Children 3 y/o and below - FREE OF CHARGEBaguio Country Club members***- FREE OF CHARGEPWD*** - FREE OF CHARGE***upon presentation of required cardsREMINDERS-Rubber slippers, regardless of brand and cost, are not allowed-Foods, drinks, and pets are not allowed-BCC reserves the right to close the Christmas Village during inclement weather"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"In a country without snow, BCC will let feel like you are definitely in a snow..their artificial snow plus Baguio' cool weather will perfectly you bring you to a winter wonderland..plus their lights and show are a must see.."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,One of the best hotels in Baguio.Air is still fresh and the smell of pine trees recharges me.Lobby is nice too.Breakfast buffet is ok. Just enough choices. Servers lacked though for the large number of guests. Took me 5 follow-ups for coffee and tea.Family Cottage is homey and has a country vibe.Hamada is a must try Japanese resto. Tepan style...Pastry is also yummy at the bakeshop.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Artificial snow is the best we can get. People enjoy it here. Only those who have had experienced real snow will notice the difference.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Aside from the fact that Baguio was very crowded during Ber-months and at it's peak during december I just didn't expect the number of people going to the christmas village  so better not if your not used to large number of people.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The place is small but cozy Not much attraction aside from nativity show & artificial snow to speak of Overall it's good for 4 stars
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"No real flowers, all plastic, small area, is a place for children"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,BCC christmass village 2018
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Quite a nice attraction in Baguio during the Christmas season. It is located along the Baguio Country Club. Please don't wear slippers tho when going tonthe village as they seem to have a dress code.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Very nice place, Argubaly the most beautiful hotel in Philippines"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The atmosphere is friendly and we had a great time ... If you want to visit it number 1 rule is don't wear flip flops :)
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The main feature of the BCC Christmas Village is the ""snow"" machines which produce snow-like rain in the village using soap bubbles and blower machines. Be prepared to get wet with soap suds!"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Nice place to bring your kids. Christmas feel :)
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,No comfort room. Ready available for the tourist.. you would have to wait for a long que..Comfort room is not match to its visitors..
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Super ganda..,nice..uninspectable experience.."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"not much to see here, just fake flowers."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Too early to close on Christmas Season. Ironically, it was called Christmas Village 🙄🙄🙄"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Beautiful place:-)
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Perfect location of the Christmas Village
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Nice..
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The Christmas Village is rather small... The artificial snow is made of detergent bubbles... Makes you feel sticky on long exposure and your phone screen  sticky and dirty
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The concept delights the young and young at heart. The snow every 15 minutes gives a white christmas feeling to the glee of all
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,quite small but great attractions can be seen inside specially the peacock made of flowers
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Not the typical Christmas village.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Slippers and Sandals are not allowed. This place is chaotic and disorganized. Not enough info available, tourists will have difficulty figuring out what the hell is going on."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,We really had fun during our last visit especially i brought some friends from Kuala Lumpur and they had so much fun.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Expect heavy traffic in the area and long lines.. Entrance fee as of December 2017 is Php120 for adults.. No slippers allowed inside..
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"We did not get what we paid for to be able to enter the area. Instead of flurries, they showered bubbles during the snow shower. So disappointing.."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The place was good but it's too crowded. Still a nice experience! :)
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Kids would really appreciate and enjoy it. I had fun viewing their joy and excitement.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"For three days, I am eating lettuce fresh from the Baguio. The veggie was certified fresh because it wasn't transported from downhill cities/municipalities. ^_^"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Very delicious breakfast, very friendly staff & very beautiful golf course.. Our family enjoyed our time there🤗"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,I love their hot chocolate. You can really taste the peanut and feel its texture
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Crowded as usual we went there and yes and the queue it was too long and due to the numerous numbers of people we had to wait for atleast an hour for our vehicle to get to us so basically we went there went in line for a long while we got bored and waited to be picked up by our car end of story
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The restrictions won't make you enjoy the Christmas plus the guards were so annoying. Ang susungit!
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Nice 👍
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,So crowded. No parking space nearby
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Enjoyed our vacation here last year. Gonna visit it again this coming November. Cant wait!
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,A good place to visit...
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Christmas Village is too small, should widen the area specially with an entrance fee of 120 PhP, literally you'd expect more."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Overrated. It's not snow. It's foamy. The only good thing are the Christmas tress but the pokemon character. They look scary.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"They didn't say their close.. Their information says they are open till 11 in the evening but they didn't say they were already close since January 05, 2020.. Please update your info.."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Overated
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Dont wear white shoes. Soap suds aka ""snow"" will get dirt on your shoes. Don't wear slippers either."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,A happy place to bonding with the family
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Nothing new, if you've seen it before, it's not worth it to go again. And as usual,  not enough parking space. Had to park a looong way away from the actual location."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Nice place and beautiful place to take memorable photos
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,My wife and kids enjoy the place
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The place is not that big the movie characters are nice there are food stalls inside
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Terrible!... All flowers displayed there are synthetic! And they made us pay to see it... Horrible experience... don't go there... 😒🙄👿
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Good place for kids.  Wish there were more real flowers though
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The place to go to specially the batirol and raisin bread
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Was OK but nothing special really. Better of paying 150p and going to the light show at camp John Hay.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,TFX 150 mono shock how much and availability of item
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Been there amazed and happy😍 highly recommended for friends and love ones to visit👍
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,This place is overrated! Nothing really special to show except the snow fall which comes like every hour for 5 mins.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,A 150 entrance fee then you see nothing just lights and snow which is just bubbles from soap
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It is better to go there when after Christmas so you can own the place. 😁🤗
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,They won't allow to enter those wearing slippers. And entrance fee is ridiculously high.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Small area, soap bubble snow almost seemed real.  Characters were nice."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Visuals are good and performances are entertaining...good for family recreation during the holiday season...
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Overrated not even worth the 100p entrance, since we did find anything special we only stayed there for 10 mins."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,A great place to go and the artificial snow is equally fun to experience...
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The kids really love this place. The fake snow never cease to amaze them.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Fun place for kids. But no parking space for customers?!
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,This place is for kids and kids at heart as well...
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Totally NOT worth the 120 pesos. There is way better to do and for free 🙂
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Noth worth the long wait and theres so many people that gets so exxagerately crowded
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Still 1 of the best place to stay in Baguio!!!
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Beautiful place.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Love it
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,A bit disappointing since the theme is not fully Christmas. There were characters there that's not even related to christmas.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Very crowded. Not worth it.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Nice place to visit with family
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Make sure not to wear white shoes when you go there this year haha.

Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,You can really feel the christmas presence in that place
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Somewhat disappointing as there is no parking area nearby that you have to park far from the place...

Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Cozy and refreshing
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Need more parking space not on the road side.

Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,an experience
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"a good place to stay, thumbs up!"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It's nice to see something cozy yet familiar. The weather and ambiance of the place is sure to bring back memories of happy times during the Holidays.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Wow
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Expect to be crowded during weekend. Specially at night. Small area but a lot of of places to take picture.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Happenings
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Absolutely no crowd control. They just want to stuff as many people as possible at a time to make their profit. The line to even get in is ridiculously long. And dont fall for the overpriced taho that is sold to you while waiting in line. Sure , the actual sights are nice at night but it is extremely limited. The pictures you see do it more justice than it deserves. If you still feel the need to check it out to take your self validating instagram pictures, go on a weekday.."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Oks lang. For the experience. The supposedly ""snow"" are soap bubbles. great for kids. But not for adults, unless un ang trip mo. What's great is the lights pag gabi na. As well as the live music. Not as spacious as perceived on photos. Siksikan, pahirapahan kumuha ng picture na walang photo bomber. But for the experience, oks na rin. Honest review, I would say botanical's 10pesos fee is sooo much more sulit than 180 in here. By the way, mas okay siguro kung by batch like limited na tao per hour ganyan para maenjoy namin ung binayad namin.May bilihan ng snack pag nagutom. Haven't tried. but good to have habang nagaantay masindihan ang lights. May mga benches din at waiting area especially for seniors and those with babies. Seniors are prioritized here by the way but i doubt they came here because they wanted to. 😄By the way we came here around 5pm cguro or a little past that. Wala palang parking so we left the cars sa sm, took a cab to and fro.PLS DON'T REPOST OUR PICTURES. FOR REVIEW ONLY."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Clearly a place managed by idiots.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,There were so many people lined up when we came.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Php90.00 fee during daytime visit is not worth it.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Line too long
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The place is hard to get to due to traffic. Once you get in, the place is congested. But the attraction is worthwhile. The whole experience is good."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Cool.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Quite slippery in some areas,  because they use soap as snow"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,I enjoyed the ambiance and how they signify the essence of Christmas Season.We are so thankful that we visit this area.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"It's super fun that he warms my heart even though I'm a soloist here!! 💕  🏻✨READY YOUR VACCINE CARDS ALREADY ‼️❣️Scanned copy/picture or bring it yourself, prepare it and if you are a group, compile one. That's because in the queue, the others got in earlier because the others in the line were still looking for a vaccard. ✔️🏁There are performing bands, it depends on their schedule. The cosplayers are really cute, mr and ms claus, the Nativity, king and queen of Korean and some anime cosplayers.The snow effects were puffed from game to time I don't know how often but when I was there for an hour, it was a lot. 🌨️❄️          I really loved the energies, moods and laughter of the kids🏃‍♀️ and some adults (cos some were irritated with the bubbles , so I and they suggest wearing closed shoes and no wearing of pastic footwear as it's slippery).         Yeah, that's it I guess. I really enjoyed it even though I was alone because I was already charged with others' excitement and joy. ✨✨"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Area: it's just small. It only takes 2 minutes to go around, if there are many people it will take 5 minutes.Interior Design: Christmas Village but with anime costumes.Price: I don't know if the price is worth it. 200+ at night and 100+ in the morning. (forget exact price)"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The crowd is overcrowded, the space is small and not very spectacular..only got it at the foam party...you enter and exit immediately after a few minutes..."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Nice experience. Come here now. Until January 2023
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Tickets are priced at 125php per adult, need to present the vaccination card at the reception when buying tickets. The place is okay, not too big but very colorful and lively due to the displays, lights and band. The snow effect is cute and it's very highlighted at night of course, then from time to time and the story telling about Christmas, it's perfect for kids and kids at heart. There are also food stalls inside so don't be afraid to go hungry."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It's worth it. The kids enjoy. 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,There are people here every night. Suko Hehe. The road is crowded. Hehe. The experience here is ok. The twists and turns on the road are just annoying and the security is a bit strict because of covid 19. But overall satisfied. He is ok.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"I hope you will all be among those who entered! Dzai, the line at Burnham was getting too long (charot!) -- but the line was legit too long, we couldn't take it anymore, we just left and went to the Manor. 😭"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,place is so nice. case they are not allowed air slippers inside or even sandals. so you should be wearing shoes because of their snow effect.120 paid to adults and only 50 to kidslights are open after play (6pm)
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"That's right, he's small, you can take a picture anyway but when we went there were too many people. There is snow made of soap hehe. 100 pesos entrance, 50 pesos for 8 to 12 yrs old, and free down."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Limited parking space...you need to take a taxi so you don't have to hustle to park...
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Best for children... Especially at night... ❤️❤️ This year, the theme is classic but its equally nice like before..."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"A place where you can enjoy the snowy scenery of the Philippines. It is small, but there are many spots."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It's just small.. It's not worth the 90 pesos.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Nice place to visit. Especially now Ber Months' cause of the Santa's Village/ Christmas Village. If you're done you can go to Camp John Hay, you can walk because he's close."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The line is long.Try again tomorrow earlier so it will be looser haha
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Perfect for kids and kids at heart 😊 Hmmm it seems a bit pricey for me, 120 pesos each 😅"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,There's traffic but it's worth going
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Overrated. It's great for kids and they will definitely enjoy it. The snow is made of bubbles and is slippery. Just a reminder if you come here you must wear shoes. 120 is the entrance fee for adults.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Didn't get in, the line was too long so sad but still happy"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,The nice thing is the place is small but worth it
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Overrated. Dear oras.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It causes traffic to the country club village residence. Poor us too :( especially since my son works with me every day :( it's nice to be nice but we're poor people who come home from work 😔 pacnxa
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It's a good feeling..
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"It was awesomé, hopefully real ice for unread."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,On the other side of the country club.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Snake only in the morning
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Christmas Village sounds exciting but don't be fooled. The line is too long to enter but you will be met by a small place that can only fit a few people. Not worth the fatigue you see. There are few attractions so check out as well. If you want to spend your Christmas here, it'll be a waste of your time."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Dissapointing. Not worth the entrance fee.The difficulty is getting back to the City. Taxi taxi.guards are inattentive. '' ahead it seems '' tsk
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,No sandals
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,ok hopefully case lacking games
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,the place is super crowded.
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Heart Heart

Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,muddy
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,It's worth it
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,A lot of people
Bell Church,"I wasn’t sure that I really wanted to visit this location. But it is worth the visit. This is a beautiful Temple that still offers a place to come and pray. I can’t begin to imagine the number of people that visited here to pray. The grounds are amazing, quiet and very well preserved. There is a view point that allows you to see the surrounding area, if your willing to do stairs. They invite you to bring your camera’s, but not inside the Temple."
Bell Church,"A known tourist spot here in Baguio City. If you are a peace and nature loving person, then go to this place. A picturesque mountain side which they turned into a temple. This is along the highway going to La Trinidad Benguet. Nearby tourist spot is the Volley of Colors which is just 3 minutes walk."
Bell Church,"Before you reach the Taoist Temple agte, you'll pass thru the street with shops, you will notice that the Taoist walls were not taken care of. On the temple itself, it's fully renovated, newly painted, and newly trimmed landscape. The view from the lower ground is perfect to take photos of the gazebos with statues. Elders would have difficulty climbing up the ladder since it's stiff. They may just stay at the temple."
Bell Church,"Bell Church is a Buddhist Temple. This place is one of the tourist destination of La Trinidad. Open minded people like me will enjoy here. Aside from the beautiful scenery which will welcome you upon entering this place, you will be amazed of the persons personality inside the church of you are not shy to talk to him. You will gain more knowledge about their religion if you are willing to learn. The key is to ask, then you will find the answer."
Bell Church,"Be respectful, this is still a church. It may not be your religion but it is someone's religion and they hold the place with much reverence the way you would for your own church. So I really dislike that there were tourist that were running around or shouting. We were there late in the afternoon and it was a cloudy day. So there are only few tourists but still, some were loud."
Bell Church,"Close to boundary arc of Baguio and La Trinidad, from Baguio this will be the last right corner with a police station. Place is well maintained, there will be alot of stair climbing for this place as well. On the peak of tourist accessible only location is a sight to behold. As far as Ive observed it seems to be a Chinese temple as there were alot of traces of Chinese characters and items relates to it."
Bell Church,The place is well maintained and they also have a lion dance for visitors to watch. Love also the colors of the temple.
Bell Church,It's a really cool place to spend your time. Just got to be ready with the steep stairs and a lot of climbing.It has a parking for a few cars.
Bell Church,"A hidden gem of Baguio city, Bell Church is a Taoist temple that is known to be one of the most peaceful places in the city. A striking pagoda and beautifully landscaped gardens soothe the soul even before you enter the temple. Bells, dragons and flags welcome you to this Chinese temple that is calmly spiritual and incredibly tranquil. There is even a lotus pond that adds to the beauty of this serene temple."
Bell Church,"Bell Church is a Chinese temple of the Chinese Filipino  located in the Baguio-La Trinidad boundaryNo photo opt inside the temple (church), observe silenceBut photo opt in the whole place is of course mayYou may climb up to the highest tower to have an overlook view not just of the church but the neighborhood and houses on the clip of the mountainMinimal fee per pax and car park: p20Souvenirs are available before the main entrance of the place"
Bell Church,Fine place to go to. Car park is limited. No video or picture taking allowed at the temple.
Bell Church,Entrance is only 20.00 per head! Really cool place to take pictures and pray (for Buddhist). Peaceful and quiet. R
Bell Church,This spot is a must to see place for its a place where you can have a peaceful bond with nature while touring in a temple.
Bell Church,"Always a recharging place to visit, the flowers, plants and bamboo trees add tranquility to the place. We got to burn incense sticks there this day inside their temple. No cameras allowed though. They collect 20 pesos for entrance fee, which goes to the upkeep of the place."
Bell Church,"Good place to visit, some steep climbs but good overall specially for pictures/instagram posts"
Bell Church,An accessible place to visit when you are in Baguio or La trinidad. Not much to see but the color and beauty of the place is great.
Bell Church,"Good place to visit. Luckily when we visited, theres a lion dance show. And also you can light up incense stick and stick it in the altar after you are done praying."
Bell Church,"Been here years ago and appreciate it's beauty now, maybe because I don't rush this time 👌"
Bell Church,"Even during a rainy day, the view from the top is still exquisite. It’s worth a visit."
Bell Church,Good for family vacation a lot of places to explore ready your knees for uphill and better view unfortunately we arrive at the place with rainy weather.
Bell Church,"Colors everywhere! Though, I did not climb up the hill to get a better view coz the mini gates were locked. Maybe, when the pandemic is over, they'll open it again."
Bell Church,It was raining when we visited this place.took time to take some pictures. solemn place
Bell Church,There's nothing special about it if you are merely sightseeing. But looking back at its cultural and historical significance and contribution to Baguio will elevate your perspective on it. 5 stars for me. It's more than being IG-able.
Bell Church,I like how they build it. Atractive to the eyes.
Bell Church,💕😘💕😘💕😘💕😘... Stay healthy everyone 😘😘...Nice view and experience
Bell Church,Solemn place. Nice view.
Bell Church,It is unique and peaceful place
Bell Church,"On a random visit, hope that you don't get to chance on a lot of tourists. It's really a temple and it could be a good place for some good reflective walks and a bit of meditations, of course with some picture-taking in between. There are no guides around but you can pretty much take your time in appreciating the views. There is a section, I think an exclusive school, where visitors are not allowed."
Bell Church,"A great place to experience and take a look into the religion and culture of the chinese. No entrance fee. You can take picture everywhere except inside the church. You can enter inside the church but you cannot take pictures inside. There are also places/areas that visitors are restricted to enter, but allowed to take pictures. There are ponds inside with fishes. The area is very clean, so avoid littering. The area has a parking space for small vehicles only. You have to take the stairs to get into the church. The area has a wheelchair ramp. You can take your kids in here but be responsible also in guiding and look at them. Great place to visit in Baguio City."
Bell Church,"Definitely quaint, but one of the most well-kept and active bell churches that I have ever visited. Sure, worth visiting for a selfie."
Bell Church,It was fine and all especially of you're interested in Chinese culture.  But there's nothing there to see. Just the temple and the grounds.  You can't even climb up the higher structures. But you can always just take pictures and pay respect.
Bell Church,PHP30/head + PHP30 for 30-minute parking. Do they expect you to enjoy the place for only 30 minutes?
Bell Church,"Beautiful and peaceful place, we had fun taking pictures around."
Bell Church,Entrance fee of 20 pesos. Clean and atmosphere is good.
Bell Church,"Of the four years of my stay here in Baguio, I only decided to come here today. I don't know, it didn't really peaked my attention and I always thought it would be a mediocre place. But then I was wrong, it was actually a really amazing place. If you haven't visited this place yet, then I suggest you come at once."
Bell Church,I have visited this Temple last time and I have watched some of the martial arts training of a lot of people in here. It was amazing since they are very flexible when it comes to bending and flexing their own movements while practicing. The sculpture and designs of the buildings in here are extravagant and the place has a serene feeling when visiting this place.
Bell Church,"Great place to walk, meditation and get her mind off the busy streets of the city."
Bell Church,"Opens from 8AM to 12noon, and 1:30PM to 4PM . They'll have lunch at 12noon-1:30pm. Better yet go here at 8AM. You won't be paying a fee to enter. Just before the 'Welcome to La Trinidad' signage you'll see the dragon arch and the bridge. You can ask the locals for direction if you're near or lost."
Bell Church,The view from the top is nice because you get to see the houses on hills.
Bell Church,Well maintained chinese temple . colorful. and in some areas are visitors prohibited though.
Bell Church,"A Buddhist temple that is very clean and well maintained. If you are planning to visit with your car, it will be very difficult to park since they have a very limited space for parking so might as well ride a public transportation instead. This is also the first place you'll see before going to the strawberry farm."
Bell Church,Faith and Amazement is in this place... Sobrang unique at ganda ng chinese church na toh..
Bell Church,If you're going to La Trinidad then you can stop by. If you're someone who is into historical stuff you will probably appreciate it just use Google para i translate since nasa Chinese talaga 😅
Bell Church,"Baguio? Then you must visit this place, Bell Church, a chinese church. An IG worthy place, refreahing and peacefull too."
Bell Church,If you want go to Baguio and then before you visit strawberry farm you must visit this place it is a long the way it just like you visit the Chinese temple the view is so beautiful and is sacred place.
Bell Church,It’s the most colorful Buddhist Temple I’ve seen just yet. I didn’t know this kind of place existed in Baguio til 2020 so 5 stars to that!
Bell Church,Bell church brings you the vibe of taiwan or china lol. Because of taoist temple located at la trinidad benguet. This place is awesome. Not so crowded and little cold weather and its very easy tor reach woth from baguio city
Bell Church,"Bell Church is located few steps away from the arch welcoming people to La Trinidad, Benguet. During peak hours the traffic sometimes go bumper to bumper and finding parking spaces both inside and outside the compound relies in luck. The place is good and packed with tourists thus taking pics will be a little tricky. Don't forget that taking pics on the interior of the church is a no-no. Light and offer some incense sticks for good luck."
Bell Church,Beautiful place. Staff were kind enough to let us in even though we arrived just before closing time. Got some amazing photos.
Bell Church,Very much the same feel and aesthetics as with most of the Chinese Temples. Place is well preserved and with a great view once you’ve reached the top.
Bell Church,"One of the finest destination in Baguio. Just observe the silence and the awesome view of bell church . The attachment of green grass and blue sky ,the stairs everything makes it just peace at its best"
Bell Church,"Clean, serene and a nice place, good ambiance, not crowded when we go to this place.. small parking area but with parking assistant who will guide you and make you feel at ease."
Bell Church,"It's a nice location just because their parking tickets don't sound good to me. Since one will get an entrance ticket, there should be no additional payment for parking."
Bell Church,Great Taoist temple!  The only thing is they only allowed one joss stick which is ridiculous as there are 5 Gods and Goddesses. (So minimum should be either 3 or 5) There's actually another Gods which by right should be allowed one or 5 joss sticks. But I guess they don't really know how to pray properly.
Bell Church,I think this is world first Taoism temple with internal Church design. Awesome 👍Suggests to have more history descriptions area instead of photos season by visitors.
Bell Church,Quite peaceful place. You really need your own car or private taxi to reach this place but it's good for a tourist to at least see this place.
Bell Church,Entrance is free though it's kind of hard and tiring to get to the main temple especially for older people. A small place but still worth the while if you're in the area and if you're into temples.
Bell Church,"The Bell Church was founded on August 4, 1960 in Benguet by a Chinese immigrants from Canton, China (now Guangzhou) led by Ng Pee.In 1954, he first preached in a dining hall of a restaurant but eventually transferred the place of worship to his residence along the Kilometer 6 mark in La Trinidad, Benguet due to increasing number of devotees.Then known as the ""Chinese Buddhist Temple"", the temple's membership is composed of primarily ethnic Chinese farmers.Membership continued to grow that the temple had to moved again to its present site along the Kilometer 3 mark in the 1960s and has since then became known as the ""Bell Church"". With support from the local Chinese community, the house in the current site was converted to a temple."
Bell Church,I'd give it a Five if they open the access to the higher level of the place. But overall it's a good place. IG worth pictures can be taken at this place
Bell Church,A Holy place for another religion. When visiting please pay respect. This place is along the way as the Strawberry farm (for Strawberry picking). It is accessible by Jeepney or by Taxi.
Bell Church,"Its okay. A bit crowded thats if your car can get in the limited parking. Inside you can get a few shots for prosperity. Unless you google it, you'd hardly realize its cultural significance."
Bell Church,Nice and solemn place to visit.
Bell Church,"The Bell Church (Chinese Zhongjiao, transl. Bell Religion is a Chinese Filipinoindigenous religious organization based in La Trinidad, Benguet, Philippines. It is led Elias Ng, the Spiritual Leader and Head Administrator of the Bell Church.You can go to take photos for free. it is walking distance from valley of colors in la trinidad bagauio city."
Bell Church,"The place looks really cool,there is an entrance fee of 30 pesos."
Bell Church,"Place is very beautiful with very cool Chinese temple. Although it's very hot in the afternoon, the place is very eye relaxing. I advise that you there around earlier of the day or after 3pm so it's not that hot. You can also be able to enter their temple and learn their culture. The temple upstairs is closed sometimes so I advise you to check their schedule first."
Bell Church,nice experience about chinese beliefs!
Bell Church,"A very well maintained Chinese temple that is worth to stop by and visit.The Bell Church is a Chinese temple of the Chinese Filipino indigenous religious organization of the same name in La Trinidad, Benguet, Philippines."
Bell Church,A well maintained Chinese Temple with inspired young individuals doing Lion Dance regularly.
Bell Church,"Bell Church is a place for serenity of the soul, meditation and peace of mind. Also where young children learn the self-defense, the art and lifestyle of martial arts. Happy Chinese New Year 2020!"
Bell Church,"A place centered on the Chinese Culture, if I'm not mistaken. The place was clean, but there were many renovations and rehabilitations undergoing."
Bell Church,This place reminds you of the distant past .. and how life was at that time .. The landscape surrounding it is amazing.. I am really enjoyed my time there..
Bell Church,"Its a tourist spot in Benguet. You can enter it for free, theres a parking space too. When we arrive there, there were musicians playing festive music. This temple has a greslat mountain view."
Bell Church,Only allowed to stay 30 minutes maximum time only. Basically just taking a photos can only be done here. Need to pay a cheap entrance fee.
Bell Church,Overly commercialized when you get in. Still the sacred place to go when things are uncertain or anything we can celebrate about.
Bell Church,A beautiful flowery place set upon the hillside of baguio. Serene and calming for the soul. Took the time to light an incense stick..
Bell Church,"Chinese temple with intricately designed architectures (bells, pagodas, dragons, etc.); Nice landscape too."
Bell Church,We visit here together with friends. It's a great  place to see naturally the beauty of nature and the church.
Bell Church,Entrance is 20php for just roaming around. The temple as well as the stairs going to the middle up to the top part of the vicinity was close when we went there.
Bell Church,"The place is well maintained, but during my visit the temple wherein you can pick a number and read your luck, was closed."
Bell Church,"Bell Church is a Chinese temple of the Chinese Filipino indigenous religious organization. Besides from the church, they also have a Kung Fu Lesson there."
Bell Church,"A nice temple is located on a hill, the structure is same as Chinese temple can find anywhere. A good place for those looking for peaceful"
Bell Church,This church is very different from usual churches. The architure is Chinese from outside you may feel like you are going to a monastery but when you reach inside you get to know it's church. This place is good for taking pictures. Well maintained and clean. Only thing the entrance to church is very narrow which can keep you awaiting if there is any vehicle coming in from other end.
Bell Church,Awesome place to visit.
Bell Church,"i really like the lion dance performance.,"
Bell Church,"Another beautiful sidetrip if you’re going to La Trinidad. Just a few meters away from the Valley of Colors. This small yet intricate Chinese Temple is less touristry compared to other attractions on Baguio. It has a big and free parking space. This is a good place for meditation with small wishing ponds, dragon and lion sculptures and the scent of incense."
Bell Church,"good place to visit, clean facilities and we got the chance to watch the student practicing their drum for dragon dancing"
Bell Church,The park is clean and gorgeous. The lawn is maintained pretty well. The place is cool and Instagramable.
Bell Church,"Nice place to visit, enjoy the views, and take some pictures,"
Bell Church,A lil bit far from the cityIts better to visit this place kapag hindi masyadong mainitGreat view
Bell Church,Place to rest you mind from usual daily noise and rush. Different world compressed on one small space
Bell Church,not just the bell church but also the stunning view of brazilian-like houses.. #BoyBagito
Bell Church,The place is for lovers of Chinese temple and dragon. A nice place for taking pictures.
Bell Church,Super nice. .
Bell Church,"Very colorful, keep in mind that Bell church is a religious destination, also, these guys love stairs, the highest temple is 5 stories above the octagonal pool"
Bell Church,"Date visited : Aug 25,2019You can dropby to this Buddhist temple on your way to Strawberry farm. It""s a small place and parking is kinda annoying because there's no  enough space for a lot of tourist flocking to this area. It's a bit crowded when we visited this place."
Bell Church,A very nice tourist spot in Baguio. Just near the border of La Trinidad.
Bell Church,It gives Chinese vibes. Very peaceful place.
Bell Church,The view is great from this place. This place is near Stobosa houses.
Bell Church,"It was really fascinating, the place is very pleasing to the eyes 👲⛩️🇨🇳🐲"

Bell Church,The Best Ever for Pictorial and Dating
Bell Church,You really cant do much here... Except take post worthy pictures or instagrammable pics. I didnt ask the person at the entrance if they offer other activities.
Bell Church,I hope they will maintain the beauty of this place..
Bell Church,A good place if your looking for a Chinese Temple in Baguio.
Bell Church,"Bell ChurchBell Church is Chinese Taoist temple and a major tourist destination, having been built in 1960 in the outskirts of Baguio city in La Trinidad, Benguet, Philippines. It is a beautiful, colorful and attractive religious and cultural place on the top of a hill with good-looking setting."
Bell Church,Nice and peaceful place. Deserve a visit.
Bell Church,"Peaceful, quiet and very nice place for visiting tourists."
Bell Church,The place is clran and well maintained. Very relaxing place
Bell Church,Solemn place perfect for people looking for some place to reflect in.
Bell Church,Nothing is new here but the popularity of this Chinese Temple. It's only became a must place one had to visit for curiosity when you are on your way to La Trinidad to buy fresh vegetables.
Bell Church,Solemn place. Very clean and well maintain.
Bell Church,Have different kinds of flowers around and a cozy place...
Bell Church,Beautiful
Bell Church,Place was nice

Bell Church,Very interesting place and I would definitely return.
Bell Church,Good place to visit
Bell Church,The area is so peaceful for those who wanted to relax. If you were lucky enough there is a lion dance scheduled.
Bell Church,Beautiful and well preserved for future generations
Bell Church,Love the place!
Bell Church,One of Baguio's nice tourist spot.
Bell Church,This place is amazing. Going to the temple itself is amusing as there are dragons guiding your way.
Bell Church,Beautiful chinese temple. Easy to go with jeep by own
Bell Church,History fanatics can amuse themselves here with all the Chinese inscriptions around the walls and others
Bell Church,"Sirene place, well kept and clean."
Bell Church,"The place is not so big, but the temple vibe is present. The place is just a minute walk from the highway. Don't drive all the way here, just take a public transpo since going this route often suffers in heavy traffic during the day. It would be nicer if the walls or posts are repainted."
Bell Church,"A little bit neglected, no more fortune reading sadly"
Bell Church,Breath taking view
Bell Church,Bell church is tranquil and lively with its colors..A nice place to visit if youre in a Baguio City Tour..#nasanKaJJ
Bell Church,My first time going to this place but for me it's simple but nice.
Bell Church,"Beautiful church; very well maintained grounds. Can be kinda hard to find. It has its own kinda ""China Town"" before you actually get to the grounds. Only part that was disappointing was we couldn't go up the hill any further than the main entry area. As parts were ""closed"". The chapel section could use a little more beautification. But overall very beautiful. Make sure you drop a donation in the box. And remember the chapel is a ""silent"" area."
Bell Church,The taoist architecture is amazing 😍
Bell Church,Nice place to evaluate youself.
Bell Church,"We got in just as this place opened. A wonderful, well-kept place."
Bell Church,Try to light an incense and donate for the  church.
Bell Church,"As a tourist destination it is a nice place to visit. A walk around the church grounds will give you a unique sight from the usual Baguio vibe. Since it is still a church, following the instructions like no photography, no food and to keep quiet while inside the church should always be followed. A must visit if you are in between Baguio and La Trinidad Benguet"
Bell Church,Nothing to do but take pictures.
Bell Church,"Beautiful place. Obviously it's a church, but it's great background for picture taking. The place has the 'other country' feel in it. It's well-maintained considering the number of tourists who visit the place. Cleanliness is very much observed so just a quick and friendly reminder to all people planning to visit the place: Kindly leave and take nothing aside from memories.The people asigned to watch over the place are not that friendly, but atleast they are accomodating enough. Based on the sign at the gate, they are only open until 4:30 pm for visitors so be guided accordingly. And since you're already there, you migjt want to try the Sinner or Saint's Cafe which is just a few steps away from Bell Church."
Bell Church,"An ok place, not crowded when we get there, just need to pay 20pesos for the entrance fee"
Bell Church,"The place was so quiet , clean and perfect to unwind."
Bell Church,Good new culture experience to FilipinoNot much to me Korean
Bell Church,Chinese temple in Baguio city!
Bell Church,V cool from jeep view
Bell Church,"Its not as crowded as all the other tourist spots in Benguet, there is peace and tranquility. But I dont think people should be locked out of the temple so the keeper can take a lunch break. Praying and meditation should not have a time limit"
Bell Church,Baguio view point. You can reach Bell church before strawberry farm.
Bell Church,The place is so neat and well maintained. This is good for people who want to find peace of mind and relaxation.  Though there are areas in the place restricted to visitors.  Still to whole place is a perfect view.
Bell Church,"Stress free, very relaxing view & perfect place for your family. Well coordinated parking attendants with wide space parking area near the Temple.."
Bell Church,simple place and you can also wish for free.
Bell Church,you can drop by here when you are.going to strawberry farm in Benguet.. it will give you an out of this country experience.. the cons here was the entrance of this place.. the gate was stalled by some kind of sari sari stores that lessen the value of the place..
Bell Church,People are friendly but no knowledge about the religion belief of this Buddhism church. Parking is not a problem bcuz we went there early in the morning. FYI parking is so limited and street leading to this place is too narrow.
Bell Church,"Calm, serene, quiet. A picturesque temple situated in a mostly Christianized locale, the Bell Church is a nice getaway from the hustle a bustle of the busy Baguio City and La Trinidad township."
Bell Church,Just taken some pictures. Nothing special if your looking for a great place to hang out. But the structures are cool though. Nice for picture taking.
Bell Church,Peaceful place with a relaxing ambience
Bell Church,"Very good place, serene, and you can have your fortune be read in the temple....and if you're lucky you can watch the kids there practice the lion or dragon dance ..m"

Bell Church,"Too much sightseers! Sanctity of the place is losing out.Once inside temple, you can pray and offer prayer."
Bell Church,Sooo peaceful :)
Bell Church,The male staff inside the church is very friendly and accommodating. He took time to explain how to say your prayers and wishes. 😘
Bell Church,tourist spot in trinidad a church that maintain by the chinese community of benguet but unfortunately you can't go inside and take picture inside the temple it's prohibited
Bell Church,Nice place to visit and take photos. Sweeping view of the city from the top. Well maintained place. Parking is tight during weekends.
Bell Church,The place obviously is historical. I really enjoyed the peace and quiet. And also the solemnity of the place. Kudos to the people who maintains the place.
Bell Church,Nice stopover before heading to La Trinidad. Chinese temple with view of Baguio hillside. Free entrance and has limited parking space.

Bell Church,Great scenery in Baguio!
Bell Church,Nice place to visit
Bell Church,I love the scenery .. The clouds and the fogs are heavy .. it's just like dry ice. Hehe. The experience here is ok. The detours on the road are confusing and the security is quite strict because of covid 19. But overall satisfied. She is ok.
Bell Church,"We stopped by to have our memories shot through a lens, as soon as we entered we tasted the 15 pesos ice candy. Even though it's expensive, the taste is a winner.. I hope tourists don't be rude and rude.. it's a good place, but it might be scary at night.."
Bell Church,"At present, admission requires registration and a fee of 20p. Temples are indeed rare in a country of Catholicism. It still takes a little lung capacity to walk up. Toilets are clean."
Bell Church,It's also very beautiful ♥️ amazing. it's tiring to walk up but the view is worth it. really clean
Bell Church,"I highly recommend this to touristsThe entrance fee is cheap, the place is clean and quiet, but there is not much to do here. Just a picture picture HAHAHHA"
Bell Church,Entrance fee is about 20 pesos per person.It was nice to see a Buddhist temple in a place where Christianity was dominant.
Bell Church,"It's also a very nice spot. it's cold when you're up there, it's also full so the view gives good vibes. ❤️⭐"
Bell Church,Organized from entry to exit. It’s worth the Php20/pax and Php20 parking fee for the view you’ll get
Bell Church,"Very boring attractions, I may see too much, but the locals like to go there very much"
Bell Church,"Bell Church is a Chinese temple that has great views from above. Nice place and good to take pictures. What you see in the pictures is what you get. Nothing much to do here since church/temple kasi talaga siya na ginawang public lang for people to visit. Just 15 to 20 minutes, you're okay with the place. I also can't hang out for too long since there is little shade."
Bell Church,The place is nice but don't go upstairs. The view at the top is not that good.
Bell Church,It's nice to take pictures here. No entrance fee. It's not our name that climbs to the top. I'm sure it's beautiful there too hehe.
Bell Church,Another good side trip. The colors of stobosa are also neaeby
Bell Church,Not worth the entrance Because when we went this November it was only closed in the upper part
Bell Church,Nice place. It should really be added to the place to visit here in La Trinidad
Bell Church,It was a pity that I couldn't enter.
Bell Church,"I feel like I'm stuck.. I'm tired from climbing..😅😅 I want to go up there at the top because it's still closed, maybe I just fixed it."
Bell Church,"It's very ordinary and not worth seeing, but for Filipinos, it is just suitable to take some photos with flowers and greens."
Bell Church,I visited on Sunday but couldn't enter the building up the stairs in the back
Bell Church,no one when we went ..My friendship is the only place for the two of us   
Bell Church,"To Taiwanese, ordinaryAnd the place to go up was closed.Bye for peace!"
Bell Church,haha i can't read the chinese ksi😅
Bell Church,The place is okay.. But they should have opened the upper place
Bell Church,"Unfortunately, Corona didn't see the bell 😅 but the rest was also worth seeing"
Bell Church,Very beautiful. I miss you immediately Baguio
Bell Church,Here at the bell church 1m/10 is super beautiful
Bell Church,The lane and the limited parking lot are small so if you have a car it is difficult to park
Bell Church,"The space is small, it's nice to take pictures"
Bell Church,It is only suitable for taking a simple photo to prove that you have been here
Bell Church,The beauty of the place really is in every corner the beauty of the view as if you were not in the Philippines
Bell Church,I did not like it and I advise not to go to it ... There is nothing in it except that it is only a temple
Bell Church,Nice
Bell Church,It's a beautiful temple. Photos in the main hall were NG.
Bell Church,She has a nice sights ..
Bell Church,Do not forget .. To enter the temple keep silence
Bell Church,#BellChurch
Bell Church,OK. there is not much to see here
Bell Church,I have not gone!?!
Bell Church,The beauty and the quiet here.
Bell Church,It's nice here..
Bell Church,WowJ
Bell Church,The road is tight
Bell Church,Beautiful
Bell Church,good
Bell Church,"Tickets are 20p.took a lot of photos.It is not difficult to climb up. Simple fitness. Visit here on September 11, 2022."
Good Shepherd Convent,"they open 8:15am until 4pm but it's better to be there earlier, because the gate hasn't opened yet but the queue is long. Also, not all products are available, every day there are different products available gaya ng cookies pero ung ube laging available!"
Good Shepherd Convent,"What’s the hype about it?  Ube jam made by the convent sisters ( and strawberry jam but sold out at this time) Decided to check out the convent but (apparently) the only thing to do here is buy from their store (which you can also buy outside for additional 100 pesos).  Tip:  buy from the resellers if you see a long queue as they’re legit Ube and the convent sisters approved their reselling, you get to help the sisters and the small merchants at the same time."
Good Shepherd Convent,"We all know that their products are so good, resellers/scalpers flock the area as early as possible to be able to queue many times. Most products are out of stock as early as 9am, we were just able to buy two 12oz of Ube, ₱350 each. Resellers sell this for ₱400 to ₱500 pesos in the market. They even sell just in the entrance of Good Shepherd, they’re making a business out of someones business. It is annoying but we can’t do anything about it. We just don’t buy from these resellers."
Good Shepherd Convent,"This is where you can get quality ube jam. The only downside is the long lines. If you're in a rush to buy ube jam, you can go to one of the nearby stalls, albeit the price will be a bit higher."
Good Shepherd Convent,"There's a long line for buyers when we went here on Monday, took us roughly 30mins to an hour. They have chairs set to line but there are portions exposed to the sun, hopefully they can organize it better.They only use paper bags since they don't support the use of plastics, they offer P45 ecobag or cartons for big orders only, so better if you bring your own ecobag. Ube jam bottles are not wrapped on papers, its less secured.Product taste and quality-wise, exceptional as ever."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Manage your expectations. In order for the manufacturers to maintain the quality of their products, they have only limited stocks for sale everyday. Hence, buyers should flock the store early in the morning to avoid shortage. When we went there, the strawberry jam was unavailable. Max of 2 bottles of ube jam are allowed per person. Others may be purchased more than 2 perhaps. They also offer other products."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Although there is a long qeue of lines, its stil best to buy your pasalubong, knowing its new or still fresh stocks compared to the market"
Good Shepherd Convent,"Long line, then limited piece per order for snowballs. Imagine a tourist from manila mostly booked in a hotel. Going from the hotel paying almost 200 pesos for the taxi fare finding out that they can buy only 1 pieces of sbowballs? What? You think we dont have families and friends to give pasalubong? Someday It will be your loss."
Good Shepherd Convent,Long line so go here early. They also have a limit on the quantity of items you will buy to discourage reselling.They also have a bdo pos terminal so they can accept debit and credit cards.
Good Shepherd Convent,Good products but it's too haggard to fall in line. Their service is slow.
Good Shepherd Convent,"Always a good time for a visit though queue can be a little painful. Each person can only get 2 bottles of ube jam.Counter 1 credit and debit cards - can be cashCounter 2 cash - but can accept cardsCounter 3, 4 & 5 - close when we visit but check out my photoCounter 6 - Priority lane for Senior Citizen, elderly, pregnant and PWDs.For prices please check my photos"
Good Shepherd Convent,We arrived past 11am the ube and strawberry jam was completely sold out. Was advised to come as early as 8am. Numbers are distributed. One person gets to buy 2 bottles for each type of product. Parking wasn’t so bad
Good Shepherd Convent,The product is good. Though my bad experience is the lengthy lines and took me 3 hours before I was able to purchase the ube jam and os limited to 4 bottles only. I suggest you to buy during weekdays and avoid saturdays and sundays.
Good Shepherd Convent,"No one leaves Baguio without Good Shepherd Convent goodies. Bestsellers - Ube Jam (usually out of stock, so come here early), Strawberry Jelly and Lengua de Gato. Just recently, we tried their new cookies - Hermits (chewy, with raisins and cashew nuts) and Alfajor (with caramel filling)...and we loved it."
Good Shepherd Convent,"If you want to indulged in the best ube and strawberry jams, peanut brittles and other food pasalubongs for your family and friends, then this is the best place in Baguio for that. Though their price is a little bit pricier than those of our establishments, they made it up by their unparalled quality. The place in itself is already a good spot for picture taking."
Good Shepherd Convent,"A popular destination in bagiuo for the strawberry jam and preserves. Strawberry jams and jellies are the most popular item but they also sell blueberry jam, pickles, peanut brittle among others. In the compound people come in bus loads. They have a grotto with a wonderful view of Mine's View Park and the valley. And also don't forget to stop by the Magnolia ice cream parlor near the front."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Years and years after, Good Sheperd Ube is one the best if not the best tasting ube in the Philippines. If its your first time in Baguio this is a must try.Thankfully these days they now have parking lot adequate enough for most. But if you are going to Mines View then I suggest to park there and walk for a hundred meters to Good Sheperd so that you don’t need to drive on the other side of the entrance because its one way traffic.There is an abundance of “Pasalubong” here but they are really known for the ube. Don’t go late in the afternoon because its most likely out of stock.There is a nice view deck and station of the cross with a nice looking garden too.FYI senior citizen discount is not honored here. See one of my photo to see the banner announcement."
Good Shepherd Convent,I don't know about you but but visit to Baguio is not complete without buying Good Shepherd's Ube (Yam). Always look forward to visiting this place especially during weekends when there aren't much lines when purchasing food souvenirs.
Good Shepherd Convent,1 ube jam and 1 snowball lang per person
Good Shepherd Convent,"A beautiful convent famous for ube jam, strawberry jams & jellies, crinkles, lengua, and other delicacies. A bit expensive compared to market products but the quality is one of the best. Buying their products can also be a means of helping Cordillera Youth thru college.Nice view at the viewdeck, clean restrooms accepting donations for maintenance, and ample parking space. A must visit in Baguio, but could be very crowded on long weekends & peak season."
Good Shepherd Convent,"The only place where you can buy authentic Good Shepherd products(yes, it has no authorized resellers). Products here are true to their weight unlike the fake ones outside. Plus buying here ensures that you are also helping their scholars. There is also a limit when buying some of their famous products like ube jam.Other things to see here:*Limited parking inside*Clean Restroom*Snack bar/coffee shop/ ice cream bar*rare Bagras tree, aka rainbow eucalyptus/rainbow tree(pardon me for being a tree nerd 😊)"
Good Shepherd Convent,"Go here to buy their product. Buy their signature products like must buy item Ube jam (purple yam jam), lengua de gato, peanut brittle, snowball (underrated one!) and others! And my personal favorite is cinnamon loaf from cafe of Good Shepherd. Try it when it's still hot :DAnd they have a good view on the right side of store. Their view deck has a good view. So don't miss it!+ they have some religious contents so if you are catholic, you can try the passage of Jesus."
Good Shepherd Convent,Another legacy place to buy Strawberry and Taro Jams and other foodies. Their product deserve the 5* rating.
Good Shepherd Convent,"Selling great tasting sweets and/or pastries.  The cost is higher compared to the products that you can see along the streets because the reason is definitely the difference in quality.  This is the only place where I will get my ""pasalubongs"" whenever I am in Baguio.  The place has a spot (Sheperd's gallery), which is less congested and has better view compared to mines view park."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Best UBE in the Philippines! They keep the lid open because the ube is still hot, that's how fresh the ube is. Store closes at 5PM. They have a small viewing deck overlooking the valley. Clean comfort rooms. Ample parking space."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Best place to buy some souvenirs, much cheaper than what is being selled on other places. It also has great view overlooking mines view."
Good Shepherd Convent,Aside from different known Baguio delicacies to buy here of course our faves Good Shepherd products...we just love the surround place with flower plants that catched by our eyes 😘
Good Shepherd Convent,"Cheaper to buy here than buy Good Shepherd products within Baguio.And all-time favorites are available. If you buy many products, it'll be packaged in a box. :)"
Good Shepherd Convent,Best blueberry and strawberry jam! Too crowded on weekends or long holidays! Parking is insufficient
Good Shepherd Convent,"This is a must-go to place for pasalubong (food treat gifts) shopping.  They manufacture originally-made food items such as peanut brittle, ube (yam), crinkles, lengua de gato, peanuts and other sweet snacks.While there, be sure to visit the Shepher's Gallery which is also a viewing deck for a clear view of the Baguio mountain ridges.They have ample parking so be sure to make space for the various food treats you'll bring home."
Good Shepherd Convent,Just walking distance from mines view park (400 meters)They have a view spot as well but the major activity there is to buy souvenir. Their Ube jam is known as the best ube jam in Philippines. And they have more options like strawberry jam and raw Ube and...Their ube jam starts at 210 pesos for 12oz and 350 for 24oz.
Good Shepherd Convent,"If youre buying jams2 bottles per person onlyP350 per bottle, as of nowNo parking inside, you can park up to the mines view area"
Good Shepherd Convent,This place is filled with tourists who buy Pasalubong. What I like about the store is that the crew handles the transaction quickly. The prices are a bit expensive but they said that every purchase helps them send people to school. The ube jam is their popular product here.
Good Shepherd Convent,Overrated and over priced products. Unruly queue and the management careless of the condition as long as they are selling out. There are alot of resellers queueing and some even take multiple numbers to get more products.Sad that this place is supposed to be run by nuns and of religious order.
Good Shepherd Convent,Famous strawberry and ube jam are sold here. You can get it while its still hot.
Good Shepherd Convent,easier to go there commuting via jeepney.Place is very clean.
Good Shepherd Convent,"Their Uber jams are still the best. Though it is quite expensive now, your Baguio trip wouldn't be complete without buying some."
Good Shepherd Convent,1. Pricey but quality and excellent products2. Lovely view3. Good place to park for free 😁4. Clean restrooms
Good Shepherd Convent,"Still good. Lowest prices of pasalubong like ube jam peanut brittle 180 medium canister, 180 strawberry jelly etc.all are too cheap.nice place to visit too"
Good Shepherd Convent,"Dear Mountain maid management. We love your products. We go to your center to buy freshly made ube jam rather than in the palengke. But we have a problem when we have to fall in line for more than 2 hours in your ""11 item & up"" lane because some guys buy box loads of your products. Maybe you can make another lane exclusively for these wholesale buyers? At the moment, you only have 1 lane active in your ""11 items & up"".Update: finally got my order at 11am. I wasn't able to buy 4 lengua ge gato because 3 wholesale buyers ahead of me bought all your stock. Its ironic that you kept on broadcasting over your PA system that you dont have any other authorized dealer and yet you allow these unauthorized dealers to buy out all your stock. This leaves us tourists with no choice but to buy from them minus your guarantee of freshness."
Good Shepherd Convent,Best place for pasalubongs. Quality product as always
Good Shepherd Convent,"If you want a good buy for pasalubongs. This convent is it. Not only you get to help the students they support, you get to take home the best Ube jam and other jams from the city. I walked in late afternoon and was told at the gate that it's all sold out. Best to come by in the morning. Since it's the pandemic, there are no students who make the jams. There's a seller just right outside the gate but they are more expensive compared to buying the jam at the convent."
Good Shepherd Convent,"The products there are awesome and yummy, the employees are helpful and friendly, and the scenery is breathtaking; worth to have picture taking there. Enjoy!!!"
Good Shepherd Convent,"A tourist in Baguio?Had to visit outside Baguio?Make sure to drop by here and get some Baguio's Finest..Must try's are..Strawberry Jam, Strawberry Preserve, Ube Jam and more..#nasanKaJJ"
Good Shepherd Convent,Very clean amidst the pandemic. The guard will spray your vehicle upon entry. Only a select variety of products are sold compared to what they were selling previously.
Good Shepherd Convent,You can buy good products of Baguio as pasalubong
Good Shepherd Convent,"As a tourist, you got here to buy your ""pasalubong"". Long lines all the time. You can relax a bit if you fan find a seat in the small cafe there."
Good Shepherd Convent,Posted some prices. The view deck was amazing as well.
Good Shepherd Convent,"The place was small just for picture taking, in here you will buy the best and legit souvenirs such as jams, there very unique UBE JAM and STRAWBERRY JAM, you can also buy there turmeric tea it was delicious and very healthy.Great thing is that if you buy products in this place you can help a lot of children to go to school and provide there materials in studying."
Good Shepherd Convent,The best goodies you can pick from in Baguio.Must try- Ube jam
Good Shepherd Convent,Delicious pasalubong for the family back home.
Good Shepherd Convent,"If you're looking for quality ""pasalubong"" or Baguio delicacies, this is the place for you! But you better think of what items to buy because the prices are not cheap! They have the price list on their website but to give you an idea, the Ube Jam is at P230 and the Choco Flakes is P295! But I tell you they're really good and you can rest assured that they're of good quality and not expired! They have a small view deck and it's also something that you can check out if you're not lining up to buy pasalubong! If you plan to visit and buy items from them, please allot 1.5 hours - my sister-in-law and I lined up for that long just to buy stuff! Not sure if it's faster if you line up with a car though.They also have a cafe that has great coffee and bread! You can also buy organic products there and you don't need to line up because it has a separate building. I was not able to try their ice cream but I heard that it's really good too!"
Good Shepherd Convent,"My favorite Baguio goodies. Your trip isn't complete without stopping by here to buy Ube Jam, Strawberry Jam, Lengua and other Baguio specialties. They sell cheaper here than stores and kiosks outside. It is better to come early as they don't have much stocks in the afternoon."
Good Shepherd Convent,This place is packed almost every day of buyers from every place. They offer wide selection of jams and other product that are made here by locals. They are famous for their UBE Jam the small one cost around 5 dollars or around 250 pesos. If you are here better buy in bulk because the price here is much cheaper than outside. They also have an observation deck that have an amazing view of the mountain range
Good Shepherd Convent,"Good products, fair price, friendly staff, accessible to public utility vehicles"
Good Shepherd Convent,"Of course, for quality pasalubongs like strawberry jams and jellies and peanut brittle, this is The Place to be!"
Good Shepherd Convent,The place is popular for their pasalubongs especially the ube jam. They also have other sweets to open and also offers two types of coffee which are mild and strong.They have restrooms. Parking gets crowded on weekends so come early or before lunch. You could check out mines view first to pick up cheap items as give aways.You could also use your credit card. They have an overlooking view as well.
Good Shepherd Convent,"Many go there only because of their quality products: ube and strawberry jams, peanut brittle, etc. However, there is poor crowd control and the facility can no longer handle the huge number of customers. It will take you a LOOONG time waiting in line just to buy, and they ration the goods you can buy (2 ube jam per person in line). A victim of its own success and over tourism."
Good Shepherd Convent,"the place has improved a lot. there's lots of parking spaces. they provided an orderly way of placing your order. they have landscaped areas good for photo snaps. they have snack area for a quick munch, coffee or ice cream."
Good Shepherd Convent,I love how systematic they get orders from customers especially ones who were buying in bulk. Credit card facility is also available. Easy transportation since there are many taxis in the area. With a parking lot for customers who bring their rides. With a little coffee shop at the side and a restroom for those who just want to stay and see the view.
Good Shepherd Convent,"this is probably the best place you can find in Baguio for your souvenirs and pasalubong needs. From accessories, ornaments, snacks, anything very Baguio like and of course the famous Good Shepherd products. We always go here to buy Good Shepherd Ube in a Jar."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Delicious ube jam and strawberry jam and many other sweets.. However,  to avoid waiting too long to buy some goodies because of too many customers, one should go there early or rather a bit late in the afternoon to avoid delay.. Too many people during weekends.."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Before going to other tourist attractions, drop by at the Good Shepard Convent to get your favorite local jams and biscuits. Their Ube Jam is just the right blend of soft and sweetness. Bring your family and friends because each person can only buy 2 bottles of ube jam per day."
Good Shepherd Convent,"If you want to buy quality souvenir products from Baguio then this is the place. They have a variety of products to choose from although a bit expensive from other product brands, the taste is worth it.They have also a view deck where you can take good pictures."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Ube jam, strawberry jam, strawberry candy and adobo peanuts are the best!!"
Good Shepherd Convent,"The best place to purchase some signature Baguio pasalubong. Their improved store front system lets people come in and purchase what they need quickly and with less hassle than ever. They also are capable of credit card transactions.Parking is limited and, as of this writing, construction and winding roads in the are make getting there a bit challenging."
Good Shepherd Convent,Nice place and goodies! It's good to think that we are also being able to help by buying the goods they sell. Hope they could already finish construction of theroads going to the place. Baguio really have one of the worst traffic situation in yhe country. Still one of the most beautiful places though.
Good Shepherd Convent,"One of Baguio's tourist traps. As much as I love their Ube Jam, most of the items they offer are overpriced. That viewing deck is better than Mines View, though!"
Good Shepherd Convent,"Good Shepherd is the place to go to for a delicious Ube Jam you can find only in Baguio. Other products are offered here, you can also try their Strawberry Jam, Peanut Brittle, and one of my favorite Snowballs and a lot more. There is also a place to take pictures with the beautiful  Baguio mountain region as your backdrop."
Good Shepherd Convent,"As always, the quality of their products were at the top but somehow nothing is very new. But still if you want to bring some pasalubong from baguio that will assure high ratings from the taste buds, this is the place to go since others outside may be cheaper vut don't taste as good"
Good Shepherd Convent,"There was never a time that I've visited Baguio and not see this place. The Ube they sell is just the best that it doesn't match the ube of their same convent in Tagaytay (this may just be psychological though since they are packaged differently). My mama loves the ube so much that its the only pasalubong she requests from me when in Baguio. One thing i noticed earlier is that they have displayed pictures of their scholars. Buying their products surely is a delicious way of helping out. When your in the area, try the coffee place by the gazebo. They serve Benguet brewed coffee and Civet coffee."
Good Shepherd Convent,Loved it here - the ube jam and strawberry preserves and of course the view! I just wish they won't put a limit though on how many bottles one can buy. It's such a shame.
Good Shepherd Convent,"Most popular place to buy your Baguio pasalubongs, but parking is terrible here so try to come early or have someone hazard for you while you shop. Come prepared by knowing what to buy, usually people come for the ube jam (4 orders per person only) the alfajores, oatmeal cookies, and the strawberry jam. Its easier for them if you write down your order ahead so you can just hand them your piece of paper and they will prepare everything for you. They accept DEBIT, EPS and credit cards as well."
Good Shepherd Convent,Very nice place. Offers a lot of delicacies from Baguio. Arrive early caue you might end up waiting in line for more than 30 minutes. Hope they can increase limit of buying Ube jam.
Good Shepherd Convent,"We were so lucky we came in early as for the previous reviews we knew the place would be packed. Be early as 8am, the amount you'll get for pasalubongs might be limited for certain items. Be sure to bring bags."
Good Shepherd Convent,"All the products are good and pricey. However, remember that you indeed help Igorot youth to go to college when you buy their pasalubong products. As always, buy the ube jam and strawberry spread. If you want to try something different, try their alfajor and strawberry juice."
Good Shepherd Convent,"They are very systematic, from parking onto selling. Since their products are yummy and clean so versus the price it's a bit expensive pero okay na rin, kasi nga masarap naman at malinis.  I recommend to make buying early in the morning to avoid difficulty in parking."
Good Shepherd Convent,"This is the best place to buy food ""pasalubong"" or gifts for loved ones who weren't able to join you in your vacation. :) Ube jam is the most commonly bought, but this lasts for only a month... :( So, my favorite is the Alfajor - freeze it and it's delicious frozen! :)"
Good Shepherd Convent,"Generations-old place where people get their ‘pasalubong’ (gifts) before leaving Baguio. There’s an interesting market down the road so it’s worth it to come by, but I honestly think their products have way too much sugar."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Be sure to look for their ube, strawberry, and blueberry jams. They are must have items if you are visiting Baguio and looking for souvenirs. Please be reminded to be wary of imitations so buy from their store as much as possible."
Good Shepherd Convent,"It has a great view from Good Shepherd. But most of the tourist or traveler wants to bring some goodies from good shepherds. Well honestly all the pastry and pasalubong are great!!! Maybe they need to add more pay booth to lessent the long line. I have to wait 30 minutes to get ube jam, snowballs. Only 2 ube jam per customer."
Good Shepherd Convent,"It is home to of some of the best goodies from Baguio, or even the whole of Benguet. Just be sure you know what to buy first then be prepared to fall in line. Their peanut butter however, is bland. We get ours from BSU in La Trinidad. If you're taking the taxi, ask the driver to wait with the meter running. It's difficult getting another to go back to the city."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Step 1: Bring a bag because they do not give bags for your orders. Also, bring pen and paper because they accept written orders and people hog the paper and the pens. Bring your own!Step 2: Do not bring a car if you are not willing to wait long. Parking is limited and the guard lets cars in as parking spaces are vacated.Step 3: if you plan to have some bread or empanada with coffee, do so before buying your goods.Step 4: Write on a piece of paper all your orders and fall in line. Have good company or a decent video game during the wait."
Good Shepherd Convent,I always visit. This last time road is being fixed. Found my way around it. The set up a new outlet at the parking lot. Same old sought after goodies.
Good Shepherd Convent,Should have visited earlier than 10am to get some big ube jam and snow balls. Bought strawberry jelly and alfajor. Ube jam increased cost from 200 to 210php.A dedicated area for listing your purchases is a genius idea. Convenient for undecided traveller on a budget.
Good Shepherd Convent,"This is still the best place for ube jam. The Good Shepherd in Tagaytay also serves ube jam, but the Baguio version is still better.The queue for the goods are so long, and the view deck is now cramped. There used to be a large view deck here overlooking Mines View but now the deck is 1/4 its original size."
Good Shepherd Convent,"This is where you can buy whole lot of Good Shepherd's best ever Ube Jam! Now with more selection from Lengua (milky cookies) and Strawberry Jam and Sagada Arabica Coffee. Much much much cheaper than what you can get from the market--well, good things come from 'higher places' in Baguio. Hihihi"
Good Shepherd Convent,We got here early to beat the crowds. THE PLACE for pasalubong from Baguio. Sweet treats plus coffee! The girls will box your order up for you.
Good Shepherd Convent,Products are quite expensive but way better than others.
Good Shepherd Convent,"Prepare to bring some patience when you line up for everything. Pro tip - if you have a friend with you, split up and one should take the line to buy stuff (ubo, sweets, pasalubongs) then the other one should line up for the ice cream. Take pictures later that doesn't have a line. Ice cream tip - get the mangos those are amazing. Get more than a scoop (differnt flavors) coz we had to line up again coz it was that good."
Good Shepherd Convent,Good Shepherd is known for their delicious pasalubongs in Baguio. It is just walking distance from Mines view park. I highly recommend this to everyone visiting the place. Their Ube Jam is my favorite. ❤ Will definitely go back here and buy more pasalubongs. Just don' t forget to bring your own ecobags! 😊
Good Shepherd Convent,"Great place to buy your ""pasalubong"". this is also the home for their famous Ube (Purple Yam) Jam.  It would be great to buy early morning as tourist tend to fill the area as the day goes by."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Very organized, as this is the last stop to get all thr pasalubong (food wise) for home. There is a good view of the mines where you can have a good photoshoot. Buy your strawberry, ube jams and so on here. Crowded on peak days and hours. Parking available but limited based on the volume of people going"
Good Shepherd Convent,ube jam out of stock ! per person in the line are allowed only to purchase 8 bottles
Good Shepherd Convent,You will love to see the view here! You can also buy delicacies which personally made by Monks residing in the Good Shepherd Convent.
Good Shepherd Convent,"Still the same ube and alphajor goodness. Long lines though. Better write down what you want to buy for faster transactions. Sometimes due to peak seasons, they limit the number of jars you can buy per person."
Good Shepherd Convent,"This is where you buy legit and high quality pasalubongs from Baguio. You already participate in charity works just by buying the products. Albeit the high price, ""You help send Cordillera youth to college each time you buy their products"" as per their slogan."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Really pricy.Some delicacies where out of stock.Discipline line for customers.If you're on a walk, it will really cost you energy since the path to the place is really steepBut their jams are the real deal. Especially the Ube jam."
Good Shepherd Convent,Viewing deck is nice.Prices of pasalubong goods is expensive. Foreign and locals will have a second thought of buying their goods.
Good Shepherd Convent,"If you visit Baguio City, don't forget to visit Good Shepherd. They offer good qualities and affordable goodies like Strawberry jam, Ube jam, Orange marmalade, Peanut Brittle, Lengua de Gato and many more!"
Good Shepherd Convent,"Best place to buy purple yam, strawberry jam and some baguio delicacies to bring home to friends and family. Their products are more expensive compared to other local vendors."
Good Shepherd Convent,"famous ""pasalubong"" place. you can buy several delicacies/treats here ranging from 250 - 500 php  (5 - 10 usd) which are also tasty. I recommend you try the ube jam here"
Good Shepherd Convent,I love their cookies.  My husband loves their jams.  My son loves their crinkles.  We always visit their cafe after shopping for their empanada and coffee!
Good Shepherd Convent,"Who doesn't love the famous ube jam in Baguio. P350 big jar of ube jam compare to P400 in the market or any outside store. Though the road going up to Good Shepherd is under renovation, so we needed to walk up to it."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Make sure to visit this place to buy some ube jam, peanut brittle and so much more."
Good Shepherd Convent,Famous for their delectable Ube jam and Lengua de gato... they have varieties of sweets that are equally delicious. The good thing aboutGood Shepherd is they were able to send a lot of youths to college by the profits they got from these goodies. So if you buy from them you also help in giving good education to our youth.
Good Shepherd Convent,Good products and delicious foods.
Good Shepherd Convent,"They sell the best local goods and treats!!! Although there is no parking within the convent, it's worthit to walk it. Also outside the convent is where you should park and also where ministores are found"
Good Shepherd Convent,"Still the best stopp to buy your take home delicacies.This place is alway packed with tourist and locals for their jams, cookies, concentrated fruit juices."
Good Shepherd Convent,Eco-friendly place. Well maintained premises and variety of artisan products for sale. The coffee shop prices are very reasonable.
Good Shepherd Convent,"ang sarap ng ube jam...higit sa lahat, syempre, the place was quite, relaxing, cold, welcoming and sacred.Please find time to visit Good Shepherd - Baguio City and avail there high quality products. Your money will benefits the education of Cordillera Youths."
Good Shepherd Convent,"strawberry jam, ube jam, choco crinkles, peanut brittle, and many many more. this is the ultimate pasalubong place in Baguio City. items are made by the Good Shepherd nuns and proceeds are used to sponsor many of their charity works."
Good Shepherd Convent,"We've been here for the 1st time last Jan. 1, 2016, ang daming mabibiling pasalubong like but with quality naman. I was also advised by my co-employee to buy him minatamis na ube."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Buy pasalubongs and help a good cause. They are famous for their ube jam but I'm telling you, you should buy their chocolate crinkles and civet coffee! Delish!"
Good Shepherd Convent,"Good to buy jams, spread, jelly, lengua and other foods for a pasalubongReady your pockets cause thenproducts are a bit expensive yet delicious."
Good Shepherd Convent,Not recommended to go back.the system they have is so poor.they asked to fall in line and open by 8am.the queue is too long when they go inside the store the line is not followed.guard is so strict but doesn’t know how to maintain theirRules.if they asked to fall in line in the middle of the rain they should follow the line inside the store.what is the used ofFalling in line and strict rules if not followed?ayusin nyo sistema nyo kami ang nagpapasok ng income s lugar nyo kun lahat kayo masasama ugali wala n pupunta s inyo.
Good Shepherd Convent,Please please please do buy here nalang instead sa labas because the money (some) is used for donation. Every peso counts!p.s Their Ube Jam is soooo delicious!!
Good Shepherd Convent,"When I first went to Good Shepherd, I was shocked by the prices of their products. But I thought to give it a try to see what the hype was about. Needless to say, it was worth every penny. Most especially their peanut brittle which was true to its name; it's really brittle and was just a pleasure to munch on. Most peanut brittles I've had in the past should be called ""peanut chewy"". Good Shepherd's Peanut Brittle is the real deal."
Good Shepherd Convent,Great place to buy pasalubong when in Baguio.They have a church where you can attend Sunday mass.  It's near a market place and Mines view.
Good Shepherd Convent,"Angel cookies are very tasty. Prices are a bit higher than expected, but profit goes to college scholarships so I don't mind. 😊"
Good Shepherd Convent,"buying of pasalubong was very orderly, there is also limit of the jams so that everyone can enjoy their popular items."
Good Shepherd Convent,The best ube jam and lengua de gato. The parking area is being expanded from time to time. Beautiful collection of garden flowers. Fast service. Lots of counters to avoid long queue.
Good Shepherd Convent,Great food products especially the  ube jam. A tedious walk away from Mines View Park but very accessible if you a vehicle. Worth the side trip.
Good Shepherd Convent,Expect long lines to get a freshly made Ube Jam.
Good Shepherd Convent,"HelloWeve visited good shepherd on nov 23 2016 and we bought  some of the ube jam & peanut butter,So sad di na po namin na check the product expiration date.

Good Shepherd Convent,Relaxing place
Good Shepherd Convent,Expect to spend at least 1.5 hours to queue. Ang dami pa mahilig sumingit na senior and preggy.Limit of 2 bottles of ube and 1 peanut brittle. Snowballs and Lengua were sold out
Good Shepherd Convent,"Too many tourists, too long a queue of resellers and local residents who want to buy Good Shepherd products. Mejo, the progress of the queue is not okay. Actually, except for the tourists lane, only one lane of resellers has been running before. Do I know Kay kuyang guard .. It's just sad and I didn't buy a snowball .. I was already in line at 10 am, 1pm passed almost sold out of almost the products. I hope the residents alternate with tourists for the fair."
Good Shepherd Convent,the GS product is legit and truly tasteful. a must visit for pasalabong when you are in baguio.try their UBE JAM! the best of all
Good Shepherd Convent,"A large structure and a great business run by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd.A religious theme park with various statues, a Training Center, but above all, a large business selling bottled food products."
Good Shepherd Convent,It's just a waste of time queuing here. Queued for 2hrs + got hit by heavy rain. I hope every hour there will be an update if you still have ube jam in stock!!    The queue is so long that it's out of stock.
Good Shepherd Convent,Overhyped Ube Jam in my opinion.I tried another Ube Jam along Mines View and still tastier than Good Sheperd Ube Jam.Some of you for 350 pesos then not so delicious. It's okay to eat but it's not good to stuff.
Good Shepherd Convent,Until the reception only visitors at this time. You write your orders and pay at the booth and then the staff will issue the orders.
Good Shepherd Convent,"Here it is nice to buy condolences, just like the expensive ones. As for the picture taking, I recommend here instead of Mines View Deck!"
Good Shepherd Convent,Long line. The bag you will buy is out of stock. The hoard.
Good Shepherd Convent,Good Place to Buy tasteful Wrap UBE JAM🤩😋

Good Shepherd Convent,"Here is a home-made strawberry jam seller. The view is just as good as the Mines View, so I recommend coming here with a few people."

Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We started the trekking from butterfly farm and ended up exit via the horse stable which we think it’s not the exit. Lack of signboard is the issue.Overall the trekking was enjoyable with cool breeze. There should have been some shelters at checkpoint in case it rains. It rains when we were half way trekking, though we have umbrellas but it’s very chilling."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"My experience? Just had fun taking photos... I didn't knew there's dress code, I was in heels so I wasn't allowed to take any of the rides. The place is so nature, you could smell the pine trees' refreshing aroma. I definitely want to go back and try at least one of the rides! Recommend much!"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We had a nice experience at Tree top. Their staffs are very friendly and helpful. The rides are safe enough, we tried the Canopy ride and the Surfer slide which costs 400 pax for the both rides."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Had a lot of adventure activities to offer. But if your not that adventurous, the 300-meter trek is worth it especially at the end of the walk where the amazing view of Itogon mountains awaits.Must visit destination at Camp John Hay."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Wow what an expirence it was to visit this tree top adventure we had a blast here. There was cable cars/seats to travel along to an observation point a nice gentle ride. With very friendly staff and plenty of saftey equipment. Fast ziplines and trekking. Once you have been here an had an amzing time I recomend heading to the butterfly sanctury for a beautiful hike around the mountains so many breath taking views.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We did 'Trekking and Skywalk' and enjoyed the experience. The required hike was short and easy, and the view from the skywalk was breathtaking. The whole activity lasted us an hour.There is a briefing upon entering the place to inform visitors of the activities on offer and what those activities involve."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,It was the venue for my nephew's wedding and the first time I've been to this part of Baguio City.I'm one of the Filipino people who could be proud of this particular place for any party or get-together or any activity you name it. It's an adorable place which I've witnessed seeing it from top and looking down below I was amazed.I even dreamed of having the place for my party in future in God's will. Just take note of having a good caterer company to cater all your needs and up to your standard then everything will be perfect.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Highly recommended for families and friends bonding who loves adventurous and thrilling rides through ziplines with very beautiful view of tall and giant pine trees in Baguio.  Very good and well maintained facilities, and very courteous staff."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"This place is the best destination for all baguio visitors who are looking for adventure, thrill, excitement and fun.It has many rides supervised by professional and kind staffIt suites adults and kidsAlso it is located in Camp John Hay which is considered as the most popular picnic destination in baguio"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We came here as early as 9am and we've experienced riding the Canopy, Silver Surfer and Superman in priority! Haha We enjoyed the rides, especially the views! It's a nature trip with a twist! 😉👌 Plus, the Packages prices are so much affordable. Best to enjoy in groups (family or friends)."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"If you're up to adventure and adrenaline rush while in Baguio, this is the perfect spot for you. It was a great experience, we tried all of the activities and it's totally worth it! They offer Canopy Ride, Superman Ride, Trekking, Skywalk, Tree Drop and many more. They offer different packages for you to choose on, it's good for groups and couples. Staffs are friendly and accomodating and all activities have a complete safety gear. Also, they prohibit wearing sandals, slippers, shorts & sando. And aside from the activities fee, you'll also pay an Admission Fee for only P100. 👍👍👍"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"This place is wonderful. It shows you what happens when you take care of nature.This place's tree drop is very exciting but is also really safe. They have excellent staffs from the briefing area to the activities itself; they can precisely explain, hype up the activity and are friendly. But then I think that the real attraction here is the conservation of the forests.Photo attached below is the Skywalk where you can see the Itogon Mountains. The photo is nothing compared to the real view. It was breathtaking and can make you just stare for some moment.The canopy ride is for those who are not into extreme activities. It allows to view the forest from above.Overall the place is really worth visiting. The price for the activities is just right and is affordable. The staffs are accomodating. Excellent."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"The place is big, there are some activities to participate, such as zipline (superman ride),   cable car (canopy), silver surf,  tree drop, prices are sffordable, though there's an entrance fee of P100 for trekking. Good thing here, there's no fee of using their comfort rooms, unlke some attractions in Baguio."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,a very nice place to have a picnic here.. and its quiet cold as well even children will love to play.. thanks for letting us visit in here.. more power.. 🤗🤗🤗
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Awesome rides. We were oriented first and staffs are nice and very friendly! Surel coming back for new sets of adventure!!!
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Great fun for a thrill seeker like me though it is lacking that drag and force for adrenaline. maybe if you want more extreme zipline nearby Baguio try Pugad zipline in Pugo
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Very accessible. It's situated inside camp john hay so madaling hanapin. Mababait yung mga staff. Very professional. Yung mga ride operators were also polite and trained to ensure the guests' safety.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Are you an extreme adventurer? Then Tree Top Adventure is for you. You can enjoy extreme rides that you can imagine, there is the tree drop, where in you will fall 60 feet above the ground that will surely make you heart skip a beat. There is also the superman ride, where in you get to fly like superman and enjoy the view of the beautiful city of Baguio. There is also the silversurfer ride. And for those who are not into extreme rides, you may enjoy rides like the canopy and there is also the trekking and skywalk, in which you will really enjoy the cool breeze and the beauty of the city. There are a lot of activities that you can enjoy and in affordable price, Tree Top Adventure offers different packages for the rides that you chose to try. For me trying this kind of activity gives me a whole new experience that I can treasure. I must say it's a worth it activity."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,It was ok. Exciting activities but I think it is best suited for those who are really physically fit. Too many stairs and a lot of walking. Good for the health but tiring.The staff is accomodating and friendly.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Firstly, I believe their price is not so expensive. A must stop for families who want to have quality of time. Parking is enough and the staff are profesaional."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,If you need some adrenaline rush then this is for you. The place is near cemetry of negativism at bell house. There are packages you can choose from sliver surfer to canopy to superman zip line. Be ready though for a light trek as the attractions are a bit far especially the superman but its worth it. Going there is not that hard either take a taxi or drive there. For those who will opt for a taxi ride just note that is a bit hard to hail a taxi going back to the city center. The site is inside camp john hay.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"When I want to experience extreme in Baguio, only one place comes to mind. Combine fun, adventure, and maybe a touch of terror when you visit Tree Top Adventure in Camp John Hay, Baguio City. It’s definitely worth the experience. Something you will surely never forget.this is very challenging placeVery entertains many tree activityFrom drop tree,superman,silver surfer,canopy,sky walk ect"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,If you want adventure you must tree top adventure they offer affordable adventure staff is really accommodating and the place have nice view ♥️
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Great day out, superman ride was definitely my favourite out of the bunch of experiences on offer."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Always a great place to bring the kids in Baguio. There's a height and body build limit for the more adventurous rides
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Friendly staff. I think the only issue I have was that it's a bit pricey. But everything is good. Will recommend.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"They are nice but the ""AD VENTURE"" is overrated. I was expecting a zipline between the mountains hahaha it was meh"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Nice place to bring your whole family. Great for kids adventure and liesure time.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,The place was great. All activities were safe and secured. Highly recommended for thrill seekers.PS. Only tried Silver Surfer.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"if you're in for a not so ordinary type of experience then you must try these adventure/rides, surely you'll love it"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,A good place to relax and have fun especially during the less busy times of the month.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Your money won't be wasted, the activities was just light and not too extreme just for fun with kids and couples."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,One of the best attraction to have activity in baguio. Want to come here when i visit baguio again
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Tree top is a great place to spend with your family in Baguio. If you want slow or exhilarating rides you should come here. Rain or shine they're open. Palmera Sol was a great guide
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"To expensive, no adventure only marketing bla bla bla.....waist of time. However GREAT VIEW"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"I didnt take any rides while I was here so I can only say, meh."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Awesome views. Fun place. Located next to a Nice, big fun park for families."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Very serene place. Perfect for nature picturials.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,An adventurous way of appreciating the cold weather and green sceneries of Baguio City.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"If you are adventurous and visiting Baguio, this is definitly the place to be. Escaping the crowded, faul air filled city of Baguio, this adventure park offers a few exciting rides. The mission imbossible style drop is the best one in my opinion. The chairlift is way too slow but you can enjoy some nice views."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,I highly recommend this place if you want to refresh yourself.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Great experience, very nice and helpful  staff, don't miss the tree drop!"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Reasonably priced, fun little adventures high up in the trees. Each ride is fairly brief but exciting enough."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,So much fun and adventures. The most exciting and scariest to experience is the tree drop! But it was really great to fear your fears haha!
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Spectacular views and a good place to bond with your family and friends
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Get ready to be adventurous. Very safe for kids. Complete with safety harness and accomodating guides. Unforgettable.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,It was amazing. Nice views. Good and accommodating staff and very adventurous yet enjoyable rides..
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Went here last November 15, 2022Already closed."

Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Must try for families! Although there is a height limit for certain rides.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"If you're looking for a great place for team building activities, this is the best place for you."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Try superman and tree drop adventure. Im sure you will not regret
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Its very beautiful place                Cant wait to be back
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Great experience  for my tree drop adventure!
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"If you are looking for xtreme experience, tree top adventure is the place to be."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,This is a very unforgettable for me since it is my first time to do this kind of activities and I am with my girl! We had a blast at the Silver Surfer and the Superman! I have fear of heights and that makes it extra thrilling! Highly recommended!
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Best place for family outing,  cool breezy air specially December up to February months.A bit of traffic afternoon to night time.Plan your family and friends outing was unconditional experience, you can enjoy a quite moment and a swing tall trees."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"This tourist attraction, for me, is indeed a must-visit site for every Baguio goer! It has the perfect mix of relaxing and exhilarating rides or activities– the Canopy, Skywatch Tower, Superman, Silver Surfer and the Tree Drop. You will surely have an enjoying and memorable place! In addition, their staff is really welcoming and accommodating. Just prepare enough water to make you hydrated when you'll go trekking; it's going to be tiring, yet worthwhile."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Superman Ride is extreme yet fun. Adding the jolly staffs. 👍🏼
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Nice activities and view but for a steep price which will be consumed in a short period of time. Organized service and helpful personnel, safety is high priority. Dont come in shorts and sandos if you want to avail the rides, they are strict in attire. One comment is that you are not allowed to ride without a ticket so if you change your mind after the trecking you need to walk back to the starting point to purchase a ticket and walk back to the ride, so decide at the starting point at what you want to do or face this consequence of walking back and forth."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Super fun! What we did is to trek our way first to the farthest activity which is the superman instead of having the canopy first. There's a 100+ steps back up fromSuperman which should be fine since your next spot will be skywalk. You can relax from here with an amazing view. Our next stop was the silver surfer which should be done in pairs. If you're going solo, a staff will accompany you during the ride. We had 3-4 canopy rides back (sorry I lost count). There's up to 4 seats each ride. Our last activity was the tree drop. Short but will get your adrenaline pumped. It tooks us up to 2 hours for all the activities. There's minimal visitors when we came there so there's almost no waiting time on all activities. Staffs are super friendly. Value is great."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,anyone is not allowed to view the place inside. they will stop you on the entrance. Not a good place for sight seeing.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Beautiful experience ~ I went in 1978 after my husband died. I experienced the ""psychic healers"" it was awesome and wonderful. That experience started me on my intuitive/spiritual journey adventure. That was 37 yrs ago. I would love to go back. I stayed in Manila at The Bay View Plaza. I was there for 20 days. It was a beautiful experience ~"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"This is an exciting place to venture out on. There are a lot of activities one can do, and the best and most thrilling there is, is the Superman Ride. The view of the mountains and pine trees is exquisite and breathtaking. Trekking is fun, and the Canopy Ride is relaxing. This sure is a must-try. 10/10"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Our family and I had a great time at CJH's Tree Top Adventure. Super fun and all their staff are very accomodating and professional. Awesome customer service. We will definitely come back! Thank you for making our stay memorable. :)
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Should one be looking for some adrenaline-rush activities while being one with nature, THIS IS THE PLACE. With the cool climate of Baguio City and amazing overviews on top of the mountain where this tour spot is located, experience is one-of-a-kind.Be mindful of their business hours, though: 8AM to 5PM.Have FUN and HAPPY travelling!"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Staffs are very friendly and accommodating. The place itself just enough for a small group. The rides are safe to use. Mind to just bring small and compact stuff with you. And use selfie stick while taking picture.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,If you want some extreme adveture this is the place. There is so much things to do here. The zipline has a good height and the view was mesmerizing.The place offers a picture perfect scenes and it welcomes people who wants to have picnic.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"The place is huge and usually has long distances every station of your ride. You can do various activities like long zip line, silver surfer, canopy ride and many more. What made me tear down is 60 foot rapelling! Could you imagine that?! If you're with your family and they're not fit to do those, don't worry! They wouldn't feel out of place because the it offers skywalk and trekking. You would easily find this place since they are located inside Camp John Hay."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We went there on 29 Dec 2015 to do package 1, and we are about 30 minutes from our first ride. They suddenly cancelled their operation due to mechanical issue on the canopy ride. The good thing is they refunded all the costs."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Awesome activities for adrenaline junkies! There are activities too for those peeps that are not so adventurous. Staff are friendly and efficient. Safety of their clients is being double or triple check.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"I recommend Treetop Adventure Baguio to those people who want to see the scenery of Baguio in a different Angle. Especially from Skywalk, Canopy Ride, Superman Ride and Silver surfer because each ride offers different views.What I loved the most was the Superman Ride because I was mesmerized by the spectacular mountain scenery at the other side of the cable. I also loved the Treetop Adventure Drop because it got the hell out of me. (I rode all the activities)But if you want to keep low (not literally low because the activities are all done in heights), and you’re not a thrill-seeker, I recommend getting the Skywalk (Observation deck) and Canopy ride (you’re just sitting on a hanging chair moving from tower to tower).WARNINGS: If you are not fond of walking/trekking/long stairs-steps, please don’t even bother going, because activity areas are a bit far from each other. Make sure you have your water with you to stay dehydrated (you can buy water at the stall beside the cashier) because you can find no water in the activity areas; And don’t forget to wear comfortable rubber shoes too! I hope my review helps!"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"The good thing when you get here is the tour guides. After the entrance of tree top baguio, there will be some introductions/orientations for the travellers, for their safety. Then there you'll know the different kinds of rides that suits you."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,One of the best experiences ever! Waiting in line for the next ride kind of eats up all the time we have pero endured it and the experience was priceless. Hoping for less waiting time between rides in the near future. And also sana may souvenir shop where we can buy mementos of our experience with Tree Top Adventure.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Zip-lining amazing experience hahaha very affordable price
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Very exhilarating and relaxing at the same time. Awestrucking views. Cool air.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,100% safe. The staffs are very friendly and accommodating. You can see the beautiful view of baguio when you're on the ride.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,The Tree Top Adventure is a nice way to get out of the city and connect with nature. They have different packages to cater your thirst for a calm adventure. The pricey ones cover their whole area.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Very fun place with scenic views. I reccomend trying the ziplines (but not if you are afraid of heights!). One of the best destinations in Baguio. I strongly advise giving this place a try.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Beautiful and relaxing scenery, but what happened to all the 'aventure' ? Definitely not my kind of adventure, but if the place would be fixed up , it could be a very enjoyable experience. Trekking is the most enjoyable"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Amazing experience above the pine trees.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Place is nice get ready for the terrain
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Situated inside Camp John Hay. Operations depend on the weather. Since all activities are done outdoor and it was raining when we went here, the activity area was closed. We'll definitely go back to try this next time."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Treetop Adventure Baguio offer different attractions like the Skywalk, Canopy ride, and other zip line rides. We tried the Skywalk, it includes a short trek going to an elevated platform where you can stay as long as you want to experience a different view of the majestic mountain region of Baguio. Although the experience is great I found the fees very expensive."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"I would assume that this would be a great place to visit but because of the lack of information about dress codes, I wasn't able to go in. I overheard a few families' dismay about this as well. I suggest that the management should publicize rules and regulations about visiting this tourist spot."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Definitely for the thrill seeker! My son enjoyed it!
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Fun and enjoyable activities offered. Well organized and worth the price. It gives older kids something to look forward to when visiting Camp John Hay!

Tree Top Adventure Baguio,I loved the TREE DROP! Its a must try. It'll make your knees tremble. 😂😅😂Though the zipline is a bit disappointing. But its still a must if you wanted some adventure.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Trekking here is great! If you love to see pine trees, take dramatic pictures with the trees, then this is the place to go! Inhale the sweet smell of the pines."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Located at Camp John Hay. You can also see here the Butterfly Garden, Bell House, Secret Garden and the Amphitheatre. It is also a great place for picnic with family."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,The skywalk was really disappointing... It wasnt what we expected... We thought it was bigger and longer walk but its just a matter of 5 seconds walk... Briefing ang info was kinda deceiving...
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,You'll definitely love it! Superman ride is a personal favorite. The staff there is ftiendly.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,I'm a little disappointed. Cause I bought package No.2 and expected to have a lot of fun but I found out that's it's extremely short the entertainments and overpricedPs. But this place has a lot of potential hopefully they make it better

Stuffs were very accommodating and the environment is full of pine trees , you can go and walk around to enjoy the nature.At first, I was very afraid of the ride and was screaming really loud, my sister and the stuff was kinda smiling at me because of my enthusiast (haha - im scared really) but when the ride started and your  like on top going up and down, it was really fun."

Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Located in the mountains, a natural amusement park with a total of six facilities.At the beginning, there will be an explanation of the rides, then choose the activities you like, fill in the relevant information, and buy the ticket. The ticket can be bought separately or with a package. All activities are exciting but at the same time you can enjoy nature, a good place to try!"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,For a 75 pesos per person entrance this place is quite good. Good for picture taking. It's just hard to get up.There is a parking fee of 50 per car. Well secured the place and pets are allowed.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"If you are not afraid of high places, this is for you! 😍"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Good experience especially for children..Security 5/5Staff 5/5Place 5/5Try the tree drop, the feeling is delicious 😝😝😝"

Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"The atmosphere is cool, the food is delicious and cheap, the view is beautiful."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Unfortunately they have been closed since the pandemic but they have not updated Google. Too bad we made a trip there. Unfortunately it is permanently closed...
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Very cool and beautiful place but the time of the rain is closed play and there is a palace close to him wonderful cut ticket and enter his old mansion

Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"There are usually not many visitors in the park, so you can visit at your leisure. The staff is very kind and the service is very attentive, it is worth a visit."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,It is not something you pay to enter. An unmaintained facility. Equipment that remains broken and closed. Full of handmade feeling. The toilet is only at the entrance.

Valley of Colors,"A new tourist spot in Baguio. An instagramable place just along the high way going to La Trinidad. This spot will not take you about 5 minutes to complete your photoshoot. So when you are visiting this spot, you also try to visit nearby destination like the Bell Church which is just 3 minutes walk away."
Valley of Colors,The concept is actually great. What is remarkable is that this number of private houses agreed to be painted absent their choices of color in order to bring the best of this hill. This may symbolize that unity can achieve greatness. I did not realized such before because maybe this place is very familiar to me as I almost daily passing it by. The place is easily accessible thru La Trinidad Jeepneys. There is no specific parking place but you can park side of the highway.Hope they will repaint it again to bring back how it was once vibrant. The animated photo is not mine (CTTO).
Valley of Colors,"Honestly not worth it. The place has not been maintained. Crowded and there's really no room when several batches of tourist come at once since it's literally along the highway. However, I won't stop you if you really want to experience it. Camera filters are the key. 😉 …More"
Valley of Colors,"Good photo shots from afar, not nice up close. Crowded residential area painted creatively. If it weren't for the paint, it would be close to a city slum area on a hill. I think it needs improvement to be a safer & scenic tourist spot. The colorful houses have a 10 pesos donation at the space near the entrance that also sells goodies. You can take photos only up to the bridge. Don't go further in because it's a private residential area beyond the bridge.The view still does have a little charm of watching a movie's scene where poor people live. You can see some laundry hanging outside. The ambiance isn't relaxing. There's water under the bridge. The bridge can be shaky, so don't shake it while walking through it. And since it's a private residential area, there's quite a number of passerby and traffic along the bridge since it's not separated.If you just want photos, it's a quick stop. If they improve the traffic by making another bridge path for tourists, then maybe it'll be better. It's hard to take solo pictures while people pass through the bridge after all."
Valley of Colors,Colorful cute houses! The area is still closed but you can still go to the bridge area to take photos. We had this photo taken on our way to Banaue Rice Terraces.
Valley of Colors,Use as a setting for Erich Gonzales famous teleserye The Blood Sisters. Love the vibrancy of the valley!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - View📸📸📸📸📸 - Instagrammable😊😊😊😊😊 - Enjoyable
Valley of Colors,"If you would like to experience the cold breeze of the City of the Pines - Baguio City, don't miss to take time to travel and witness the colorful houses of La Trinidad, Benguet (Boundary of Baguio City and La Trinidad.It is just 20-30 minute jeepney ride.You should not miss this one! 😁"
Valley of Colors,Great art work! A must visit. More fun in the Philippines!
Valley of Colors,"You have to wait for your moment to get a perfect picture. Few mins walk to bell church. I just hope that the residents show their appreciation for having their place as an attraction- by removing their clothes hanging in their window, just sayin’🤷🏼‍♀️"
Valley of Colors,"It's nice, but if you don't stand directly on the foot bridge you capture everything else."
Valley of Colors,This place catches the eye of the passing motorists especially with new visitors. In the highway you will see a group of houses filled with different bright colors that makes you feel happy and invites you to take a photo on the hanging bridge connecting the houses to the highway.
Valley of Colors,"What a colorful display of homes built scarily on the side of a cliff!  They're beautiful to look at, but I wouldn't want to live there!  It's looks wayyyyyyyy too dangerous for my taste!  Especially for someone who is known to walk in their sleep!A large portion of one of my favorite Filipino tele series, ""Blood Sisters"", was filmed here in 2018. I can see why they chose this area to film.  The colors of the homes are so vibrant and the entire area is picturesque!   Pictures don't do it justice so, you're just going to have to visit here to see how beautiful it is in person.The Blood Sisters story centers around the lives of triplets, Erika, Agatha, and Carrie who were separated at birth.  The Valley of Colors is where one of the triplets, Agatha, grew up with the sisters' biological mother.  Triplet, Erika, was snatched as an infant and lived on the street until  she was taken in by a kind family.  Triplet, Carrie, was more fortunate and grew up with her biological father and his wife's wealthy family. It's a great tele series and I highly recommend watching it!Here are some pictures we took!"
Valley of Colors,"Just dropped by...looks good in the pictures. Had a hard time taking pictures since it was raining and there were a lot of other toursists and villagers in the bridge. Also, the creek (or body of water undre the bridge) somehow smells."
Valley of Colors,Mesmerizing color houses 😍❤️ love it ! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜    ♥️💗
Valley of Colors,"A beautiful place to visit and experience local interaction. Please be aware this isn't a tourist attract, these are peoples homes and deserve respect and care. Best to come outside of peak-times with a local to help explain the history and support the locals."
Valley of Colors,"It is good place to take photos, you will see a good view …More"
Valley of Colors,"The Favella of PH, the famous colors of StoBoSa.The people who assists visitors are polite and attentive. They strongly recommend to let the residents walk freely in the bridge to avoid hassles. Nonpayment needed just donate whatever amount you can.Since this is a residential area, the smell isn’t that good due to the creek but the view is still refreshing in the eyes.Long way to go from the city proper. You can ride the jeep for a cheaper expense or ride a taxi if you can afford the 200+php worth cab ride.Add on, Bell church is near to this area. Few steps going back will do ü"
Valley of Colors,"If you're into aesthetics, this is the place to be. However, if your goal is to explore more of La Trinidad, then maybe you could try looking for other places other than this. What you see in the picture is what you'll also see when you visit. It's by the roadside so it's accessible, but I dont recommend visiting here at noon time because it's too hot.That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Just a normal neighborhood that's good for the feed."
Valley of Colors,"Quiet & orderly. No over-crowding, not many new buildings except the improvement of existing houses since my last visit some 10 years ago. It means that the subdivision is managed well and that the original owners - government employees - are living within their means and are still true to the objective of the housing project."
Valley of Colors,"It's a good thing to realize they made an effort but could have maintained it. Due to pandemic, they have allocated specific location for you to take your photos."
Valley of Colors,"From Quezon Hill Baguio youll pass by Valley of Colors when you are bound to Strawberry Farm. Just beside the road, its difficult to park your car to take your pictures. This place is improving its just that the cables wires are obstructions to the view."
Valley of Colors,"Valley of colors is a good view when you pass through the road. When u step down here to see this, The bell church is also just near walking distance."
Valley of Colors,Looks good on photos but not in real life. Not worth visiting.
Valley of Colors,"Went to this place this morning but of course you dont have to expect the real thing you see on IG and Facebook. Here are the samples from today's trip Oct 24, 2018 7AM"
Valley of Colors,"📍Valley of Colors, La Trinidad, Benguet📌The idea to paint all the houses in different colors was taken from the Favela Paint Project in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, Brazil.📌DAVIES Paints provided 2,800 gallons of colored paints for free! 🙌📌18,000 sqm. or 150 houses where painted!"
Valley of Colors,This could be a side-trip during your La Trinidad or Baguio tour. Basically its a residential area of colored houses that became a sight to behold because its located on a mountainous area that is on the other side of a stream/river. Locals and its officials should maintain the upkeep or create a cafe/resto to add to its touristy vibe.
Valley of Colors,"Just log your name and you can take pictures freely. Try strawberry ice cream! Have patience, there are plenty of people."
Valley of Colors,The houses looked cute. …More
Valley of Colors,Good view and relaxing! …More
Valley of Colors,This is a great representation of how filipinos are creative!. A squammy place turned a valley of colors!. We just had a hard time getting a perfect spot for a solo pic due to a huge number of tourists.
Valley of Colors,It's a nice view. I like the idea of painting colors to the houses situated on that side of a hill. I am just bothered with the river at the bottom of the houses. It's reeking with a foul smell. I hope the LGU could do something about it.
Valley of Colors,Touch and goIdea works for low cost housing to look goodSewage is a sore eye in the river over the bridge
Valley of Colors,The colorful houses give a nice view on the highway. Be mindful of the parking though since this is on the highway itself. The view could also be better if there are no electrical lines but we're in the Philippines so I think it's normal. You could spend 10-15 minutes of your time here for photo ops then you could go to the bell church since it is very near.
Valley of Colors,"Valley of ColorsThe Valley of Colors is an artwork commissioned as part of a Government project for promotion of tourism. It is depicted in its lovely and colorful houses and buildings built in three similar localities on lush green mountains of Barangay Balili, in the outskirts of Baguio city in Phillipines. The houses are colored in an artistic way, locally known as the StoBoSa Hillside Homes Artwork. It is a community paintwork of multiple houses composed into single artwork designed by the Tam-Awan Village group. About 200 houses are involved in this project which started in 2016. The Valley of Colors is located near Bell Church, about 4 km from city center."
Valley of Colors,"Its vibrant color is truly captivating but beyond that it's still a village of ordinary yet artistic people. Just be mindful when visiting the area, not all the times would they want any tourist just walking in to their path and taking pictures, not that they are aggressive or anything but respect some spaces."
Valley of Colors,"Yes it's an artwork but no, I wouldn't stop to take a picture of painted houses with tarps and their laundry hanging. Probably ok if it was maintained well but as of Apr 2022, it's not as instagrammable as before."
Valley of Colors,Must see place!!! I was by worst weather here and not regred it. Amazing beautiful village !!
Valley of Colors,"It’s just a small section of a colorful residential area but a good sidetripif you’re going to the Strawberry Farm or to Mountain Province. There’s no decent parking lot, you have to Park at the side road at your own risk."
Valley of Colors,"Houses that are full of colors , for picture taking only. …More"
Valley of Colors,Its a good place for visit... but difficult to find a transportation to going back to baguio main city.. tips: if wanna go here and ur accommodation is far...  better ask the driver or taxi to do round trip....
Valley of Colors,"We always take this route each time we travel to Baguio from Mt. Prov. & back and this colorful hill is impossible to ignore but is best appreciated from afar than otherwise. As seen from the photo, the entangled electrical lines spoil the beauty of the scenery but it is what it is. :-)"
Valley of Colors,Good place for photo capturing only. The location is along the highway. The colorful houses are attraction to an ordinary highway in La Trinidad.
Valley of Colors,"Not quite as amazing as I had imagined but it is quite accesible if you are going to La Trinidad, Benguet as it is just on the roadside"
Valley of Colors,"Nothing to see here, just another overhyped tourist location."
Valley of Colors,"No entrance, donation only"
Valley of Colors,"The view point is along busy hiway. No parking area. It is election time, expect many tarpulins everywhere. But still a good place to visit in Baguio."
Valley of Colors,I recommend you to go up on the hill to see the cityscape because it's so beautiful!!
Valley of Colors,"You can take Jeepney here at Jeepney Terminal 8.5peso, just some colored houses, staying for 20 minutes, the roadside traffic is very crowded, the stairs are steep, pay attention to safety"
Valley of Colors,Fun to see but not much to do besides take a few pictures. Make sure you have other things planned for the day!
Valley of Colors,Cooperation of the local community is as vivid as the colors of the village which attracts tourists. 😉👌
Valley of Colors,It's an Expectation vs Reality  experience . Pictures of the place are  good but in reality it's not that colorful anymore. Paints have faded overtime.
Valley of Colors,It is beside the road and a residential area. These are houses with different colors and has a design/artwork that can be viewed from afar.
Valley of Colors,Valley of Colors is 💓 try and go here its was amazing where you can see the art of the every house 😊
Valley of Colors,"picture see good, but actual no, just some old house"
Valley of Colors,"If you are going to Bell's Church, then you may also do a quick visit here at the Volley of Colors  just a 3 minute walk from Bell's Church."
Valley of Colors,Colorfull & unique …More
Valley of Colors,Maybe the place is a seasonal tourist attraction.
Valley of Colors,So nice
Valley of Colors,It's cool. You can take better shots if you have a drone or other equipment to widen the view since you will be on the roadside and the road is quite narrow while a lot of vehicles are passing. But it's a good experience all in all.
Valley of Colors,"So beautiful very Instagram worthy. There is a check-in table of sorts. With an ""admission donation"". Please don't skip that step it was only like P50 but it helps the area. You're free to walk on the hanging bridge as well. Perfect place for photos. But remember this is also peoples homes; so pay attention as residents use the bridge to get to and from their homes; so be respectful."
Valley of Colors,Amazed by the houses on the cliff 😮
Valley of Colors,A good source of revenue for the community but tourists can sometimes cause inconvenience for the locals (blocking access to the hanging bridge).
Valley of Colors,It was just fine. Website photos are very nice compare in actual.
Valley of Colors,Tourist spot in Baguio! …More
Valley of Colors,Its funny that its a tourist attraction but when we're there many clothes were hanging on the houses and we dont like to take a pic with so much clothes on the back ground. And when we're there the paint of the houses was old. I suggest they should put an announcement when was the best month to visit it. Just sayin.
Valley of Colors,"Love this place, especially yung natives. Don't forget to buy their famous strawberry ice cream!"
Valley of Colors,Very different in personGets a lil bit crowded because of tourist and locals passing by the small bridge.
Valley of Colors,Nice colored houses on the hillside at the entrance of La Trinidad. Typically a place for photo op. The local management requires free registration. Not much to see or do other than take photos on the official spot for tourists or on the bridge. Still Instagram-worthy
Valley of Colors,"It is a nice spot for a photo. Good thing that you cant capture the smell. If you plan to go here, might as well go to strawberry farm after. Since, you already braved the traffic on seeing this place. Several more and you'll be at the strawberry farm."
Valley of Colors,Good place to take pictures but the river below reeks with an awful smell.
Valley of Colors,"The effort to beautify the village with color, whether part of a local government project or a paint company, is a good one.The vibe is more South American, and you'll feel you're more in Peru than the Philippines.There is a little viewing area and of course a bridge over a stream. Most tourists (I was the only foreigner there) stay down below and take pictures. As long as it's not too hot and you're in decent shape, I recommend crossing the bridge and hiking all the way up through the neighborhood. It'll take at least 15 minutes, but you can do it at your own pace, and the view is nice from the top.Sewage and overall cleanliness seems to be an issue here, based on the pervasive stench. I believe there was a sign at the entrance warning of carcinogenic matter in the area."
Valley of Colors,"When I went here last 2016 and 2017, I wasn't able to see the transformation of this vast community in a mountainside. How sad.But more of the artistic side, we should be aware of the effects of deforestation happening in this side of Baguio and La Trinidad, as well as the other communities and encampments.I am more concerned on how will they endure massive earthquakes just like what happened in 1991. I hope that NDRRMC and the LGU of their cities comprehensively train its residents on their disaster mitigation and preparation efforts to keep the casualties at minimal cost. Furthermore, the houses built here have apparently varied foundation and that implies unstable shallow grounds that holds the weight of the houses here. it's as if they have carpeted the mountainside with concrete to hold much stability during the rainy season, but it contradicts on what may happen in the future."
Valley of Colors,They should start repainting the houses as it doesn't look good anymore. I dont know why are they allowing these hard headed tourists to park on the side of the road occupying half of the space where people can't walk on the side street making it unsafe to everyone.
Valley of Colors,"As of Jan 3, some of the houses are under renovation so some colors are lacking.However you can still get the view from a different angle. I suggest go there by noon so the sun hits the houses correctly for morning sun makes them cast a shadow."
Valley of Colors,A colorful place that illustrate the artistic minds of Filipinos.
Valley of Colors,I am not impressed to be honest. This is just like a one small street with colorful houses.
Valley of Colors,"After so much poverty and ragged, rugged housing this place is a joy to behold. There's nothing to do as such except admire the view but it's worth seeing. Very close to the Bell Church."
Valley of Colors,Take a stroll here and see this colorful place.
Valley of Colors,"Its nothing like you'd expect. Specially after looking thru photos from bloggers. Right now (Nov 2018) it doesn't look good. Colors are faiding, the bridge is dwindling and there are at least 2 houses either not completely built or out of concept directly across the bridge where you'd be expecting to take pictures. Still, its right after Bell Church. Taking 10 min off of your travel is still worth taking the pictures for."
Valley of Colors,Instagram worthy along the highway. ❤️
Valley of Colors,IMO it was just a combination of cramped up buildings in different colors on the valley. They may be settlers who made their inhabitat colorful. It would have been better if your see the colors of true nature.
Valley of Colors,"NO entrance fee needed. You just have to fill out details needed in a log book (which of course provided by the residents). You have an option to give donation, they will not force you. We're only allowed in the bridge to pay respect and give privacy to the house owners."
Valley of Colors,Looking at those houses makes my days stress-free!! Love it!
Valley of Colors,"Wasnt expected to be, should hide clothes hanging ruins the view, and some houses still has no color, sa Indonesia ata ginaya nila, may colored houses din, poor imitation plus walang masilungan sa init and rain to enjoy veiw"
Valley of Colors,colorful houses and nice place to take a photos
Valley of Colors,Great …More
Valley of Colors,Nice place but the clodes hangin to all windows is not good
Valley of Colors,Unique and Colorful Houses. Needs more improvement pa po.😊
Valley of Colors,Good to visit at dawn in time with the rising of the sun.
Valley of Colors,"Nice view, beautiful colours!! NOTE if you are traveling from Bagiuo take a TAXI!! Google maps say it's about 45 minutes travel hence why we got on a jeep going to La Trinidad.. turns out it's only like 15 minutes away from SM Mall in Bagiuo. We (3 of us) paid 85 peso each on the Jeep to get there. That's so expensive .. on the way back we got a Taxi and it cost 80peso for all of us! Jeep and Tricey drivers will try to ripp foreigners off any chance they get!!"
Valley of Colors,Awesome view
Valley of Colors,Very astonishing place in the Planet. The place my Lovely Daughter Lived together with her Awesome Mom nd Loving Grandmother.
Valley of Colors,Beautiful and unique artwork which is really appealing  to the eye. You can pass by this area which is just beside the road on your way to La Trinidad Strawberry Farm.
Valley of Colors,"other than the exterior, there is nothing much. i do hope the govt could turn this place into a hipster outlet with cafes and local tours and perhaps setting up a place selling local food in there. it will also help the locals in their likelihood"
Valley of Colors,"Its a sight to behold if you are passing by the high way of la trinidad going to baguio city and vice versa. However, youll have to park at your own risk in the road if you want ro take a closer picture of the place."
Valley of Colors,"The Valley of Colors is an Amazing sight. Going there is as easy as 1-2-3. If you're in Baguio City. Just go to the Jeepney Stations near slaughterhouse, then ride the jeep with a fare of 8.50 pesos. You can ride a jeepney going to La Trinidad. BENGUET. Just tell the driver to drop you to the valley."
Valley of Colors,"It is Colorful indeed, at least in my camera😅"
Valley of Colors,A must to visit. No entrance fee just a donation box. Its up to you if u will give or not.  nice coordinators. Very accommodating. 😊😊
Valley of Colors,Instagramable place.
Valley of Colors,It's great eye candy. You would really love to look at it but sadly it creates traffic jam and it's houses so there's no space for tourists to be honest.
Valley of Colors,I'd say it's more beautiful in the pictures😂 Hahahaha!
Valley of Colors,It is a good view if you are going to the strawberry farm. No parking space and you will need the right timing to get a good photo of this place.
Valley of Colors,This place is also good and interesting.
Valley of Colors,"Colorful,  although it needs renewal."
Valley of Colors,Old and overrated. You just need 5mins to spend at this place
Valley of Colors,Looking at the picture pang picture perfect!!!Tourist attraction talaga
Valley of Colors,"It's as if you are in Cape Town, SA. This place is locally known as StoBoSa, representing the three Sitios in the Barangay. Painted by Tam-Awan Village Artist volunteers"
Valley of Colors,Beautiful but you need a lot of patience because many people taking pictures and sometimes you need to wait for your turn.
Valley of Colors,Nice place but not much accessible to get a great view of the whole area for good picture not much of parking space too cuz its along the highway
Valley of Colors,"The idea was very awesome and good but, it looks trashy when ur the road in km3,, needs to go up to see the good picture"
Valley of Colors,They should maintain the place and fix all electric cable dangling all over the place so it will be good for picture taking
Valley of Colors,"STOBOSAValley of Colors is reffered to the whole Municipality of La Trinidad. It's the theme used during the 2013 STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL.The Colors of STOBOSA reffers to the colorful houses located at Km. 3 La Trinidad, Benguet.STOBOSA  stands for the three sitios of Barangay Balili, La Trinidad Benguet, namely STOnehill, Botiwtiw, and SAdjap.This giant mural was done through the collaboration of government and non government agencies, the community of STOBOSA and volunteers from different sectors of society. The paints used was donated by a paint company. The painting was done by the community and volunteers. The concept was done by the local artists of Baguio and Benguet. It was done through donation, cooperation, volunteerism and involvement of the local government of La Trinidad Benguet and DOT-CAR..."
Valley of Colors,Colorful only when you set your camera settings to Vivid .. nice place to stop by when heading to Strawberry Farm in La Trinidad
Valley of Colors,😍  💖
Valley of Colors,it's a cluster of apartments and houses with diffetent colors
Valley of Colors,Too dirty. Nothing really special.
Valley of Colors,"This is a poor excuse for an ""attraction"". There is nothing special about it. You're better off exploring other sights in La Trinidad."
Valley of Colors,Astonishing work of art.
Valley of Colors,"It was nice. Colorful. Not much to see, really. I was told there is a pattern when viewed at a certain angle but I did not saw it."
Valley of Colors,It was okay. It was not as vibrant as I was expecting though. The view deck should also be renovated or improved.
Valley of Colors,Been passing this for more than a year and still great to see tourist taking pictures. I even saw TheJuicyRoad bloggers take videos and pictures of it.  😀
Valley of Colors,Worth a look.  It's very impressive.
Valley of Colors,hmmm.. free entrance
Valley of Colors,I'd love to make it 5 stars but like the full beauty of it is only seen on a specific angle and location to see it properly
Valley of Colors,Great to take pictures.
Valley of Colors,"The place is great and all, but the people that lives in the area, seems like they're not keeping the place clean."
Valley of Colors,Baguio Trademark 🍓
Valley of Colors,"The main colour to be seen ( & enjoyed ) is   ,  , green 📳♻📳. The green herb ,Hemp can be viewed & smoked at this hippey location"
Valley of Colors,It's about 20-30mins aways from Baguio city depending on the traffic. The structured are not fully done so don't expect to much.
Valley of Colors,Nice colour
Valley of Colors,"Access is free, an overall solemn and nice place! Great for photo ops!"
Valley of Colors,Still a quiet interesting place but no big parking space cause its near the main road.
Valley of Colors,What an absolutely beautiful place and great way to turn a dark neighborhood into something colorful and cheerful.
Valley of Colors,Beautifully Structured
Valley of Colors,A great view with a scaring bridge
Valley of Colors,"A nice place to go to take pictures, but thats it. You have nothing else to do here."

Valley of Colors,I think it's okay. Color painted houses. It's nice to look at.
Valley of Colors,Colorful and amazing...and yet cleanliness need to be preserved down the canal..
Valley of Colors,"This was good before but now, the view is deformed by the clothes hanging from the houses. Eyesores."
Valley of Colors,very colorful buildings
Valley of Colors,The spot is too close to have a good backdrop of the different colored houses.
Valley of Colors,"Do not be fooled, THIS PLACE IS NOT A TOURIST SPOT. it's just a Sitio/Small Community with colourful houses."
Valley of Colors,It's on a bunch of house painted with diff colors. Not really for tourist though.
Valley of Colors,Nice view
Valley of Colors,"Amazing place, every one should stay here a while."
Valley of Colors,Good place to take picture but the cable is so distracting.
Valley of Colors,You can see the different colors of many houses on top of the mountain.
Valley of Colors,"The colors of La Trinidad, Benguet."
Valley of Colors,"Not much to do aside of taking pictures, also falls short compared to the original."
Valley of Colors,Beautiful but nothing to do here withaw taking photo

Valley of Colors,Naaah... nothing to see here really
Valley of Colors,"Very colorful and interesting place, great to visit"
Valley of Colors,"Beautiful houses, repaint with more vibrant colors."
Valley of Colors,Now CLOSED wants for payment and villagers unfriendly and not welcoming
Valley of Colors,The government should expand the place rather than just a plain instagramable place.
Valley of Colors,Very nice and colorful houses of la trinidad Benguet
Valley of Colors,Nice.. been there many times..
Valley of Colors,if there would be shades and sitting are it would have been perfect

Valley of Colors,Nice place
Valley of Colors,"Deliberately made artificial attractions, the color is not good-looking. It is recommended to come early and leave early, unless you take a jeepney, the taxi is too difficult to call."
Valley of Colors,"It's ok, especially when it was newly painted.. I hope they paint it again because it's one of the tourist spots."
Valley of Colors,"We just passed by, I'm not that amused either haha. but ok too"
Valley of Colors,"This is a beautiful place in Bagiuo in the Philippines, it is attractive by the many colors of the houses that follow each other with the same message, creating a sense of excitement for visitors when coming here, the houses are built by people. built on the side of a long area down to the abyss, it is not luxurious but has a strange architecture, there is a way to enter the residential area by a begging bridge, there is also a path leading to this area, which feels a bit strange. But it's a shortcut, not a nine, so if you've been to Baguio, you must definitely visit this once, a very unique thing of the Philippines."
Valley of Colors,"The small painted village is not bad to take a photo. You can visit the strawberry farm together, take a grab taxi or a jeepney to arrive."
Valley of Colors,"It's a small scenic spot, and it's over after a few minutes of taking pictures."
Valley of Colors,The people are very kind and it's free to take pictures. You can donate but it is not compulsory.
Valley of Colors,This coming December is right at the time when Da Ye Quy is blooming so beautifully!
Valley of Colors,"It is a place with beautiful scenery.If you go up to the top of the stairs, there is a more beautiful view.The stairs are steep and a little difficultWear comfortable shoes"
Valley of Colors,"It is very suitable for taking pictures of punching cards, but unfortunately, the buildings on the bridges have been photographed recently and they are more beautiful!"
Valley of Colors,The non-commercialized Taiwan version of Jiufen and the Busan version of Gamcheon-dong
Valley of Colors,It's OK. The artwork is nice. Just along the road.

Valley of Colors,"Billionaires Cafe in La Trinidad, Benguet"
Valley of Colors,"Nice place, you just have to wait for like 30-40mins. it depends because those before you often take time to take pictures."
Valley of Colors,"Pretty ......... Hmmmmmm. I don't know, it's just my 1st time there. Haha. Just colorful. That's all"
Valley of Colors,"It is not only the color that is distinctive, but also that they are layered on the hillside. Like the stack of Lego, it can be seen that their foundation should be stable."
Valley of Colors,It's not even good. Eye pain.
Valley of Colors,"just in the picture it's beautiful, but the place is not beautiful because it stinks"
Valley of Colors,"It's a small villageGreat place to take picturesThere are not many people, but you have to take a jeep to get there"
Valley of Colors,It would be nice if there were more campaign posters.
Valley of Colors,It's hard to take a picture on the bridge. Hahaha
Valley of Colors,The place is nice but the wirings hanging down make the view ugly.I hope there will be an improvement. 💙💙💙

Teacher's Camp,"I love the room so homey and simple but  clean. Beddings super clean also . There is hot and cold  shower. Near of everything resto and restobar convenient store, accessible tp public transpo. Most of all i love the view. We had coffee on the bench while bracing the morning dew and the beautiful sunrise. Difinitely we will go back again."
Teacher's Camp,It has been a nice place to stay when in Baguio. It’s cheap rates and discounts for government employees are great. Staffs are kind too
Teacher's Camp,"Beautiful place. Conducive learning environment. The weather is cold, a lot of corner and instagrammable spots."
Teacher's Camp,"Stayed here during our 9th PTYC. I enjoyed the view of towering pine trees and relaxing environment, it was a memorable experience."
Teacher's Camp,"I just love the place. Cheap but nice place to stay, esp when youre having vacation  with your family. We stayed in  1 of the guest houses furnished with with sala set, dinning set, refrigerator, kitchen where you can cook if you wish too."
Teacher's Camp,Really had a nice stay here in Baguio for the CMLI Annual Convention. The building we were staying in was newly renovated and secured with CCTV cameras. The rooms were also clean and very spacious. Their bathrooms are one of the most comfortable and clean bathrooms I've seen. This Camp is very big and you can stroll around the place. Very beautiful view and cheap souvenir items.
Teacher's Camp,Super Enjoy!!!! from Bestlink college of the Philippines
Teacher's Camp,"I went here to visit their gardens. Beautiful rows of flowers. Very picturesque. I congratulated the lady gardener and said thank you for what she grows. She gave me a big smile, I know she's proud of her work"
Teacher's Camp,Refreshing air and nature it's good and cold 😂😂 we stay for 2 night and it's very freezing ...
Teacher's Camp,"The place to stay in Baguio for travellers on a budget. They offer rooms mostly with common toilets and baths with hot water. They charge per person and provide toiletries. Friendly caretakers and guards. Facilities need upgrades and improvements, esp. the conference halls and rooms. Many pine trees and cool air but expect air pollution as many vehicles pass through the main road. Discounts for government workers."
Teacher's Camp,"A must go place if you are going to spend time at Baguio. The environment is well-maintained. However, the cottages could be a little more better if they will make some maintenance work especially on the comfort room but it's still manageable and their rent is more affordable. There are also strawberry taho vendors roaming around the area in the morning which is very nice to eat some taho while enjoying the nice view of the pine trees."
Teacher's Camp,"If you're looking for a budget room and are not particular in room amenities, this is the place for you. Rooms are presentable at best, they have working heaters though cr is shared (like in dormintories). Awesome view and accomodating staff."
Teacher's Camp,Been here for the second time and don't feel anything strange though. There were a lot of students when we came so it could be one factor why it isn't suspenseful as there were a lot of people around. But checkout my second photo below 👇👇👇. Not sure how to explain the photo I caught in the window on the second floor. All of these photos are real. It's up to you now how you will absorb it.
Teacher's Camp,"A nice place to recharge and unwind. A good place for families and friends. As of this month, November 2019, they increased rates for cottages but still affordable. They also have toiletries now 😊🏆"
Teacher's Camp,The venue has been improved but the food does not match needs of the attendees.
Teacher's Camp,Beautiful landscape of pine trees. Great for teachers who want to stay in the camp because they have a discount rate. Wonderful place to stay in their cottages with your family.
Teacher's Camp,Very good staff and amenities. God for budget friendly folks of Baguio. Lots of parking din.
Teacher's Camp,Another place to visit when in Baguio city.Quite famous for being one of the most haunted places in the Philippines
Teacher's Camp,"Good place to take a walk,i just hope the oval would be available soon🤙"
Teacher's Camp,Nostalgic. Love the place. The drainage smells really bad.
Teacher's Camp,Most buildings have been renovated and are in good condition unlike before. Never miss their souvenir shop since they sell goods for a cheaper price. Most things in Baguio are very affordable.
Teacher's Camp,"The units we have used in the past have greatly improved since our last visit in 2018. However, may I suggest that regular repairs and maintenance be programed so that minor defects are corrected early enough and  thus save money. Moreover, if budget allows, screen windows are highly recommended to minimize mosquito bites on guests esp on the children. Praying the above suggestions are viewed as coming from a concerned taxpayer. Thank you."
Teacher's Camp,"so relaxing and the employees, caretakers, guards are very accommodating"
Teacher's Camp,I personally like the place. Too bad we can't wait till 2pm to be able to check in since we arrived at 4am. The staff there didn't shove us away and was kind enough let us stay for quick naps.
Teacher's Camp,"The place is perfect and suitable for training, conferences and the like. It's very accessible. Love the structures there especially the admin building."
Teacher's Camp,Affordable and relaxing place to stay in Baguio.We chose the dormitory type room.
Teacher's Camp,The cost is cheap. It's a nice place for seminars especially for big crowd. Can handle 800+ delegates
Teacher's Camp,"Guest room 4 c,d and e are good locations.Very accessible to the main road and just a walking distance to some of the food stores around the area."
Teacher's Camp,Where here to attend the seminar :)
Teacher's Camp,This is a good place for large gatherings. Rooms are inexpensive compared to others.
Teacher's Camp,Very nice place to stay. I love the ambiance.
Teacher's Camp,Nice place to be with nature and spend your vacation... Verry accomodating...
Teacher's Camp,"We rented a whole house, fully furnished where you can cook your food, with hot shower."
Teacher's Camp,"Nice place with very hospitable staffs. Mukhang creepy pero wala naman talagang mumu. In fact, i slept alone at our room when all my roommates went out to chill. Pang instagram yung place & i love it!"
Teacher's Camp,"Serene, fresh air, feels like you're in  farm that is mountainous"
Teacher's Camp,"Home away from home! I love our guesthouse, it has everything we need for meals and coffee!"
Teacher's Camp,Place is quite old but still works very well. Parking is also not a problem which is very good. Provides very good accommodation to guests!
Teacher's Camp,Not crowded. Lots of open space.
Teacher's Camp,Some staff are not approachable when i went to make reservations but others are nice though..i do understand that maybe she was tired when I went to talked with her. the facilities looks nice.. the buildings are newly renovated that makes it so vibrant and beautiful. The cottages are nice too.
Teacher's Camp,Very very affordable place. Nice and cozy. Kakatakot lang ng konti. Hahah
Teacher's Camp,"If you are equipped for outdoorsy- adventure-stay then this is the place...cabin type houses and dorms. Although be prepared there are no indoor heating. There's hot and cold shower. If you chose to stay in dorms there are no electrical outlets inside rooms, all located outside halls. Decent bedding and linens. Cabin/guest houses are more suited for families."
Teacher's Camp,Nice place lots of flowers
Teacher's Camp,Do you like history? Do you like nature? Or do like paranormal? You can have it all at Teachers Camp! Teachers Camp mainly offers its vibrant surrounding and very accommodating halls and cottages for those who would like to held their seminars or just want to stay there. It is also very accessible for tourists since it is just minutes away from the central business district.
Teacher's Camp,"Good place. Yet, needs maintenance to be more presentable, convenient & competitive..."
Teacher's Camp,They offer low cost accommodation. Not too many amenities so do not expect a hotel treatment. But if you are looking for affordable accommodation surrounded by pine trees this is the place to be. Some say that some cottages are haunted
Teacher's Camp,"The cottages need renovation and should be maintained properly. Cats & dogs roam around the vicinity and if you fail to close the windows with broken screen, the cats will enter your cottage and share with your meals. Water heater in the cottage where we stayed is not working. It could have been a nice place to stay only if well maintained."
Teacher's Camp,"Wide awesome place to just spend your day and enjoy a nice jog or walk. This place is mostly used for workshops and seminars. The thing is, the stuffs sold here are a bit expensive so you might want to buy outside, maybe buy if it's only a must."
Teacher's Camp,"Very affordable with a very baguio ambiance. If you're the type who runs but can't go out running since you're not familiar with the city, there's a track and field area within the premises. Some of the popular night spots and restaurants are also located just across the street. Unfortunately, it is also a very popular place for seminars so they're almost always full. So better make a booking early."
Teacher's Camp,Want to breathe fresh air and want to jog in a quiet place? Here's Teacher's Camp. 😊
Teacher's Camp,"The management should improve their service. You have to go to your room far from the admin bldg without any guides. No signages. When you check out, you have to walk again to the admin bldg. carrying your heavy bags.The place is nice,relaxing and full of nature,but the admin and staffs should have more hospitality training.Except our caretaker,the only staff who greets the guests."
Teacher's Camp,Guest house 3 reminds me of our old house. I hope it gets updated though.
Teacher's Camp,Nice and very clean.. Marami security guards
Teacher's Camp,"my first morning here is so great!.., the first i tasted their strawberry taho"
Teacher's Camp,Nice place. Love it!
Teacher's Camp,"A nice, simple place in Baguio"
Teacher's Camp,Very accommodating and welcoming. The food was amazing and the place was cozy. It also was very accessible and many shops inside where you can buy most of the Baguio souvenirs and delicacies.
Teacher's Camp,Reminds me of my childhood adventures at Baguio.
Teacher's Camp,"The place is peaceful and suitable for group activities like seminars, teambuilding conventions and similar undertakings. It is clean and has perfect environment conducive for relaxation  ."
Teacher's Camp,I went for triage due to Covid-19 here. The people were very friendly and understanding of what I went through. They assisted me as best as they could on my process to enter Baguio City.
Teacher's Camp,Very peaceful place. Its a great area to do some jogging or other outdoor activities. But no restaurants though. So youre gonna have to bring your own food.
Teacher's Camp,Fun!! may be because of the enjoyable activities and team building that we do there prepared by our leaders during YSA conference. They say that the next conference will held there again. It's a nice place. 🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓
Teacher's Camp,One of the classic sites in the city that still has a lot of pine trees around. Old but functional structures that reflect the look of the old Baguio City are still around. Hope DepEd will find ways to preserve this historical place.
Teacher's Camp,"I love the places and we really enjoy our stay here from June 21 to 24, 2021"
Teacher's Camp,"Although renovations are on going, i wish the management would put more effort in maintaining the area. It's one of the iconic places in Baguio and it deserves more care and attention."
Teacher's Camp,"They said..pag gusto mo mag ghost haunting,the best place to go is yung white house sa baguio.well,i say..hindi lang dun may multo.teachers camp is one of the oldest camp na pwede ka rin makapag ghost haunting.we had this one experience nung 90's when our group went to baguio and stay in one of the cottages or bunk houses of the the camp.and super creepy talaga when we had that experience at 3am.its a long story but all of us ended up packing up our bags and check out 5am in the morning.still,the place is quiet and nice kapag sa umaga and afternoon.u can jog and relax kasi ang sarap ng weather.you can bring foods and enjoy the calmness of the sorroundings kapag gusto mo mag pa ka alone.😂.so overall 5 star for them."
Teacher's Camp,Mura lang but scary ambiance. If you are in a budget  this is a place to go. For 200php to 300php a night that would be neat. Just don't choose the quirino hall it's freaky.
Teacher's Camp,I had attended an International Seminar last week in here. There are different halls to hold different conferences.  There are dormitories too. A mess hall is also available where participants can be served food.
Teacher's Camp,Rich history. Glad this is preserved. :)
Teacher's Camp,"There are adequate securities manning the entrances and several buildings. However, additional lightings (street lamps etc.) are needed within the camp to further security measures."
Teacher's Camp,"A good place to stay. In addition to that they have free toiletries, friendly personnel and great ambiance."
Teacher's Camp,The location is lovely but the place especially the cottages and its other amenities need to be restored;the facilities need to be upgraded.
Teacher's Camp,"The price is less expensive plus if you are looking for a thrill (had a spooky experience), this is a place you can stay!"
Teacher's Camp,Nice and comfortable place 😊I can see the whole place😊We conduct here a seminar for 3 daysAnd its nice to stay here for a bit while.. 😁
Teacher's Camp,"What's good: affordable accomodations, good food, big convention halls. What needs improvement: all sleeping quarters need renovation/upgrading."
Teacher's Camp,"Great for pictorials, training seminars, and perfect if you want a peaceful, environment friendly place.Many trees and flowers sorrounding the place."
Teacher's Camp,Most of the rooms has no heater. But the bed is quite comfy
Teacher's Camp,Convienient and affordable when it comes to budget. The rooms are clean and nice yet in small space.
Teacher's Camp,Served as a Triage for OFWs. Very accommodating quarantine staff. Kudos!

Teacher's Camp,"The place was a camp for American teachers known as the 'Thomasites' at the turn of the 19th century during the American occupation.This historical spot is now famous for seminars, sports events and tourist transients."

Teacher's Camp,"Wala naman ghost. :) perfect for relaxing and bonding tama lang na walang wifi, may heater,"
