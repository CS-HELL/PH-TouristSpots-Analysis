Wright Park,"‚Ç±250/30minutes to ride a horse with a guide is not bad at all. The kids loved it. The guide was courteous, Kuya Rolly. The stroll around The Mansion and the mirror pool was my fave. The area had bike lanes and the paid restroom area had a landscaped zen like garden and was so clean. The whole area was clean and the lark was well kept. The pool had fishes on it. A few meters walk down towards botanical was a steak place you can wind down on, they have . Pine Country Steaks and Waffles! Highly recommended!"
Wright Park,Never fails to be mesmerizing. It's my 5th time to be here and I still enjoy going here. Nice to help local tourist spot and help boost their economy. Specially the ones that are striving to for it. If you love nature come here. But make sure it's the weekdays because weekends produce the most populous days to travel.
Wright Park,Part of Wright Park is under renovation. Love the view of many horses big and small. Also appreciate the efforts and presence of vendors around the park for more convenient tour. A thirty minute horseback riding is worth P300.
Wright Park,"When I was 8 yrs old we went to Baguio for a trip with my family. I wanted my child to have the same experiences and memories. Wright Park had more flowers more than 20 yrs ago. It was more beautiful. Now, even the trees are sparse and the water looks like its extremely murky. Nonetheless, I hope my boy holds these memories as precious as I hold my memories of Baguio when I was young."
Wright Park,"It is less crowded during the pandemic so we get to enjoy the park more.Great place to pass time, unwind and just to enjoy the beautiful scenery."
Wright Park,"This is where people visit for a horseback riding. As expected, there are many horses available but most of them seem unwell so we didn't tried to ride one. We just let the kid to experience it. They offer photo op with the horse and you just have to pay 50 pesos. The smell is quite not nice but understandable."
Wright Park,Nostalgic. Wright park is divided into 2. Upper and lower. The lower part is the horse backriding. The ride is 250/ 30minutes. I recommend camp john Hay if you want to horse backride because the space is limitedThe upper part is great. It is just across the Mansion. Make sure to take a photo at the long pond/reflection
Wright Park,"Ig worthy place. The fishes are cute, they all stop moving for a while. It's nice to take pictures here and also just a very refreshing place to explore. Bring a thicker mask or handkerchief because it stinks in the horse-riding area."
Wright Park,Kids enjoyed riding a horse around the city. P500/ head. Plus tip to your kuya tour guide. üòâ
Wright Park,My kids enjoyed their time on top of their horses. We were the only one's in the park and we loves it.
Wright Park,"Just right.. for we need to cool up, we're family from Alaminos City Pangasinan.. hot place always and it is indeed a good chance to visit Baguio City üíñüíñüéâ"
Wright Park,"You can ride horses and see beautiful horses. Beside from that the ambiance is no goods, the trees and plants are refreshing. There‚Äôs not much to do"
Wright Park,"So nice to walk en the surrounding so refreshing and nice to my eyes en the weather too I want to back again ,the only one I say is thank God for the wonderful place He create for us"
Wright Park,The horse riding is a good experience for kids. Family oriented venue. Requires active physical activities.
Wright Park,The park is exceptionally serene and beautiful during non-peak hours. The amenities and gardens here are also dutifully maintained.
Wright Park,"Wright park is good for long walks, jogging, biking, breathing fresh air and smelling that pine tree breezed air.Cleanliness is maintained.Pet friendly.Budget friendly stores selling souvenirs.Horseriding activity.And lastly, that iconic huge dog where you can have tour picture taken with him for only Php50.00 (unli shots)."
Wright Park,We visit here around 5 pm it's not crowded since the park is about to close. We just took some photo and leave.
Wright Park,During our visit there was no flowers although the area is clean and well maintained.
Wright Park,"Very nice to loiter around,  not so crowded at this time. We had great fun!"
Wright Park,"I would suggest to go horse  back riding at camp john hay insteadThey have improved the trail but I would just personally recommend to do this at camp john hay :)Btw be mindful of the time, it is the 2nd time where we experienced the guide telling us that time is up even though we're just half way through our paid time. üôÑ"
Wright Park,Kids enjoyed the Horseback ride. laughter from the kids is priceless...
Wright Park,"You can see the place is well maintained and cared by the city and its people. The grass are trimmed, no trash onsite and vendors have their own alley. They allow you to take pictures close enough but not too closed. Regular people do not have access to the mansion itself unless they are probable invited on special occasions."
Wright Park,you can never go wrong with Wright Park. emzüòÅüòä
Wright Park,Prepare your knees for the few steps üòÖ better start from The Mansion to Wright Park. Where you can ride the horses.
Wright Park,"I have to say, we enjoyed the whole trekking! ‚ô•Ô∏è"

Wright Park,"Amazing Experience riding  Horse, i am not ok by the smell of the  though, you can smell the urine of horses. But the experience and the peoples there are amazing"
Wright Park,"This park is perfect for those who are soul-searching or simply just want to escape from the loud city. Ideal place for a walk, meditation, relaxation and more."
Wright Park,I highly suggest to go here in the morning to enjoy the park and its cold climate. Its always a plus for me when one can enjoy the place without that much noise.There are beautiful flowers (but no picking). It is known for horseback riding and photo opportunity with dogs like Beethoven!
Wright Park,"This place is a must if you want to experience riding a horse and strolling in it within the vicinity. From the park, the Mansion is also accessible from here by foot through the stairs.The smell of horses and its dung is strong so for those who probably can not take it, just be ready and bring masks or towels."
Wright Park,"Finally got to enjoy this place lately as a Baguio local because it's been one of the most peaceful places during quarantine (since john hay is only open during sundays). Good for dog walks especially the trail, jogging, biking, skating and any other leisure. I haven't visited this place for several years as it gets easily flocked by tourists. Feels good to enjoy our own home!"
Wright Park,"A nice place to hang around upon visiting The Mansion. Lots of treat and souvenir to choose from. It has a wide space for horseback riding,  traditional attires to wear for picture taking, and of course, the cool weather to enjoy more the scene. However, there are undisciplined people who keep on throwing their trash anywhere they desire."
Wright Park,Here is a nice place to take a stroll and enjoy the surroundings. With great views and perfect weather you can enjoy spending some time here. I found there to be plenty of food options sweet and savour. Theres a chance to explore on horseback for a small fee. It can get busy here. With a short walk to the end of the park you will see the mansion this really is a well kept clean area. Take some great pictures with friends or family or even a quick selfie.
Wright Park,"The pine trails is a nice addition, specially if there are only few people visiting.  Please keep it like that and don't over develop."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"One of the best gardens I visited. This place  is Eden-like cozy version. If you are dreaming of going to Denmark or Amsterdam or any European countries but on a very tight budget, this is a good alternative.The place is clean, the flowers are beautiful. The ambiance of the place is relaxing. There are food stalls too where you can just sit, eat, relax, stroll and repeat.This is also a good place to propose!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Marvel at the best landscape architectural project I have ever seen. Don't be fooled by it's name this isn't your typical plant based attraction.This place will be very hard to explain in words so it is best if you see it in personal. It has different cultural gardens. It has a great play with elevation. It has tunnels it has great paid comfort room that brings you deep inside the rain forest. But most importantly, it has a coffee shop situated perfectly to feast your eyes with a view."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"For entrance fee of just 10 pesos, you can spend time with your friends and family in this beautiful and newly renovated garden. Go on a weekday if you can to avoid the crowd. There is a milk tea stall in the middle of the park if you want refreshments, and a cafe near the entrance. Take time to see the cacti collection. Restrooms are clean. Highly recommended to both locals and tourists."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"This is a beautiful place to visit if your staying a few days in Baguio. I saw so many different varieties of flowers and plants, that I hadn‚Äôt ever seen before. There were a lot of people here so be patient you will get your turn to view. Also there is a very low admission fee. Your camera‚Äôs are going to enjoy this location."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Newly improved botanical garden. With improved ambiance. When you want to shoot or pictorial you need a permit @ the entrance. Don not worry for your safety there are guards roaming around. Also restrooms are within the vicinity, you need to pay for maintenance aside from the entrance fee. Enjoy the view!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I visited Baguio Botanical Garden twice already. My first time was in June 24, 2022, then second time was on my birthday August 4, 2022. They have an entrance fee of 10.00 pesos only. It's worth it, beyond worth it. I enjoy visiting this place. It's like everytime you visit, you still discover something new in the place. You got to experience different ambiance as they have Japanese Garden, Korean Garden and lot more. You can see lots of plants, flowers and succulents which I love. You can discover new species of plants that you do not usually or rarely see in your own place. If you go to Baguio, I recommend this place for you to visit. If I go to Baguio for the third time, I will definitely visit the Baguio Botanical Garden again."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It's good to be back here after a decade and I liked that they have developed this place. You only need to pay P10 entrance fee which is very cheap. The rest room is very clean and spacious. There are lots of beautiful spots for picture taking but expect to share the place with lots of tourists. All in all, it's a very relaxing place worth visiting when you're in Baguio."
Baguio Botanical Garden,great place with a beautiful scenery!! if you like to walk and just admire the surroudings then this is for you! The best thing would be that the entrance fee is only 10 pesos yer you get to see a great view! Tables are also available around so I guess you can bring food for snacks there but there is also a cart inside that sells coffee.
Baguio Botanical Garden,One of the newest open attraction in Baguio after two years of closed because of pandemic.They made a lot of changes in their landscaping. It looks more beautiful now than before.Just visit and see the new scenery.
Baguio Botanical Garden,There was a 10 pesos entrance fee per person. Super nice place to walk around specially if you are into plants. The park has different sections that have their own themes. Be prepared to walk and climb stairs though
