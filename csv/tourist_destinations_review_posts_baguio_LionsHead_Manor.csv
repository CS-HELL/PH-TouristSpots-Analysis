The Manor at Camp John Hay,"While the facilities are a bit dated (which is to be expected with any historic property) the staff here were extremely attentive and on point. In addition, we were here during a 7.0 earthquake and I found the preparedness and professionalism of all the staff to be beyond reproach. They immediately evacuated all guests and immediately provided water, food, and blankets.  They made sure the building was safe before letting anyone back inside.  I commend everyone here for such a high level of service.  Bravo!"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Such a beautiful stay located in an extremely pleasant location!The staff are courteous, the interiors are beautiful and the food was amazing!The rooms are so well maintained and the views at the break of dawn would steal your heart!They also offer bicycles for rental which is a must try in the hilly roads - a fantastic experienceA definite stay place if you're in Baguio !!"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"This will be a biased review as this is one of the place we stay in when in Baguio for our annual business vacation. The elegance and comfort afforded by the facilities is something I haven't seen in any other place here in Baguio. The staff are all courteous, friendly, efficient - and since we are here often, recognize us as regular guests.🙂The grounds of this hotel are expansive but always clean and we'll maintained. The indoor seating in public areas always allow for small nooks, crannies, pockets where you can just relax, have a drink, and enjoy the calming ambiance of the hotel.🙂Admittedly this place is pricey - but it's worth every peso. Baguio to me equates to The Manor. It's not Baguio unless we stay here.Tip: book your trips in advance. We learned to reserve and pay for our next visit on the day we checkout. Therefore, we're always assured that we can be accommodated each and every time.😊We'll be back again in December, and I can wait for that time to come.😊😊Rooms: GoodNearby activities: GoodFood & drinks: Good"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"The best part about The Manor in Camp John Hay is the location. You're in what I consider to resemble most closely my childhood memories of visiting Baguio as a kid. The crisp cold air with the hint of that distinct pine smell is there - not so much in the city. We tried to go to the city the first day but gladly retreated back to Camp John Hay and didn't come back. Baguio City was just too busy. Plus, Camp John Hay has 3 small commercial areas nearby with restaurants, horse back riding, mini golf and a small area to bike with the kids. There's just enough activities within arm's length to fill a 3-day, 2-night visit that you don't feel the need to leave. There were 2 other places to stay nearby. I would try the Forrest Lodge as an alternative to the Manor next time. The rooms at the Manor are dated but iconic and well-maintained. The service was very kind but inconsistent maybe because the place was fully booked. Plenty of parking at the back."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"The rooms are dated but very clean. Front desk and front of house staff are excellent. The dining room service is very slow setting up your table and we had to ask for water glasses, cutlery ect.  Buffet stations were often vacant and plates had to be ""borrowed"" from other stations. Coffee was not available. The breakfast was definitely NOT worth the 1,900pp charged."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Beautiful.  Magical. Amazing. I guess it's worth it based on the price of the rooms there (9k/night). You can rest well and the staff are very accomodating.  However, we were not informed that breakfast wasn't included in the stay. So you need to pay i think it was 1k+ for the buffet not really sure. But it was really good. Their Beef tapa is a must try!  So many activities available for guests, too!"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Laborious check in and check out procedure. For check out I had to talk to the desk THREE times. First attempt, can’t check out because the rest of my group is still waiting in the room for the bell hop. Second attempt, I was told they unsuccessfully verified my room because people were still in it. Third attempt, all he had to say to me was that our room had been verified. Each time I was asked to have a seat (there were no available chairs in the lobby). What a waste of time!The morning of departure we received THREE phone calls from the front desk. First, to confirm our reservation for the shuttle. Second and third, to remind us that check out was 1+ hours from that time.They kill you with the shuttle charges. Paid 300-900 for each ride when taxi equivalent is 100-150. There’s no number for a taxi so if you ask for one, you are at the mercy of whether one drives by.Breakfast was overpriced, considering what it is.BUT:Rooms were great. We enjoyed everything we bought from the bakery. I had an excellent massage at the spa."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,Customer service sucked! We waited nearly 2 hours beyond the check-in time for our room to be ready. The kitchen forgot to deliver our rice. The manager was gracious enough to offer discount and waived the bed fee for my additional guest. The servers DO NOT KNOW HOW TO LISTEN! …More
The Manor at Camp John Hay,Rooms were spacious but furnitures were outdated. Service was superb. We called to request for things we needed several times and the staff were kind enough to bring them to our guest room. If you like to be away from the city this is a very nice place to stay in but commuting is almost impossible. You must bring your own car as the hotel is in the middle of camp john hay.
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Well maintained place but the  front desk customer service should improve.  They are not welcoming at all and even during my check out the lady was kinda snobbish! The restaurant though all waitresses were very good! Also, the bell boys are also very helpful and polite! …More"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Expensive vs the rooms that are already old. Not very clean. Do not make a mistake of requesting for extra bed as per night cost is about 3500 where one can stay already in other newer hotels but with added privacy. Plus breakfast is not even included in very high rate. If i go back to baguio i will stay in newer hotels.Rooms: Big with nothing in them. Seemed like prepared for extra beds. Expensive but facilities are old, small bathrooms.Walkability: Has access to nearby baguio country club, can walk to techno hub where there are lots of food choices. But noy near public mRket.Food & drinks: Expensive"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,It's a very busy hotel. Took forever to get stuff brought up and we argued about motorcycle parking. They wanted us to park far away when there were amble parking spaces beside the hotel that could fit 2 expensive motorcycles. It's a good hotel but it didn't feel 5 stars. …More
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Bell boys and guards at the lobby were pleasantly welcoming, not the case with the ladies and a gent on the front desk. Nice rooms, not the biggest. Complementary fruits upon arrival. Rooms had iron and umbrella, no robes. Our room was a bit hot since were facing the open grounds. Breakfast buffet was okay, loved the Filipino selections. Waiters could be more attentive.. Didn't know there was a complementary Jacuzzi til I we checked out lol. We were here during the earthquake and I would like to commend Manor for their prompt and much prepared response."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"This was a nice hotel. The staff are nice and pleasant. The food is good. Rooms are good. Price was decent. I would've given this place a 5 star if not for one problem. When we arrived two of our rooms were not check-in ready. We've waited for an hour and half after check-in time to occupy  them. The staff didn't follow through had I not followed up. After many times deliberately bugging them on the phone they finally got the rooms ready, 1.5 hours later. Granted they allowed us to stay later than the regular check out time. But we didn't need to stay longer as we had a schedule to follow to take advantage of our trip. A partial refund or perhaps an upgrade would've been preferable or maybe a complementary dinner or breakfast, but we didn't get any of that, just a late check out that we didn't need. Other than this unfortunate incident everything else went great at this hotel. The vibe and smell reminds me a little bit of Big Bear Lake cabins in California. Furthermore, I was quite disappointed that there were no Christmas decorations yet. Normally this place would've been festive this time of the year, but not even a Christmas tree or a Christmas lantern is in sight. I guess they must've lost their festive spirit during the pandemic. I would've deducted another half a star for this if I had the option.Would I revisit this place again? If the promo is too good to turn down maybe. I was not blown away by my first visit. I was hoping it would've been positively memorable. If not for my family making it a special event this place would just be another hotel along the way."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,Rooms are always nice and relaxing and great for staycations. The shower needs a minute or so to heat up the water. There was a rude staff last time we were there but the manager was so apologetic and made sure we didn't see the employee the rest of our stay. Location is also perfect for us as we always stay inside CJH. …More
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"We usually go here for breakfast buffet - it's worth the penny usually. However, Last time we went for dinner (not buffet), our experience was not so good. It was a Thursday night, no special occassion and not a holiday. the place was not packed and there were several empty tables. We started ordering at 6:30pm and the main course arrived almost 2 hours later, after a few follow ups from the food servers. Salad and soups - arrived about 90 minutes after orders were placed. one order was even left out and so we had to remind the order taker that we still had one pending order - which arrived around 8:30pm, when all of us in our table (except one guest) were done eating. If the food we ordered took really that long to prepare, then it would have been nice if expectations were set in terms of how long we should be waiting, so we could have resorted to picture taking or a quick fix in SB while waiting.. or something."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Everything about The Manor is excellent. The rooms, food, staff were very excellent. My family have always booked here when it's holidays. I recommend staying here when going to Baguio. …More"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"We stayed here for two days last September. My husband watched the teleserye Forevermore and wanted to go here while on vacation. This hotel is kind of old but it is beautifully maintained. The staff are all good looking, cordial and helpful. We arrived around 12nn but we didn’t have to wait long. The room was ready and they let us check in early.Our room is so spacious, it could accommodate an entire family. They gave us welcome fruits and daily trail mix we can snack on each night. I find that sweet and thoughtful. 😊 I also like that provided really good complementary coffee pods and teas. Our room is overlooking the garden. The view from our room is stunning. I like looking at mountains and beautiful cloud formations. In the evening, we can hear the band singing for guests dining at Le Chef. It’s free sound trip for me and my husband. 😜🤭There are tourists spots around the area that are walking distance. We strolled around and took lots of pictures. There’s also a place nearby where you can ride a horse and take you through an eco trail.We had a memorable stay here at the Manor. I wish we could stay longer. 😊"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Beautiful botonical gardens with a mix of gorgeous pines. Older and rustic rooms with no A/C. If you like it more quiet, get rooms facing the back. The front is busy and noisy due to street traffic and service entrance. I give the service 4 stars because they catered to some outside their norm services (coffee to go). Otherwise, nice but average service. Dining and food were ok. Did enjoy the Sinigang salmon belly and pork tenderloin."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,Rooms and service are ok the usual for this star class hotel.Parking spaces need to be improve though.Had to walk around 80 to 100meters from parking to hotel entrance.Yup its not much of a walk but imagine walking uphill from parking stairs. I suggest to have a golf cart/car sort of transpo..not everyone wants their car to be driven by others.
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Nice place to dine. The raisin bread is a must try. The foos they serve is good. The overnight experience in their rooms is relaxing but can be better. While the hotel is well maintained, some upgrades in the electric wiring and plumbing might be overdue. I alao think that they cosider late check outa specially if there arent many guests. I like though that the hotel staff are nice and politeRooms: The rooms are cozy and i had a good rest. There are no electric outlets near the work area table. The toilet has to be flushed four times. The watwr heating loaes its heat after being in the shower for a while.Nearby activities: There are a lot of olaces to walk around. The hotel is well lit in the evening and ia good for a photo opSafety: We walked around the hotel vicinity in the evening and the place was relatively safeFood & drinks: The food they serve is good. The hawaiian pizza and salmon that we tried is awesome. I recommend thiugh that the bread they serve is heated"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"A nice hotel to visit. The cold ❄️  ambient temperature is a plus. The food is delicious, staffs are kind and approachable. However, be prepared for the price of each food, room, and service. …More"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"This hotel was a very pleasant surprise. Great atmosphere, fantastic staff and wonderful location. Great for families, romantic getaways or just relaxing and forgetting about the world. …More"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Price is justified given the quality of the rooms, utilities, and services. Highly recommend the spa! Food is a bit overpriced for me, but the cheese platter is reasonable with wine."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Traditional 5 star hotel.Rooms are fairly large. You can feel  it's an old building, though renovated to suit modern tastes.Room amenities are ok. Bring an extension cord as there are few outlets in the room for todays gadget filled lifestyle.No aircon, you dont need it here.Let the cool fresh air into your room.Overall, still five stars."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"5 star hotel in the Summer Capital of the Philippines, my stay there was great experience, the food was also great. One thing ive notice is the parking not enough for the hotel u have to park at the nearby hotel parking but its also part of the Mano like sister hotel and it has a path walk connecting hotel and its good walk 4 our body and the ambieance is very nice malamjg refreshing habang nglalakad...👍👍👍"

The Manor at Camp John Hay,Just celebrated our 6th year of marriage this night and have a dinner for two with my beautiful wife... Great and delicious food. Thank you very much....... …More
The Manor at Camp John Hay,A nice place to stay but rooms can be updated.  Lobby impressive.  Staff friendly and helpful.Rooms: Rooms are not updated.  Not worth the money they charge for rooms.Nearby activities: Beautiful garden and Christmas decorations.Food & drinks: Food okay but overpriced.
The Manor at Camp John Hay,Place is so relaxing. Staff are all very helpful and always ready to assist. Walking around the place gives a sense of healing
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"We booked on Agoda for our prenup, 3 weeks before the said date. Then, just a week before the scheduled accommodation, they just cancelled the reservation - no assistance to find alternative and refund still pending until now. …More"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Morning buffet is good, friendly staff, clean surrounding, taste food, ie tapa not salty perfectly cook,, i love it."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,Really beautiful Christmas decors! Just a bit disappointed- we weren’t able to go inside to take photos bc there was an event ongoing
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Conveniently located at the heart of Camp John Hay - this is a big plus. Rooms are spacious and comfortable, however have this old look and feel. Hotel main parking is small and usually full. High room prices do not include breakfast. May be a good deal for groups of 4 when booked at significant discount, otherwise would recommend checking other hotels in the area."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"for a fee P1500 dinner buffet, we enjoyed the food and family bonding. complete vaccination cards are also checked, ace masks required. there's no more ala carte served at the Le Chef resto. only buffet served breakfast time and dinner …More"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,Classy country style hotel in the forest. Enjoy the vibes here a lot. Room is clean and spacious.
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"We went there to eat dinner. The food was delicious especially the bread. I ordered salmon and it was yummy. Of course, as given, this place has expensive taste in it. …More"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,The food was superb! Our stay was panalo! Went here on official business. The best!
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"The Manor at Camp John Hay in December is wonderful. Every corner is magical. Loved the decors and family-friendly activities. The hotel is perfect for kids during Christmas time, For sure they will enjoy the outdoor film showing with picnic mats prepared for the guests, and the mini bonfire for roasting marshmallows too! :)The staff are friendly and attentive so that's a bonus. It's also worth mentioning how their valets carefully sanitize every part of your car that they touched, as well as the keys before handing it back to you. :) Those small things at this time is truly something worth appreciating.Will surely visit again soon."

The Manor at Camp John Hay,I like the place even before we booked a room. I can still remember the promise I made for myself 🙂. All the staff were very courteous and helpful. We enjoyed our stay. The food was delicious. The room was clean and comfortable. I would dwfinitely come back!
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"There was a live band in an event hosted by Manor last weekend and the crowd (guests) had so much fun!The ambiance of this place is unmatched in Baguio in my opinion. It's dated but elegant vibe adds up to the overall experience when you stay here. They do have some restrictions on clothing if you dine in the hotel's restaurant.Rooms are comfortable, but if you move a lot while asleep, it may be bothersome to whoever shares the bed with you.It is few mins drive away from main attractions in the city so having a car getting there makes it easy. Hotel can organise cabs to pick you up too when needed so it's easy to get around."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Stopped in for the eats at the main restaurant.  A delicious selection of western style foods.  Nice views.  Not long ago this was on a closed campus, open only to US military taking some R&R. …More"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,I was there for the breakfast buffet...food is excellent! Good ambiance...great service...
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"The Manor at Camp John Hay is the ONLY ""remnant"" of the Baguio that I loved. Back in the 80's Baguio smelled like pine trees and there's zero pollution. Staying in this hotel makes you experience all that again. The food at Le Chef has not changed through the years. It's just unfortunate that you cannot make a reservation during breakfast or dinner even if you're a guest of the hotel.Another thing that I've noticed was that, you can hear the banging of doors from the hallway. Unlike before rooms were airtight that you can sleep peacefully. I hope they get to fix that.Still, The Manor will always be a 5 for me....."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,Rooms are well appointed with modern amenities. Welcome treats to room occupants are still appreciated. One of the less crowded hotel restaurants in Baguio. Staff is very courteous. Food is great. Tasted their lunch set last week and its value for money. Made some changes for my order to the listed combo and they gladly accommodated the requested change.
The Manor at Camp John Hay,Great place to stay in Baguio. The hotel is designed like a big log cabin and the service is excellent. Although you may want to book your stay 6 months ahead since this hotel is very popular in Baguio City
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Inconsiderate management, closed early on us despite their website clearly stating store hours. Ashley Garcia was particularly rude and unaccomodating. …More"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"We went for a quick meal and for breads at the bakery.Upside: the Manor remains a stately landmark at Camp John Hay. The staff are highly trained. The Sakura garden and its petting zoo is a pleasant addition to the Easter celebration. Also a pop-up bazaar was available at the garden.Downside: a service vehicle to and from the city would be great as a service to guests who aren't driving. Not advisable to visit without a car, it's too remote for taxis and Grab service. If you're not staying in, might not be worth checking out.Do we recommend this place? YesAre we going back? Maybe"
The Manor at Camp John Hay,Aircon not needed.Lavish Baguio's centralized air conditioning at the level of luxery.  The amenities and activities within the Manor is splendid.It is advise to have your own vehicle to get around outside the Manor.
The Manor at Camp John Hay,I loved the outdoor dining area that we had a great dinner with my partner.
The Manor at Camp John Hay,Kyle Avellano of the frontdesk knew what Filipino hospitality is all about. He would remember the guest and their activities. He really put ang extra mile for Manor's guest to feel at homeEverything is instagrammable. Spacious room and great housekeeping esp in room 310.It:s my second time to check in this year
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Place is ok, room is spacious, and they have a mini kitchen, a ceiling fan, and ironing facilities in the room,  but for me it is already overrated since their interior and room design are dated.We booked here because we thought it is a peaceful and quiet place, but it was not. Throughout our stay, we could hear guests laughing and talking very loudly, even if they were six rooms away. Kids on the next veranda shout at the trees for no reason at all!!! We are on the 4th floor, but we can hear kids in the parking below running and shouting. When their staff is passing by our room with their rolling cart, our room vibrates. Very annoying. I hope they can maintain peace and silence on their premises.Also, they don't have in-room slippers.Toilet doesn't have an exhaust fan, or it isn't working.I love their fluffy pillows."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Definitely part of the top 3 places to stay at in Baguio, may also be number 1 depending on your tastes or amenities you aim to experience. The Manor is an experience on its own, and you can spend the whole day just exploring the grounds, adding this Hotel/Resort to your itinerary. The food is great, and there are delicacies that can only be tasted here. The amenities are world class, and the staff are accomodating for all your needs. The rooms are spacious, the beds and pillows are very comfortable, and the ""garden"" is another must-experience location for tourists and locals alike. Since this is a top rated lodging, the parking space they have near the entrance, albeit abundant, is almost always full; but they still have a lot of parking space at the back (The Forest Lodge) for guests. The view from the rooms is also breathtaking especially if the weather conditions align well."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Well what can I say, Great, awesome, superb!!! The accommodation, ambiance, the whole place, customer service, buffet and location of The Manor offers nothing but great experience."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,The ceiling fan is noisy and I can taste the charcoal on both Australian  lamb loin and Angus beef so it's hard to differentiate the taste of beef and lamb.. may be that's their chef's specialty ✌️ …More
The Manor at Camp John Hay,The interior is decent and sufficient for Baguio homey setup. The view outside is simply  stunning most especially in the afternoon. I appreciate the attentiveness of the crews particularly the valet parking crew. My car key ran out of battery. The alarm went off almost causing annoyance. They ran to the nearest store to buy a replacement. They saved me from embarrasment. 🙂
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Checked in last January 2 to 4. The place is amazing, but service is a bit of a disappointment. Service can be improved drastically.Check in time is 3PM and we were given the room at 3:15 PM, considering we arrived and checked in so early (12 noon). Room service TAT also takes some time."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,It was an evening full of happy views. There were Christmas lights and displays. There was outdoor movie viewing paired with cool wind and great food.We first went to the bakeshop to buy pastries but the view invited us to roam around and treat our eyes with the beautiful Christmas decors all over the place.

The Manor at Camp John Hay,it was great to experience real cold christmas feels at the manor hotel with their christmas village plus the fake snow added more fun and white christmas feels. they have a play area for kids and outdoor and indoor resto...
The Manor at Camp John Hay,The location is very nice the rooms are ok but for the price paid per night are not up to standard. The internet in the rooms is terrible. It’s 2022 with kids online school and people needing internet connection sad had to use pocket WiFi in the room. Carpets need to be cleaned. Staff is ok need upgrade in service. Room key card stopped working several times during the stay very frustrating. You have to pay for everything ice parking and even need to make reservations at hotel restaurant even though your a guest. Really the hotel is ok but for the amount of money you pay the total doesnt match up to the cost of the vacation. Stayed here in The past was much better maybe the pandemic had impact on the hotel.
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Still one of the best places to visit and stay in Baguio (although we stayed at The Forest Lodge next door). They allow kids to dine in alfresco areas and roam and play in their large garden. Sadly, no breakfast buffet due to health and safety reasons. But the food is still excellent."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"Great buffet! Awesome garden, clean rooms."
The Manor at Camp John Hay,"We've enjoyed our stay and the food here, i also bought some exclusive clothes in their souvenir shops. So happy to spend our family time here. Will definitely be back again next christmas hehe."
Lion’s Head,"One of iconic tourist spots of Baguio that you shouldn't miss.During pandemic, it is recommended to strike a deal with your taxi driver to go to and fro here, coz the passing public vehicles are limited.It is not crowded during pandemic compared to before."
Lion’s Head,This is always a worthy stop-over. Everyone should pay homage to this post-modern structure for a bathroom break or a taste of that home-made strawberry ice-cream or to just take a snap of the big lion which i do all the time.
Lion’s Head,"It is quite far from the city. And as of August 2022 (during our visit) limited people are allowed in the area since the Kennon is no longer used as way going down to Manila.We were the only tourist during our visit, so you do not have to wait that long to take photos"
Lion’s Head,"The Lion'S Head:One of the most iconic tourist attraction in Baguio that you shouldn't miss! It's along Kennon Road and it's a landmark when entering Baguio City! It's free for all so have fun taking a selfie or groupies with the the beautiful sculpture made of limestone.👉 PS: You may watch, like, comment and SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel 😘"" Arlene Aces """
Lion’s Head,This is a marker thst tells you that you are now entering baguio city. Enjoy take some pictures and have some fun. Just make sure to clean up your mess once you start again. Better yet just tale many pictures as you can. Make as many momories as you can. And leave nothing but foot print no trash.

Lion’s Head,One of the iconic and most visited tourist spots in Baguio. One can say that you should visit this place when you go to Baguio.There were a lot of people when we visited. There were also taho and ice cream vendors.

Lion’s Head,This is a 40ft limestone sculpture by a Cordilleran artist commissioned by the Baguio Lions Club (a civic organization of the wealthy) during the dark era of martial law. It's a giant club ad and it's become a landmark since then. Although I think a lion doesn't fit in the Philippine context. But this is a cute stop along Kennon Road. Kids would love this. The views beside the lion showcase the mountain ranges. There's a parking lot for 10 or more vehicles beside the Lion's head. Not much to do here except take pictures and go. You can also support the local vendors by purchasing pasalubong.

Lion’s Head,Lion' Head was somewhat creepy on the its left side when facing it at night. I think they need to put on lights around the statue to look more formal and not intimidating.

This can be reached (when you’re coming from Baguio) within 30 minutes. There are also several pasalubong / souvenir stalls in its vicinity."
Lion’s Head,The view is nice and when we got there there a no to few people. The activity you can only do there is have a picture taken and buy some strawberry taho before going to the city.

Lion’s Head,Baguio experience will not be complete without having a picture with the Lion😎
Lion’s Head,"Too crowded, just need to find a spot on the opposite side of the road. But enjoyed the ube flavored taho from local vendors. …More"
Lion’s Head,"Well the place is very beautiful, I fact the journey down the hill from top of the mountain until this point is beautiful. Due to landslide ahead we could not go beyond this point. Very clean and very good people around, try to click pictures in Baguio traditional dress just next to the lions head"
Lion’s Head,"Crowded and noisy but awesome to visit for souvenirs. Just a warning though you should be here early because of the traffic parked vehicles are causing and oh this place is a tourist trap, just take a photo of the big Lion's Head and head on your way."
Lion’s Head,nice 👍 . been wanting to see this ever since.
Lion’s Head,One of the most iconic landmark of Baguio is the Lion's Head. Best to visit on your way up to Baguio by driving through the scenic Kennon Road.
Lion’s Head,This spot is one of the most tourist attractions that definitely make it to your bucket list.
Lion’s Head,This iconic landmark of Baguio seems to be in disrepair when we went there. A little repainting job could make it look better.
Lion’s Head,"Livelier than ever before with snack vendors (taho, ice cream) and souvenir shops. Traffic enforcers are also helpful with parking."
Lion’s Head,There is already a parking space now just beside the statue which is very helpful
Lion’s Head,"Great, iconic monument unlike the ravaged statue of the evil plunderer/ “mega magnanakaw” on the other longer road to Baguio."
Lion’s Head,Baguio with Friends🙌🏻😌 thank you abby for driving us here😄 buti nalang. Heheh
Lion’s Head,"When we arrived at the kennon road triage, this was the first landmark we dropped by. There are lots of seller selling strawberry flavored taho. It's really good, you can also ask them to take your picture. ❤️"
Lion’s Head,"Nice view, you can picture the awesomeness of lions head structure."
Lion’s Head,"Good to be back here, lions head seems newly painted, sadly unable to capture the lions head itself due to my faulty camera, anyways the view is nice"
Lion’s Head,"Lion's Head is a popular tourist destination along Kennon Road going to Baguio. I rated 3 stars because I am of the opinion that it has lost somehow the prestige because of the too many tourist footprints. Nevertheless, it is still one of the tourist spots in Baguio, Benguet Province."
Lion’s Head,Great and nice place
Lion’s Head,"Kenon road is ""somewhat"" always closed but if you asked nicely, you'd be able to go. Lion is neat and newly painted. There were few people and almost had the place for ourselves. Less tourists while there's the nCoV scare. A viewing deck is being constructed nearby. I suggest coming here during summer. There's a need to deal with a huge crowd though."
Lion’s Head,Nice place for stopover before going to city proper via Kennon Road.Make sure your car is in good condition before going to this place.
Lion’s Head,Experience the beuatiful place in the Philippines. The summer capital. …More
Lion’s Head,"Typical statue in honor of the lions club family. But the view makes it astonishing. Too bad, mining on baguio caused the landslide that could be seen on this area."
Lion’s Head,A little crowded with everyone who wants to take a photo of the Lion's head
Lion’s Head,"Many cyclists come to take pictures here, its such a wonderful place worth to ride"
Lion’s Head,The place is good even at night. There are less people.
Lion’s Head,"Another well-known landmark associated with Baguio is the Lion's Head. It is situated in the slopes of Kennon Road. This is one spot that's also popular with tourists so we've decided to head on to Manila early in the morning to avoid the crowd eager to take selfies/groufies with this famed structure. Parking could be an issue. Just an observation, the head didn't look as nice as it was in the old days. It changed a lot through the years, funnylooking lion esp. with it's color. So artificial."
Lion’s Head,"It makes me happy I finally have pictures taken from here. Although there was a paint signage that blocks the nice view in the left side of the Lion's Head, so far it was nice."
Lion’s Head,If your lucky enough when you pass by the head there's few people you cant get your photo beside it. Unfortunately when we passed its already late and there a lot of people there so i took this way far away (so that our car wont block the road since there are plenty of cars already parked near the vicinity). …More
Lion’s Head,The Experience was great. It's just that the prices was too expensive their compared to the city. …More
Lion’s Head,An amazing placeBaguio history
Lion’s Head,One the landmarks you'll see when you're getting near at Baguio. With stalls of pasalubongs and souvenirs in the area.
Lion’s Head,"A tourist spot icon along the popular Kennon Road welcoming the visitors of Baguio City. Nothing really in here, you just have to stop for a short picture taking and that's it!"
Lion’s Head,"As always, Baguio trip will not be complete without seeing this big Lions Head. Now newly repainted and maintained and of course with shops of the sides. Compliments to the government of Baguio as they secure it with cops and it shows they have prides and taking care on their tourist spots as well as the tourists."
Lion’s Head,A baguio must visit place...
Lion’s Head,"10 minutes finished all.beside road, only make photos. But there's some male CR really can give you surprise,if you try you will be know. And beside lions head have a tree growing on the stone, it is amazing."
Lion’s Head,Davies paint signage ruined/photobomb the view. It is usually crowded especially by the vans/cars of the tourists which causes traffic. But still its a nice place to see.
Lion’s Head,"Such a beautiful place, fresh air, many people are taking photos of Lion's head."
Lion’s Head,Iconic place for those who would want to have proof they have gone to Baguio. The place offers scenic parking space and lots of souvenir items. Nothing much to do here but it is a must to take pictures if you pass through Kennon Road.
Lion’s Head,"beautiful scenery, i really like the place"
Lion’s Head,"he origin of Baguio’s lion head is as colorful as the history of the road where it currently stands.When the Americans conquered the Cordillera highland in the 1900s, they had a hard time reaching the Benguet mountains. Establishing a short route to these mountains would greatly boost the local economy, so the American government soon launched an expensive road project, much to the dismay of politicians in Washington D.C"
Lion’s Head,"Very exciting to go there,that was my big dream came through ever. …More"
Lion’s Head,Just passed by this spot en route going home from Baguio. Novelty items and trinkets sold by various hawkers. There’s a public toilet available. Native Igorots are also available for souvenir photos. You might want to don a traditional costume and sit with them for a selfie. Kinda crowded on a Sunday afternoon. This will always remain a famous landmark for Baguio visitors.
Lion’s Head,Painting nicely done! And the view?! Lol sorry its already late but the view was great in the morning. Best stop after the long ride in kennon road.
Lion’s Head,One of the structures that signifies your are near Baguio
Lion’s Head,"Be a tourist in your own town,Welcome to Baguio City,City of Pines."
Lion’s Head,Amazing stone sculpture that stands in the rocky Highway of Benguet. …More
Lion’s Head,"Situated in a place located before entering Baguio City, the Lion's Head is a major tourist destination when visiting the City of Pines via Kennon Road. It is a gigantic concrete head of a lion made by the Lion's Club and it sorts of greets and welcomes all visitors who wishes to enter Baguio not only to escape the heat and stress from the big cities but also to experience the nice and cool weather and honest and friendly people that Bagiuo offers."
Lion’s Head,4:30am to 5:00am Monday morning …More
Lion’s Head,"The iconic Lion's head conceptualized by the Lions Club members of Baguio, is a must see spot. The new painting done by Baguio local artists (I assume) makes the Lion shows its boldness. It might get a little traffic around the area due to its popularity, few parking space is available, but worth seeing it fresh. You might get lucky on a weekday if few visitors would be around."
Lion’s Head,Very nice cooling weather at about just below 30°C being the highest. Don't even need an air conditioner at night to sleep.
Lion’s Head,"Well they said Lion Head welcomes you in Bagio, it was a nice place to take photo. Lion Head means your about to enter Bagio. Souveniers are available, Taho and Sorbetes ice cream strawberry flavored are available to. Carefull of magic snatchers, when parking your car makes sure its lock or leave someone to guard it. :)"
Lion’s Head,The lion sculpture is OK. Parking space are not organised. Too crowded not only by tourist but also by stalls/vendors
Lion’s Head,"Iconic Lion's Head that tells you youre in Baguio already coming from Kennon Road.Hope they open Kennon soon so we don't have to ply Marcos Hiway with those big trucks.Coming from the town proper, there's a checkpoint in fromt of the Kennon Viewpoint, you have to leave your License so they can guarantee that you will come back up and not pass by Kennon to Manila.Not a lot of people coming here these days compared before. Good thing they repainted the Lion, without make up like before!"
Lion’s Head,Nice location for viewing.People are organized.
Lion’s Head,"Quick stop, not much to do but surely you can get your strawberry taho/ice cream and pasalubongs here ☺️"
Lion’s Head,Historic Monument Indeed
Lion’s Head,Lion's Head is amazing! It makes every traveler's Baguio escapade complete.
Lion’s Head,You can see it even from afar still look the same. Nothing much to see or do …More
Lion’s Head,Nice scenic view behind the lions head. But the lion's head itself is old. Nothing special. It's way from the city is dangerous. Make sure your car works perfectly specially the brakes. But the view is worth it. Got few shops with toilet alongside this tourist spot.
Lion’s Head,"It's nice to see in a personal view,"
Lion’s Head,First stop in Baguio. Overcrowded. Almost can't park. Lots of Strawberry taho vendors; a must try. Beautiful view of the mountain. Very refreshing. The only problem was the parking HAHAHA!
Lion’s Head,"Ever since this was still black, never fail to fascinate me. Yet my heart is empty because I miss you so much mi Querida Señorita #maba."
Lion’s Head,"Really a true symbol on going up to Baguio City!Kudos to Ate whom we rented the igorot dress of my mother she is very respectful and friendly,  even the taho vendor they're all very warmth in welcoming guests of Lion's Head😊"
Lion’s Head,Great stop after going up through Kennon road.
Lion’s Head,A lot of people was there when we came and the trash was just left at the sides :(. There was a vendor selling strawberry taho for 30pesos and it was yummy! I hope they put trash cans 😅
Lion’s Head,"Good place to be, free itenerary. A must go for Baguio tourists. …More"

Lion’s Head,It is along the highway. You can buy more stuff here. Pasalubong

Lion’s Head,Landmark along Kennan Road leading up to Baguio. It looked more beautiful before the local government gave it a paint over.
Lion’s Head,"Amazing sculpture carved from the original rock. Lots of small stalls of souvenirs,very cheap."
Lion’s Head,I'm verry happy cause its my first time there and to see the beauty of Baguio and also Benguet but sadly it is pandemic so i didn't try to see the other places there b'cause of restriction..
Lion’s Head,People going to Bagio will not miss this huge Landmark located in Kenon Road
Lion’s Head,Looks good now. Less tourists in the afternoon.
Lion’s Head,"Childhood memories... it may be the oldest iconic landmark when baguio come into mind, do spend a bit of your time to take snap or two"
Lion’s Head,Nice scenery. We stopped here for a photo on the way back to Manila.
Lion’s Head,Great tourist spot for Baguio. Although I would love to see it back when it was naturally stone without the paint.
Lion’s Head,"Good souvenir for the times.. if going to Baguio, remember to stop by this monument"
Lion’s Head,"Its along the road where ypu can passed it if ypu are going on a private car. Its cute, its like your first stop in baguio. Enjoy"
Lion’s Head,It's been awhile since I last saw the big Lion guarding the place. Felt nostalgic. Great  tourist attraction!
Lion’s Head,Good tourist spot with overlooking view. Locals are friendly and helpful in taking photos and memories.
Lion’s Head,The famous Lion Head are already repainted and there's added attraction beside that the tourist can enjoy
Lion’s Head,Evade this place during the holidays. Crowded and you can't get a good photo with the huge lion statue anyway.
Lion’s Head,"Lot of souvenir shops arround, crowded place to take lion head pic"
Lion’s Head,First stop via Kennon Road.
Lion’s Head,Still one of the best tourist spots.

Lion’s Head,Nostalgic feeling. Been here 41 years ago☺️
Lion’s Head,best stop over from kennon road going to baguio
Lion’s Head,Snapping a picture in the iconic Lion's Head is a must when going to Baguio. The paint job during our December 2021 trip was the best by far.
Lion’s Head,Landmark on the way to Baguio.Now colored yellow instead of black in the 70s and 80s.
Lion’s Head,Perfect as its ever been
Lion’s Head,"Five stars cause why not, nice view, free, it's a bit boring and cliche though"

Lion’s Head,"Silent place, because this road is closed now"
Lion’s Head,"Unfortunately,Lion's head is under constraction on my first time visit during that day. ( so sad ) There is so much bamboo' surrounding the Lion's head."
Lion’s Head,Huge lions head so very cool to take a photo
Lion’s Head,First time to be here.
Lion’s Head,Nice place but the ads of Davies Paint should be reduced. It does not look good on the picture
Lion’s Head,"Great view to stop over, a little preview of the River Bued. If you're a tourist coming up yo Baguio via Kennon, do stop and admire the view."
Lion’s Head,Too many people to enjoy the place.
Lion’s Head,The place is in a major road going in and out of the city. Those who want to take picture with it must be extra careful in crossing tne road to have a better view. And limited parking spaces. So if you there already many cars parked better to schedule your visit during dead hours when tourist are usually hanging out somewhere else..  :)
Lion’s Head,Very impressive work of art
Lion’s Head,Manila inbound due to iatf friday saturday until 12n..outbound baguio during sunday 12n to 12n monday..
Lion’s Head,new paint.. nice
Lion’s Head,One of the beautiful spot in Baguio City were people take pictures as a remembrance in this place
Lion’s Head,Wow Leon Head Baguio City.
Lion’s Head,I stopped because..... Well because there was a huge lion head on the side of a mountain.  It was an interesting stop.
Lion’s Head,Lions head the prime landmark of Baguio
Lion’s Head,"The lion's head will look better without the souvenir shops near it. . .the stores should be relocated to the proper area but not adjacent to the lion's head.further, the lion's head should be repainted black, its original color. . .shops cause traffic near the area"
Lion’s Head,"there are souvenir shops around so if you are passing there, don't miss it"
Lion’s Head,It's an interesting stop on your way to Baguio.
Lion’s Head,A staple tourist spot for new Baguio tourists.
Lion’s Head,The view of the head is not that amazing as you think. A lot of local tourists take turn in taking photos.
Lion’s Head,"It's very popular and eye catching, but at the end of the day is not artistic, there is no particular view to enjoy and is very commercial: plenty of stalls selling any kind of cheap souvenirs. But yes : it's instagrammable 😊"
Lion’s Head,Nice view and stop over.
Lion’s Head,How ironic people living from nearby don't have any selfie moment's with this historic statue LOL
Lion’s Head,"Baguio is one of the most beautiful and one of the coldest places in the Philippines, and one of them boasts the lion head of Baguio, and it is my favorite to visit because here you can see the beauty that Baguio has. The scenery is very cool in this area, and it is common for our countrymen to try too nice experience."
Lion’s Head,"This is a ""head-turning"" Lion Head sculpture along the road to Baguio City. The sculpture itself is a great work of art. Many people stop here for a while to take photos, have their snack, go to the CR and buy something for themselves and for their loved ones. Well, not so impressive but it adds some excitement as you travel going up to the city."
Lion’s Head,Nothing much to see here... Quite a landmark tough...
Lion’s Head,Nice View
Lion’s Head,A great place to take photos but you'll encounter a lot of issue as you enter the area. It's along the road so be careful and watch your kids. Hard to get back to Baguio through commuting. Preferred to have a car to drive back to Baguio.
Lion’s Head,amazing stone works one of the attraction goin to Baguio City
Lion’s Head,"Great carving on a rock completed in 1972Lions clubs internationalThe Kennon Road Lion's head was the idea of the Baguio City Host Lions Club, a service organization that has its members volunteering for various humanitarian projects worldwide."
Lion’s Head,Kenon road is close but lions head is still accessible for picture taking... you'll just have to ask permission from checkpoint personnel.
Lion’s Head,"When you travle to baguio thru kenon road, you can see it."
Lion’s Head,Nice view. Lion's Head.
Lion’s Head,The City as a whole (Baguio) is generally cool. The view and everything. This lion head is a little bit far from the city. This should be the last place you visit if your next destination is Manila. The place is great.
Lion’s Head,a must see when you visit Baguio. this is one of the landmarks of Baguio that has attracted numbers of local tourists since it was put up. it is now newly painted and looks more like a lion than just a randomly painted fixture along Kenon road.
Lion’s Head,Iconic landmark before arriving at the city of pines.  A great & popular place to get a photo souvenir.
Lion’s Head,👍
Lion’s Head,Stop get a photo. Everybody does it. Cross it out of your list. Get it done.
Lion’s Head,"The place is great! Local shops for souvenirs and strawberries are  available. Can also take pictures on the Lion's head, St. Bernard dogs, and you wearing Igorot costume/attire."
Lion’s Head,Ganda here. You should visit too. …More
Lion’s Head,Fun time to take a photo of the lion head. Parking was very limited
Lion’s Head,Nice place to take a picture …More
Lion’s Head,Going up!
Lion’s Head,Very nice view
Lion’s Head,"Not only boring, but the Davies' paint company that must've painted the monument at no cost put up a giant sign literally bumping up to the head, littering it's appearance, making it impossible to get a photo without the sign in it. It's unbelievable that they allowed such a devastation to that monument."
Lion’s Head,Nice!
Lion’s Head,you must visit this place in kenon road.
Lion’s Head,The view is so nice to take pictures
Lion’s Head,I went pass that lion's head when i went to Baguio City.Its a nice town to visit provided that you need more warm jackets.Remember its usually cold high up in the mountain. Sometimes from 10 degrees down to 7 degrees..
Lion’s Head,This is a very historic attraction. We dropped off to this place before leaving Baguio however Kennon Road was closed for safety purposes. If Kennon road isn't passable people will have second thoughts to go there because it's quite far from the city proper.Tourists should visit the Lions Head even it's far from the city. The view is on the way there is so amazing!
Lion’s Head,"Near the end of the scenic Kennon Road is a famous sculpture of a lion's head. Parking is rather difficult to find due to the narrow road and sloping terrain. There are comfort rooms (15 pesos per use) and shops nearby. Since the best shots are taken right in the middle of the road, do be careful when taking pictures."
Lion’s Head,You weren't in Baguio if you had not passed by this popular monument here. Lots of stores selling all kinds of stuff which are usually the products of Baguio can be seen along the sides. Including these 2 St BernRd dogs. So cute and friendly- php20.00 if you would like to take a pic with them. LOL!
Lion’s Head,one of the many structures not to be missed when u are in baguio.
Lion’s Head,Very little parking. A good photo op place with vendors as well. Be prepared to donate 5 pesos to use the comfort room (restroom).
Lion’s Head,Quite dangerous to park if going down from Baguio so we need to be careful how we get off the car and get photos here. Usually very crowded too. Some taho vendors are nice. They share the people buying from them if buying in group (like we were). They are also nice enough take our photos. Even when initially we were not going to buy taho from them.
Lion’s Head,Your first stop going to Baguio.
Lion’s Head,high five!! having fun in here..
Lion’s Head,Wonderful places in baguio city
Lion’s Head,Ilove this iconic place in baguio.this is the real proof that you visited the summer capital of the country.
Lion’s Head,An iconic statue along Kennon road that keeps visitors curious for a stop before heading up to Baguio city. It has been repainted several times
Lion’s Head,"It's one of the city's most popular landmark with a new look. Thanks to the city local artist who braved the heat to bring a new vibe to this landmark. Complete ur baguio experience  by taking  kennon rd  on your next trip to baguio, for u not to miss out a  picture at the Lions Head."
Lion’s Head,beautiful as always
Lion’s Head,"First time experience at baguio, its great..."
Lion’s Head,Newly painted/renovated Lion Head
Lion’s Head,Nice place to picture …More
Lion’s Head,Nothing much to showcase. It's so hard to get a cab from there. We had to take a jeep for 23 sitting capacity and dropped us in Baguio plaza.
Lion’s Head,I wouldn’t specifically go here to check out the lion’s head. Nothing much to see anyway. It is a good short stopover tho if your way to Baguio is from Kenon Rd. Limited parking lots and it is a cause of traffic most of the time.
Lion’s Head,"This landmark has been an icon in Baguio City. Once you've reached this part of Kenon Road, this means you're very near. Brace yourself for the heavy traffic. Lots of tourists want to take a picture of this great lion and visiting Baguio City is not complete if you haven't taken a selfie or a grouphie with the lion."
Lion’s Head,"Davies Paint sponsored its paint, but shouldn't shamelessly photobomb the landmark. The makeshift souvenir shops contribute to the messy scene. Tourists compete with traffic just so they can look for a good vantage point for picture-taking. Why not mark the best spots?"
Lion’s Head,"Go there if you have a private vehicle with you. It's easy to go there when you commute by jeep,  but very difficult to commute going back to the city as the jeeps passing there are usually full."
Lion’s Head,This place is so memorable...
Lion’s Head,Nice view
Lion’s Head,Nice place to visit
Lion’s Head,"Awesome statue, restored around 1974. Great picture taking opportunity especially in the mountainous terrains surrounding it.Local roadside shops selling souvenirs, snacks and beverages."
Lion’s Head,The place is under renovation right now so I was kind of disappointed when we went there.
Lion’s Head,"Lion's head is a welcome tourist spot before entering the mean city of Baguio.People also at this place is very responsible greatful,helpful to all tourist.Also,In this place people are very strict specially in improper disposal of garbage. So we tourist must also have a disipline to avoid penalty."
Lion’s Head,Souvenirs and baguio stuffs available here.
Lion’s Head,its nice to be back!
Lion’s Head,Great place for a stop over. There are souvenirs which offers much cheaper price than the one in the city. This used to have ifugao dancing before but there is none now.
Lion’s Head,It's a sculpture of a lions head located on the old winding rood to Baguio - it is big yes but so what?It's just like so many other landmarks - if you have taken your picture get on with your life.
Lion’s Head,A great stop
Lion’s Head,"This is a ""welcome"" landmark to the city of Baguio.  It's at kennon road.   When you take a Baguio city tour this attraction is always on the list of photo opportunity must-haves.  Be careful.  Kennon is very narrow.  If driving, wait for the traffic personnel to guide you to your approved parking slot.  Busy at most times of the day except evening when standing on street can become dangerous."
Lion’s Head,Bring bck old memories
Lion’s Head,They say you've never been to Baguio if you haven't visited this place. A big rock shaped lion along Kennon road. A lot of stores surrounding the area selling souvenirs.
Lion’s Head,"It is suppose to be a 5 but recently the lion's head ave become the 'make-up artists dummy', their practice site. The head looks funny and not that mighty and king of the jungle-ish kind of thing. However, that doesn't mean that it doesn't deserve to be visited cause it's still a great place and worth visiting for."
Lion’s Head,🤓😎✔️
Lion’s Head,"If you take a taxi going here, ask if it could stay a while. Take a picture then go back. If your taxi can't wait, ride a jeep going down, it will come back up. Jeeps going up are usually full."
Lion’s Head,A very crowded place. Tourists should go up straight to the city because there's more to see aside from the lion's head and being the cause of traffic.
Lion’s Head,Nice place
Lion’s Head,its nice to have the addition of the St Bernard for kids to meet this type of breed.  and they dont have to go far to see the Katutubo dress as well as take pictures with Lion's head with family.
Lion’s Head,i think it is still on-going beautification during our visit. and also kennon road is closed.. so accessibility and iterinary/planning is a little off.
Lion’s Head,"Due to bridge construction going up to Kennon Road, traffic is terrible."
Lion’s Head,"First attraction to see in Baguio if you will be coming from Kennon Road. Parking is free alongside the road. There will be people assisting you while you park so better give them a tip. ""Strawberry taho (soya) - 30php"" and ""strawberry sorbetes (ice cream) - 25php++"" is available here as well."
Lion’s Head,This is the place you'll never forget to visit before exploring the city.
Lion’s Head,Only good for causing traffic jam and accidents.
Lion’s Head,"This place is where you can see a lion's head which is made up by rocks, is a very beautiful creature that made it more famous. It is one of a tourist spots in benguet wgere you can take a lot of pictures with it"
Lion’s Head,Lion looks better than before
Lion’s Head,It was nice.
Lion’s Head,A fun sight to briefly stop by to see.  Lots of vendors with food and souvenirs.  Take pictures with a giant stone lion head brought to you by the Baguio Lions club.
Lion’s Head,Baguio's welcoming usher-the lions head..one of baguio's landmark..

Lion’s Head,"I've passed by there once...Just passed, didn't stop, eh what's the point of the lion guys, I've asked many  but I always get the same answer, ""to take your picture and go"" lol, not when was it built, why?, by whom? What is it's purpose, also the the lion looks dumb as hell especially the colour choice, I mean, it's a lion, or should be.something a bit more regal than having a dumb look on its face with a shoddy paint job eh? My opinion  and yes it doesn't matter lol"
