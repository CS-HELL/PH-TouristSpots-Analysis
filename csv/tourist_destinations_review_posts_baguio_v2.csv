Burnham Park,"An excellent place for family and friends to visit. It has no entrance fees, and has a lake where you can ride a boat (P 150) and park grounds where you can ride small bikes (P 100). Not a place I would recommend at night as it gets quite dark here at some spots. But the morning is a superb experience you will definitely want to come back to."
Burnham Park,"A lovely place to be on a nice day.We were pleasantly surprised and very pleased at how long a period of time that we had aboard our boat on the lake.You may hire bicycles(some carrying as many as three people)on the cycle track for a modest fee,and once again the period of time allowed is most generous indeed ~ so it is good value for money.Spend time here is amazing. I love the place."
Burnham Park,"Definitely one of the best places to visit in Baguio. üíñ Burnham Park is a crowded tourist destination, but for good reason. The assortment of flowers that you will see in the park is truly breathtaking.Aside from sightseeing, you can also do boating, have your picture taken by a photographers' cooperative in tribal clothes, rent cars or bikes, and play at the amusement park."
Burnham Park,I have always been looking at this park ever since 2018. I only had the chance to review the park because I flexed the view of this park to my Japanese friend so that he can go here someday. Still crowded as ever. There's a lot of tourist as always. It is still fun to see everyone having fun here.
Burnham Park,Very beautiful park with boating and cycling available inside the park. Good place to relax and have clean air. Whenever I visit Philippines I make sure to visit Burnham park each time.
Burnham Park,A lot cleaner and crowd is more manageable more than ever. Police presence is constant so you feel more safe. More public CR are around and increased number of evenly spread out trash bins. Just make sure you do your part and clean as you go.
Burnham Park,Bring something to protect you from the heat of the sun when going up in this place. family vehicles are not  allowed to go up to this point because the area where you will see a good view of the tower and the west Philippines sea is not wide enough  for vehicles. tricycle fare per trip is 50 pesos as of 2022 with a maximum of 3persons per trip.
Burnham Park,"I/we enjoyed Burnham Park. We visited when it was busy and mellow, day and night. Felt safe. Numerous low level things to do for all ages. Fun to see nostalgic things to do (bumper cars, bike/pedal rentals) all sorts of food vendors, even massage people (but not sure where that happens).We had a picnic and someone offered (and we bought) blue tarp to sit on.Recommend and would return but wouldn‚Äôt call it a must see.Parking is hard to come by so walk or get dropped off is key."
Burnham Park,"Burnham Park is considered to be one of the most famous parks in the country. It is located on Jose Abad Santos Drive, Baguio City 2600 Benguet Philippines. A park is a popular place for both locals and tourists. This place is often full-packed with people regardless if it is rainy or not. The most well-known activity in the park is ‚Äúbiking‚Äù. There are lots of bicycles for rent at a very decent price. It is an excellent activity for youngsters and adults."
Burnham Park,"The place was also nice to see in the morning especially trying activities a family can enjoy like biking, riding a boat and having picnics. There are food area and lots of rest rooms. Parking is just hard during peak season. (Forgot to take pics since we just visit first in the evening for the night market üòä). The night market is beside the park."
Mines View Observation Deck,"I went on a weekend and it was overcrowded!!! Barely any space to move! Overcrowded just to see the views. You can buy souvenirs and food there. I got the üåΩ and it was yummy. The bathroom was clean though when I went. The ticket fee isn't pricey at all, but no parking unless you go early."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great place to visit. Don't forget it to your itinerary. However, sometimes it's too crowded that it's hard to get decent photos of yours because there are a lot of people especially during weekends. Luckily I was able to get these photos. Love the scenery."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Come to Mines View Observation Deck to breathe and relax away from work!My friends and I went here very early to watch the sunrise. I managed to get few snaps of the place as it was jam packed with tourists from other parts of the Philippines. On a hindsight, it is always like this whenever I come to Baguio. This place never run out of tourists. And one do understand why... Had I happen to live near here, I'd also frequent this site.We no longer took pictures with the horses nor with igorot costumes on and whatever there are. We just wandered the Mines View Park to appreciate what's in there and buy food and clothing to bring home as souvenir to our love ones.We had our breakfast just outside the Park where a canteen offers inexpensive but satisfying food nonetheless while waiting for the Good Shepherd Convent to open because we'd buy their products like the famous ube jam.In the years to come and given the chance to come again to Baguio, I would still come to Mines View Park and do what I did.Visit the Park if you can! It's worth your time and energy."
Mines View Observation Deck,As usual. You‚Äôve got a nice view here if the weather permits you because sometimes the fog eats the view. Never the less it‚Äôs so relaxing and there are stalls where you can buy your pasalubongs as well. You just have to pay a small amount for you to enter the place but it‚Äôs worth it.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Gives a nice view of the mountains. Can get too crowded though, since tourists are not limited even in this time of the pandemic. Nice place to buy plants or get a quick bite too."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Observation Deck is indeed a breathtaking view. Despite the sun shining bright, it was only warm and not very hot.‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüëèThe parking area here is limited but the locals guide you to places where one can park. We parked right infront of a gated place to which they reassured us that it will be fine. It was not a paid parking but we provided tip.üòäThere are also a lot of places to buy pasalubong around here. You may check out as you walk to outside.üëèüëè............."
Mines View Observation Deck,There are many other good places you can visit on the ways most stunning views will see on road side if you are going by your own vehicle. This just a small place where from you can see one mountain that's all I didn't find anything interesting there. If you are going to botenical garden then Mines View is 3km from there
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great view of the mountain range. Unfortunately some are covered by houses, unlike before when Baguio was not that crowded. Lots of souvenirs to buy. They even sell a variety of plants in the area."
Mines View Observation Deck,Who would want to miss the Mines View Deck in Baguio City? I think most tourists visiting Baguio would not miss out this spot on their itinerary. You also get to taste the local delicacies & Filipino street foods here.
Mines View Observation Deck,The view was stunning. People liked lining up for picture taking dressed like the one on my image and they are enjoying how beautiful the nature is. The warm sun didn‚Äôt bother us because we feel the warmth as a relief from the city life we had.Baguio has a place in our heart and we will be back again.
Baguio City Market,Philippine bazaar market at its best. I mean when you want a merchandise you have 50 little merchants who want your business. This place is old but its character is pleasing. Every ones very nice. Haggling is encouraged.
Baguio City Market,"Place is clean and well-maintained.With good police visibility, which was good as you feel secured. Vendors are organized and helpful.This is place is nostalgic, nothing much had changed since I last went here years ago."
Baguio City Market,"Always visit the market for vegetables and pasalubong shopping. Bring your own tote bag. Ask around for the best price, you will always find the lowest price towards the middle of the market."
Baguio City Market,"Clean as ever... But you have to be wiser when buying... You have to canvas, haggle price and still check whatever you bought if it's complete, just that you don't have to go back there to pick up what's missing. üòÅüòÄ"
Baguio City Market,Mahal na  ang presyo.  Look  at  different  sellers  because  the  difference  in price   go  up  to as much as 100 pesos.  Fruits and veggies  fairly priced. The   sweets and  pasalubongs really differ per stall.Best  buy  are the  yarns! Comes in all colors  and variants  
Baguio City Market,"I visited Baguio Market on weekdays so I am not really sure if its crowded every weekend. Their pasalubongs are all cheap in price. Sweets, walis tambo, tshirts, seafoods and etc. You may choose this place for pasabulongs and souvenir if you dont want to visit the good shepherd since its a bit pricey."
Baguio City Market,"if you are to buy pasalubong, here is the place to be, the area is complete of all sorts of pasalubong, from baguio's famous walis, strawberry jam, ube jam, peanut brittle etc"
Baguio City Market,"Nice market, very organize and clean esp. on the fruit seller area."
Baguio City Market,"You should never miss the market when visiting Baguio City. Love the coffee, took me almost 1hr! Its clean. Follow the traffic signs, Loading/Unloading road side."
Baguio City Market,Lots of options to see and choose from. Great value for money. This is my favorite market in the country because it's so clean and orderly.
Baguio Night Market,"Baguio Night Market is one of the best and unforgettable experiences. You have to be earlier before 9pm, that's the exciting part! cause you will see how they organize the apparel and a lot more.   You can buy a lot of branded jackets, sweatshirts and more at a cheaper price plus discounts if you know how to ask. After shopping there is a wide selection of food and drinks just a few steps beside the market. Never missed this experience if you visit Baguio City üòä"
Baguio Night Market,"They have a lot of stuff they are selling from thrift clothes down to phone cases and a lot more. As for the food, a lot to choice from like corn, barbecue,takoyaki and many more. There were a lot of people when i went there too. But it is fun to look around, buy some stuff and eat."
Baguio Night Market,"We had to wait until 9pm before the sale started proper. So amazing how all the sellers were so prepared 30 minutes to the start of the market time. The long line of people patiently waiting for both time and their turn. The security guards at the exit gate were so friendly even to remind us that we can't eat outside the market, offered us seat and entertained my friends and I with a lot of international topics. It was really great and fun being there again."
Baguio Night Market,"They started at exactly 9pm and was able to set up quickly. Although it was raining, the store continued. They put covers showing they were prepared. The local police were present but of course, you still have to take care of your belongings.PS. Photos taken using film cam"
Baguio Night Market,Baguio trip is not complete if you have not experienced the food trip and a little shopping at Baguio Night Market. Family and friends will surely enjoy the cold air outside while eating lots of food variety. Most of the ukay items here are cheaper and are good finds ‚ù§Ô∏è
Baguio Night Market,"Clean and orderly with health protocol reminders in place. Nice place to stroll around to see local market finds but it's disappointing how common souvenir goods' prices are seemingly overpriced (Good Shepherd ube jam was 20 pesos or more cheaper at Mines View Park than here). Convenient to buy though with its central location, but just be aware of potential tourist traps."
Baguio Night Market,prices of commodities are almost the same as of those in thrift shops in provinces. the place is very crowded at night and since it is near the burnham park you could see lots of people strolling at night. tourists need to be careful of their personal belongings
Baguio Night Market,"This is an interesting sales venue/event. We got there at about 8:45. The sidewalks were packed and the vendors were ready with their goods on the side of the street. At 8:55, they all extended the poles on their portable shelters. At 9pm sharp, game on. Vendors rushed to erect their shelters and set up their wares with impressive efficiency. Within just a few minutes,  the shopping looked like a feeding frenzy on Shark Week. It is crazy how this can go from a busy street with heavy traffic to a busy shopping area with people elbow to elbow, all in just about 5 minutes."
Baguio Night Market,"Lots of choices to buy from clothes, jackets, souvenir items, shoes and more. Enforcement of one-way policy can be improved as well as police visibility so as to avoid snatchers."
Baguio Night Market,"Sellers will begin setting up at at 7pm or 8pm but they will only start selling at 9PM. Food selections include favorite Filipino food such as Sisig, Pares, grilled and fried meat, corn, Balut, Kwek-Kwek, and many more. There are also sellers of Takoyaki, Shawarma, Korean Street Food such as Tteokbokki and more.On another side of the night market are stores for favorite Baguio souvenirs such as keychains, magnets, shirts, jackets, knitted sweaters and scarfs by locals, and other things to buy. Some items are pricier than in other souvenir stores in other tourist places. Prepare to walk through a long line of options."
Wright Park,"‚Ç±250/30minutes to ride a horse with a guide is not bad at all. The kids loved it. The guide was courteous, Kuya Rolly. The stroll around The Mansion and the mirror pool was my fave. The area had bike lanes and the paid restroom area had a landscaped zen like garden and was so clean. The whole area was clean and the lark was well kept. The pool had fishes on it. A few meters walk down towards botanical was a steak place you can wind down on, they have . Pine Country Steaks and Waffles! Highly recommended!"
Wright Park,Never fails to be mesmerizing. It's my 5th time to be here and I still enjoy going here. Nice to help local tourist spot and help boost their economy. Specially the ones that are striving to for it. If you love nature come here. But make sure it's the weekdays because weekends produce the most populous days to travel.
Wright Park,Part of Wright Park is under renovation. Love the view of many horses big and small. Also appreciate the efforts and presence of vendors around the park for more convenient tour. A thirty minute horseback riding is worth P300.
Wright Park,"When I was 8 yrs old we went to Baguio for a trip with my family. I wanted my child to have the same experiences and memories. Wright Park had more flowers more than 20 yrs ago. It was more beautiful. Now, even the trees are sparse and the water looks like its extremely murky. Nonetheless, I hope my boy holds these memories as precious as I hold my memories of Baguio when I was young."
Wright Park,"It is less crowded during the pandemic so we get to enjoy the park more.Great place to pass time, unwind and just to enjoy the beautiful scenery."
Wright Park,"This is where people visit for a horseback riding. As expected, there are many horses available but most of them seem unwell so we didn't tried to ride one. We just let the kid to experience it. They offer photo op with the horse and you just have to pay 50 pesos. The smell is quite not nice but understandable."
Wright Park,Nostalgic. Wright park is divided into 2. Upper and lower. The lower part is the horse backriding. The ride is 250/ 30minutes. I recommend camp john Hay if you want to horse backride because the space is limitedThe upper part is great. It is just across the Mansion. Make sure to take a photo at the long pond/reflection
Wright Park,"Ig worthy place. The fishes are cute, they all stop moving for a while. It's nice to take pictures here and also just a very refreshing place to explore. Bring a thicker mask or handkerchief because it stinks in the horse-riding area."
Wright Park,Kids enjoyed riding a horse around the city. P500/ head. Plus tip to your kuya tour guide. üòâ
Wright Park,My kids enjoyed their time on top of their horses. We were the only one's in the park and we loves it.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"One of the best gardens I visited. This place  is Eden-like cozy version. If you are dreaming of going to Denmark or Amsterdam or any European countries but on a very tight budget, this is a good alternative.The place is clean, the flowers are beautiful. The ambiance of the place is relaxing. There are food stalls too where you can just sit, eat, relax, stroll and repeat.This is also a good place to propose!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Marvel at the best landscape architectural project I have ever seen. Don't be fooled by it's name this isn't your typical plant based attraction.This place will be very hard to explain in words so it is best if you see it in personal. It has different cultural gardens. It has a great play with elevation. It has tunnels it has great paid comfort room that brings you deep inside the rain forest. But most importantly, it has a coffee shop situated perfectly to feast your eyes with a view."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"For entrance fee of just 10 pesos, you can spend time with your friends and family in this beautiful and newly renovated garden. Go on a weekday if you can to avoid the crowd. There is a milk tea stall in the middle of the park if you want refreshments, and a cafe near the entrance. Take time to see the cacti collection. Restrooms are clean. Highly recommended to both locals and tourists."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"This is a beautiful place to visit if your staying a few days in Baguio. I saw so many different varieties of flowers and plants, that I hadn‚Äôt ever seen before. There were a lot of people here so be patient you will get your turn to view. Also there is a very low admission fee. Your camera‚Äôs are going to enjoy this location."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Newly improved botanical garden. With improved ambiance. When you want to shoot or pictorial you need a permit @ the entrance. Don not worry for your safety there are guards roaming around. Also restrooms are within the vicinity, you need to pay for maintenance aside from the entrance fee. Enjoy the view!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I visited Baguio Botanical Garden twice already. My first time was in June 24, 2022, then second time was on my birthday August 4, 2022. They have an entrance fee of 10.00 pesos only. It's worth it, beyond worth it. I enjoy visiting this place. It's like everytime you visit, you still discover something new in the place. You got to experience different ambiance as they have Japanese Garden, Korean Garden and lot more. You can see lots of plants, flowers and succulents which I love. You can discover new species of plants that you do not usually or rarely see in your own place. If you go to Baguio, I recommend this place for you to visit. If I go to Baguio for the third time, I will definitely visit the Baguio Botanical Garden again."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It's good to be back here after a decade and I liked that they have developed this place. You only need to pay P10 entrance fee which is very cheap. The rest room is very clean and spacious. There are lots of beautiful spots for picture taking but expect to share the place with lots of tourists. All in all, it's a very relaxing place worth visiting when you're in Baguio."
Baguio Botanical Garden,great place with a beautiful scenery!! if you like to walk and just admire the surroudings then this is for you! The best thing would be that the entrance fee is only 10 pesos yer you get to see a great view! Tables are also available around so I guess you can bring food for snacks there but there is also a cart inside that sells coffee.
Baguio Botanical Garden,One of the newest open attraction in Baguio after two years of closed because of pandemic.They made a lot of changes in their landscaping. It looks more beautiful now than before.Just visit and see the new scenery.
Baguio Botanical Garden,There was a 10 pesos entrance fee per person. Super nice place to walk around specially if you are into plants. The park has different sections that have their own themes. Be prepared to walk and climb stairs though
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"The Baguio Cathedral is in the center of the city, just along session road. You have to climb up the famous stiff stairs but you have an option to go the other way. The Cathedral itself is huge and it's amazing as it's well maintained church though there's a lot of people going to mass. There's a Chapel that you can go to if you want a more secluded area and more peace."
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"The Baguio Cathedral is right at the center of the city. You can reach it via taxi, Grab or just follow google while driving.Parking spaces are available but you will be charged per hour. There is a ticket upon entering and they‚Äôll charge you at the exit.There is also a food court but it was closed during our visit. Restrooms have minimal charge but are clean.When we got there, we were lucky to have heard mass and see and touch the Black Nazarene visiting Baguio."
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,Well maintained church. You have to climb up the famous steep stairs or you have an option to take the other way which is easier option if you are not willing to put some leg work. Very peaceful ambiance.
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"This church is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Baguio. We went here on a weekday. Hence, there are no crowds, and we were able to pray in peace and silence. If you want to hear Mass, go early since it is always packed with crowds especially during Sundays. There is a pay parking area in the front courtyard. As in any church in the Philippines, services are held in Filipino and English."
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,One of the famous and historical landmarks in baguio. Located @ the heart of Baguio City. A very solemn and peaceful ambiance. A must visit specially for Roman Catholic.
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"We attended the mass around 5pm. After the said mass, we were greeted with an thick fog outside.  Happy to be back again Baguio"
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"Our Lady of Atonement Cathedral / Baguio CathedralOur Lady of Atonement Cathedral which is popularly known as Baguio Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral which was constructed in 1920 and got finished 1936.  It got its name from one of the titles given to Mary mother of Jesus. This church has a simple but elegant facade which (was) pink in color with rose style windows. It is located on top of Mount Mary Hill where visitors can access it using hundred steps stoneMy side story:I originally planned to come here after my appointment(Nov 4, 2021) at the Nationwide Health Systems Baguio Inc. but had to got to Triage first to secure a health certificate. God must have wanted me to go for adoration time before anything else bc there was surprisingly enormous surge of people at the place and each priority number takes a while to get accommodated on the counter. At that time they just called out for #26 and I got #56 on the line and was growing anxious waiting with the uncertain time I have left so i hopped in a cab and went to this beautiful city cathedral. The cathedral was like 5-10mins away from Triage so i figured I can spend a little more time there after saying my prayers. By the way, the cathedral is currently on renovation so I just managed to take a few photos inside and prayed at the Face of Jesus mini chapel located at the back of the cathedral. After 30mins, decided to go back to Triage and arrived just in time! My PN was called in within 5 mins! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èAs to my experience, Baguio Cathedral is a great place for spiritual reawakening! Try to visit and see why I said so üòâ I truly feel blessed for being able to visit and spend some prayer time here. My prayers were actually half answered by the time I stepped out of the clinic(my appointment in Baguio). Baguio Cathedral is a new addition to my favorite places ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚ù§Ô∏è"
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,No visit to Baguio should be complete without a visit to this church. Right in the heart of rhe city accessible from The famous Session road
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"Love that they are masses every 30mins in the morning. It's a great first stop and start to any day.Upside: it's adjacent to, and accessible via, Porta Vaga, and via Session Road. There's enough parking spaces if you're driving. The interior has been preserved and the exterior is much cleaner now. It's near SM, Session Road, etc. Very convenient.Downside: it's quite a climb but there are PWD  rails and walkways at the front (main) entrance.Do we recommend this place? YesAre we going back? Yes"
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,A perfect place to offer your prayers. One of the recommended locations for you to visit even when your not religious. This church is one of the longest standing place of worship and its also near session road so it's easy to access. Great for photo opts as well with your friends or loveones. Has alot of parking space so no hassles for those travelling by car.Kindly give a LIKE üëç if this helps!Follow ME for my other REVIEWS!
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The strawberry farm was more organized now than the last time we visited. There is a huge parking space, restrooms are also available and garbage bins. The vendors are all on the side and their food maybe affordable but not very good quality. Hope they improve on this.The farm itself has been closed to the public and we were only able to close up to the gates. Despite it being closed to the public, I think this improved the farm by maximizing the space: putting lettuce below and strawberry on top (see last photo).It was fine for me that the public cannot pick strawberries for tourist purpose because it made a healthier growing environment for the strawberries. Hope people will support this so we can improve the quality of the PH Strawberry."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,This is one of the go-to places when visiting Baguio City. You can buy fresh strawberries here at an affordable price. The vendors are really nice and funny. They sell strawberry flavored ice cream and taho which is a must try! The place is very scenic as well.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"When we decided to go to this strawberry farm we wanted to make sure we will be allowed to pick our own strawberries, we checked with hotel staffs in holiday Inn, taxi drivers we rode in past 2days, vendors in local market nobody was sure if the strawberry season was still on (May 22). No phone number to call and check if we will be still allowed to pick our own strawberries. We arrived at the farm and it is a huge disappointed, Place is full of mud (make sure you are not wearing your favourite shoes), garages, discarded veggies everywhere. Walked half way in mud only to be told there is no starberries and have to go to the other enterance and try our luck there. Picking strawberries is expensive than buying from the store nearby. (Paint my fence and see how fun it is). Overall it feels more like a tourist trap. Good for Instagram influencers."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Good for shopping, not much for sightseeing or experience. Entrance fee of 10 pesos into the farms, but nothing much to see inside, and with all the strawberries harvested, there's no strawberry picking. Even the lettuce planted in this place can't be picked. But you can buy the purple and green lettuce at 50 pesos per stalk.Large strawberry farm with different owners separated by fences. It's a proper farm with workers going to and fro with their vegetable. You can take pictures here, but most spots aren't picture worthy, just take a random view.The area sells lots of goods not limited to strawberry. Vegetables are quite cheap here compared to NCR, so if you have the space or a fridge to put your haul later on, it's the best way to spend in this spot.There's a wide collection of fruit wines from strawberry, blueberry, mangosteen, Bugnay, etc, at 200 to 250 pesos per bottle, very nice. There's also a strange snake wine with aphrodisiac components for the daring, as the seller said it can also strengthen the bone. Strawberry here are sold at 150-200 per pack of about 1/4 to 1/2 kg, a little cheaper compared to other spots in Baguio that sell strawberries at 250 pesos for less the weight.There are a few canteen style lunch options, the drinks are pricey, and there's no service water or soup to go with the meals,.be prepared to pay about 180 pesos to 500 pesos for canteen style meals.There are other odd wooden toys and items for sale in this place, and strawberry taho and strawberry ice cream (the ice shaved type) here, and lots of parking space. It's a hotspot for people into buying things. Shopping is the norm here, you'll enjoy if you brought cash. Selected vendors accept GCash too, just ask them."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Went here to pick some strawberries but unfortunately it's not yet harvest season. Nice place to buy pasalubong and of course strawberries. There were a lot of stall to choose from. Be ready to bargain so you can get big discount.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"I'm not really fond of strawberries but the ones I had in the farm and pasalubong center were good. The strawberry shakes were good, too. There were a lot of shops to buy from."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The scenery is just that great and you can buy cheaper priced strawberry goods and vegetables.Avoid fixed taxi fare coz there are passing taxis here and you won't be stranded. The fare here is like less than 200 pesos from Genesis bus terminal if no heavy traffic, but if fixed you might get charged of 600 back and forth."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"This was quite a fun experience for us. The municipality of baguio is really strict when it comes to tourists coming from neighboring towns especially to ones who came from metro-manila NCR region. Nevertheless it was a compelling assurance that the people we get in touch with are uninfected or at least vaccinated. My group had so much fun with the different products the people has showcased. What gave us more excitement was the fact that we can actually pick our own strawberry fruits. It was not an everyday experience so for us, it was rare and really special. Hope to visit the place again. The people are also very kind which made it more friendly environment. The restaurant we ate with, gave us free vegetables to take home with us. We really appreciate our time here. Thank you so much la trinidad, strawberry farm!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"They have different varieties of pasalubong/take away treats to offer. From fresh fruits and vegetables, to the sweet and satisfying jams and other delicacy. They also sell souvenirs like Baguio printed shirts, keychains, broom, carved wood items, ref magnets and many more."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"So enjoyable, strawberrys are so delicious, fresh and so refreshing. I had taho strawberry and smoothie , Super sarap.There are great selections of vegetables, ornamental plants and herbs , just right for your culinary needs. Highly recommended"
Lion‚Äôs Head,"One of iconic tourist spots of Baguio that you shouldn't miss.During pandemic, it is recommended to strike a deal with your taxi driver to go to and fro here, coz the passing public vehicles are limited.It is not crowded during pandemic compared to before."
Lion‚Äôs Head,This is always a worthy stop-over. Everyone should pay homage to this post-modern structure for a bathroom break or a taste of that home-made strawberry ice-cream or to just take a snap of the big lion which i do all the time.
Lion‚Äôs Head,"It is quite far from the city. And as of August 2022 (during our visit) limited people are allowed in the area since the Kennon is no longer used as way going down to Manila.We were the only tourist during our visit, so you do not have to wait that long to take photos"
Lion‚Äôs Head,"The Lion'S Head:One of the most iconic tourist attraction in Baguio that you shouldn't miss! It's along Kennon Road and it's a landmark when entering Baguio City! It's free for all so have fun taking a selfie or groupies with the the beautiful sculpture made of limestone.üëâ PS: You may watch, like, comment and SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel üòò"" Arlene Aces """
Lion‚Äôs Head,This is a marker thst tells you that you are now entering baguio city. Enjoy take some pictures and have some fun. Just make sure to clean up your mess once you start again. Better yet just tale many pictures as you can. Make as many momories as you can. And leave nothing but foot print no trash.
Lion‚Äôs Head,Good experience. We're lucky that Kennon road already opened after the earthquake incident this July 2022. None much are affected in Baguio.

Lion‚Äôs Head,One of the iconic and most visited tourist spots in Baguio. One can say that you should visit this place when you go to Baguio.There were a lot of people when we visited. There were also taho and ice cream vendors.
BenCab Museum,"Very nice museum. I enjoyed seeing arts plus a good view of a hill and trees in one of the veranda of the museum. If you're already hungry, you can order a snack at their Cafe Isabel located at the ground floor of the building. ‚Ä¶More"
BenCab Museum,Really glad to have finally visited this place. I wouldn't wonder why sir Ben Cabrera is a National Artist. His works are magnificent and his taste on art is impeccable. Really glad the place has expanded so you get to enjoy and appreciate different types and media of art. Totally worth the time and effort. ‚Ä¶More
BenCab Museum,"We bought an entrance ticket for 150pesos each. If you are fond of paintings, you can enjoy this place. If you want to eat in the restaurant inside the museum, make sure to bring enough money because 1 meal cost around 200pesos. When I asked the cashier how much is the bottled water, she didn't answer me. That's why I gave 4 starsüòÖ By the way, the bottled water cost 60pesos eachüòÅ"
BenCab Museum,It looks so good inside the museum. Taking videos and pictures with flash is not allowed though.It's also hard to get a taxi/grab there so I recommend that you bring your own car.
BenCab Museum,Must see when in Baguio for those in the art scene. They also have good cafe restaurant. Allocate a full day to tour the place and enjoy the experience the artist has brought to his guests.
BenCab Museum,"Interesting collection. I did really like some of the paintings. The view outside is also beautiful. There is a cafe at the lowest floor, will definitely try it next time."
BenCab Museum,BenCab Museum is a great place especially for art lovers like me. It houses several galleries of different artists and exhibits and a nice place for venue shows. It also has a nice caf√© and beautiful farm and garden below the premises.‚Ä¢ Parking Space: Ample‚Ä¢ Staff: Super Friendly and Nice‚Ä¢ General Admission: ‚Ç±150They are open Tuesdays to Sundays at 9AM to 6PM. Last entry for the museum is at 5:30 PM.PS: Make sure not to touch the artworks! üôÇ
BenCab Museum,"This museum is very informative and of course beautiful and meaningful paintings. It has a cafe and something like mini pond that has ducks and fish which you can feed (can be bought from cafe) them. There is also a souveneir shop. Overall, it has a nice view and very calmly ‚ù§Entrance Fee? Yes. Php150 per personCafe food price? Ranges from Php100 to Php300"
BenCab Museum,"If you are into art or just want to take artsy or hashtag cultured photos. You must visit Bencab! For only 150pesos you can enjoy various paintings from BenCab himself and other local artists.After touring around the museum and immersing yourself in art. You can take a seat on their caf√© and order a food. The food tastes so good!! Actually, no restaurant or cafe failed me in Baguio!"
BenCab Museum,"This place is awesome. The main highlight of my Baguio trip. It features tributes to the work and life of the National Artist Benedicto Cabrera as well as highlights the history of his art. Also displayed are relics from the natives of the area.You can spend hours immersed in it all and afterwards relax and recharge at the cafe and garden at the lower deck. A bit pricey but of course taking it all in with the view makes every bite worth it. Had pares, bulalo, and basil pasta. Will definitely come back the next time we visit Baguio."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This place is a aesthetically pleasing for people who have brave hearts. Well, I mean, you know the history. The air near the hotel is somewhat heavy for me and my other friends. But the place as I said is beautiful.I just hope their souls rest in peace and don't mind the visitorsüôÉüôÇü§û"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Last time I went here was October 2019, where you can still go inside the building and climb up to the roof top. As you go inside, you‚Äôll get that eerie feeling. There‚Äôs a fountain in the middle part where it feels so classic and vintage.Now, It‚Äôs 2022 and I went back with my partner. Tourists are no longer allowed to go inside due to the falling debris inside the building and for safety measures. You can still take pictures outside and within the premises. They now have an entrance fee of Php10.00 per head. They are only open up until 5pmFollow to catch up with me and my reviews! ‚úàÔ∏è"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place was a bit crowded when we went in last March 20, 2022. Probably because it's the weekend and the restrictions were lifted. The place kinda gives you a creep but we find it amusing and amazing at the same time. The view is very calming as well and it's nice to take picture almost everywhere. Too bad we cannot go inside anymore not the same as 3 or 4 years ago. Overall we'd love to go back here when it's not that crowded anymore."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Simple and looks like it's ravaged by war kind of ambiance from the movies. Quick visit. Really old style preserved and only the fa√ßade is allowed for pics, can't get in due to renovation. There's entrance of 10 pesos for this outdoor pic. There's a garden nearby to unwind after if you like pine trees.This spot also has snack sellers, a place where you can take a break indeed.If you like old and dated, this is someplace to consider passing-by. Only, it's tough to get a solo pic at lunch time with lots of passers, so come early."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Wanna get spooked?Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden is the new name, Dominican Hill Retreat House as referred to before, to me it is Diplomat Hotel. Diplomat Hotel as it is called in the many TV shows that featured this edifice will scare you for the many elements that live in it.Did we get the vibe? Make a guess.We went here on a rainy afternoon. The rain beat us badly, we got wet. Thanks to the umbrellas that we have, it didn't soak us.Approaching the place made me think twice. I am skittish, jumpy, high-strung, even neurotic sometimes despite having so many horror books I have in my room or no matter how many hundreds of thriller-horror movies I already have watched and ghostly experiences I dealt with years back. So, I almost backed out but I did not. Thanks to my friends who laughed at me.We arrived a little past 5 pm. We paid for the entrance fee and waited patiently for our turn to have our picture taken in every part outside the hotel. Yes, outside the hotel. It is in renovation these days that we can only have a glimpse of this famous structure from the outside.Should I be thankful for that? Well, I guess not very because my heart secretly wanted to get in.Anyway, we meandered in the place for the remaining daylight there is and took photos of whatever we can. We went through a path in the garden and posed many many times for the camera for a souvenir that we braved the Diplomat Hotel. Hey, we loved the pictures by the garden. Braved if you can call it that way. Hey, we loved the pictures taken by the garden. It looked like from a fairy tale land.As for the spooks? Sorry, we didn't experience such. We're outside the building.We'll just go back sometime in the future to get this vibe."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It‚Äôs been a decade before i went back here. More clean and many people becoming more interested in the place. But they don‚Äôt allow people enter the building maybe for safety purposes. I still amazed and grateful to be back    
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Hunted mansion but still very unique. Paid entrance fee of Php10.00. At first glance of the mansion, it looked scary.  It‚Äôs abandoned mansion with some horrifying stories. It has garden at the back and with a nice view of the community and there is another garden with paved walked way adjacent to the front of the mansion is a garden."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Quiet place for prayer but they were cutting trees when we visited. First time buying their Angel Cookies. Sweet but I liked them.There's a small place for candle lighting.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We visited  this place, yet they restricted  you to enter the main hotel due after the earthquake  because  the building  is quite old , and for the safety for all..Entrace fee is 10 pesos for adult and 5 for kids.Operated  by the lgu so quite reasonableOld building full of history.üòÉ üëß my pay, my say  üòä"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It was sooo foggy when we got there around 4pm, feeling you are really in a hunted place üò±. Tourist are no longer allowed inside the building because of the falling debris, but you can take pictures outside of the eerie old building. It was constructed in 1913. You have to pay P10. entrance fee per head and closes at 5pm. You can take your best OOTD as the outside building facade is soo vintage and very beautiful but just be aware there might be a ghost or white lady behind you ü§™üòÇ‚úåÔ∏èüëâ PS: You may watch, like, comment and SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel üòò"" Arlene Aces """
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Interesting to look at, challenging to finish looking at unless you're used to trekking. There's much walking and climbing on both left and right sides, and it's not suitable for seniors. The angle of inclination for its slope appears to be retained as is that's why it's tough.The left side from the entrance uses a lot of stones and looks rural while the right side has lesser stones and is like a western-inspired castle exterior. If you choose the left side first, you'd get tired, so better to choose the right side first. It's the side with proper stairs and the tunnel with stones painted like gold. The statues on this side look nice.The left side has a way of sparking your imagination. There are also references to Philippine folklore on this side especially on the gods.What's bothered me on the stone side was the lack of safety precautions in the area. The fence is barely there and is quite flimsy, the stair stone steps tiny, and if you slip, that's a super long way down!This left side has the Igorot costume fitting for a fee of 50 pesos for pictorial and several good photo spots for the view.They also have official photographers in the area who print the photo for a fee of 250 pesos when we came to ask.It's worth a visit, but do take your time, it can't be climbed and finished so quickly if you're easily tired. Rushing this place would spoil the experience."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It was my first time here and I think it's a really nice place. It's great to see this amazing stone temple giving people some bits of history about the Igorot tribe. Good for picture taking but you must be brave enough to climb to the top to appreciate this beautiful picturesque.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I personally admired the effort put into constructing this kingdom of stone. They deserve the visit. We really enjoyed taking photos of the stone structures that appear like stair-like terraces. It gives you a glimpse of history of the Igorot communities. With the actual houses and garden, this is a must see!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The spot is still developing as it was made during pandemic. Some parts of it were not yet finished, workers are seen while visitors are in. The rate per person is 100 pesos. I think it‚Äôs a bit pricey but, it‚Äôs understandable as it is a privately owned tourist spot."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Entrance fee is Php100. Pretty crowded during the mid of the day. Great place to do a  hike.  A good place for photography because of it‚Äôs unique structure and architecture. After a 30-minute to an 1 -hour of walking, some variety of storesare available outside the kingdom for snack and drinks. A comfy pair of  shoes are advisable because there‚Äôs a lot of walking/hiking to see the other unique parts of the kingdom."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"View is beautiful. It is a stone throw tourist attraction from our relative's house so we went there as early as 7AM. Because the place gets packed by 8AM onwards, especially on holidays and weekends. Good for picture taking and learning bits about Igorot History. Entrance fee as of May 2022 is 100.00 per person. Parking space is a bit tight but there are few pay parking around. Transient houses are available near the area, too. Best to go as early as 6:30 AM so the place do not have much people yet."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Such an amazing sight to see! This place is built from stone, by hand I was told. I can‚Äôt imagine the time and hard work put into this location. This is a must see in Baguio if you have the opportunity. We stayed a couple of hours here and took some wonder pictures. Even as crowed as it was, people were polite and very patient. I would love to revisit here if I come back to Baguio."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Open, but few areas still under construction. Good to visit in the morning sunrise. Good for pictures but the same stone background everywhere just different structures.Few shaded areas and amenities."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A beautiful and a must visit place when you go to Baguio City. Kids and adults will surely love this place. Not advisable for senior citezens though especially to those who have difficulty walking  and climbing up and down the stairs. The place is not fully finished yet.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A very beautiful place. It gets too busy on weekends, rain or shine. I hope in they control the flow of people inside and remove the shops/stores from the highlight spots.Nevertheless, I will definitely come back."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Great scenery. You just have to prepare yourself for a long queue in getting inside. Prepare your vaccination card and P125 entrance fee for adult. Discounts are given to kids and senior citizens. Wear shoes when planning to go here and umbrella for a surprise rain. Traffic is expected during peak hours/season
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"It was raining when we went here, you‚Äôll really feel like it was like winter. It is advisable to go here around 4pm so you can have a good spot for parking.ENTRANCE FEE10:00 AM - 4:59 PMAdult - 90Kids (4-12 years old) -30Senior Citizen (60 years old and above) -50Presentation of Senior Citizen ID is required5:00PM-10:00PMAdult - 125Kids (4-12 years old) -50Senior Citizen (60 years old and above) -90Presentation of Senior Citizen ID is required"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The price is 250 pesos for adult and 150 pesos for kids. Not the best experience because you will have to stay in long lines as you can see in the picture. The organizers will make a lot profit for this because as I can count from the time that we were there, that number maybe around 500+.Visit this place during weekdays and never on weekends.Limited  parking space.Accommodating staff.Great lightings."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Pros: The place is beautiful, must visit in the evening to see the colorful lights.Cons: The place is too small, a little bit of disappointment because the entrance fee is too pricey for 90 pesos.Note: Bawal ang naka slipper so make sure to wear shoes and bring your vaccination card."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Place might be overrated due to social media, but a must experience. Lines can get long waiting up to 1hr during its peak hours, while you'll be spending less than 15 mins inside (P 125 entrance fee). Slippers are supposedly not allowed inside, but its'nt slippery so no worries. The place is quite small and can easily get cramped so wearing a mask is necessary. However there is something magical about this place that is truly worth the wait."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"It's relatively small. The December 2021 version showcased a short skit of the Nativity. You can take pictures with the cast. There's also a live band that livens the mood, and 'snow' every regular interval (not good for people wearing slippers and those who are careful with their shoes as it's just foam). Great way to bond with friends and snap pictures. But do not expect a grand scale area, again, it's small and limited."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"(Visited last Nov 15, 2022) We had a great experience at the Baguio Country Club Christmas Village 2022 with a theme: Oriental Winter Wonderland. The area is small, you can literally roam around in about 5-10 mins. You'll would probably stay longer for just enjoying the place, taking pictures, listening to the live band and christmas music, watching the Christmas nativity play (happens every hour if not mistaken), or buying food and drinks at the stalls around. It gets quite crowded fast too, thus the 4 stars. Line Queue buildup starts at around 5:30pm, as Evening is the best time for you to visit this place. Finding a parking space is rough and traffic gets really busy at peak hours. It would be best and more convenient if you just get there via Taxi.See photos and captions."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Very crowded inside and the ""snow"" will surely make your shoes muddy. That's why it's good to follow the rules, wear shoes instead of slippers. Nice attractions though, good for picture taking"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"This place was known as Christmas village. Yet, when the Panagbenga started, they develop this area and design it into a Japanese culture. When you visit here, you will be amazed of the beautiful scenery. You will really feels you are not in Baguio. Just come in visit this place. The landscape won't last long. It will end when the Panagbenga ended also."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"We enjoyed a lot and It's worth the fee. But as far as I know, there is crowd control and a limit on the number of people who must be inside the Christmas village, but when we were there, it seemed like there were so many people inside that you couldn't enjoy the attractions or take a nice photo because of the crowd. Maybe this part needs to be improved. But all and all, the place is beautiful. If you have kids, I recommend that you bring them along - they will really enjoy it.

Bell Church,"A known tourist spot here in Baguio City. If you are a peace and nature loving person, then go to this place. A picturesque mountain side which they turned into a temple. This is along the highway going to La Trinidad Benguet. Nearby tourist spot is the Volley of Colors which is just 3 minutes walk."
Bell Church,"Before you reach the Taoist Temple agte, you'll pass thru the street with shops, you will notice that the Taoist walls were not taken care of. On the temple itself, it's fully renovated, newly painted, and newly trimmed landscape. The view from the lower ground is perfect to take photos of the gazebos with statues. Elders would have difficulty climbing up the ladder since it's stiff. They may just stay at the temple."
Bell Church,"Bell Church is a Buddhist Temple. This place is one of the tourist destination of La Trinidad. Open minded people like me will enjoy here. Aside from the beautiful scenery which will welcome you upon entering this place, you will be amazed of the persons personality inside the church of you are not shy to talk to him. You will gain more knowledge about their religion if you are willing to learn. The key is to ask, then you will find the answer."
Bell Church,"Be respectful, this is still a church. It may not be your religion but it is someone's religion and they hold the place with much reverence the way you would for your own church. So I really dislike that there were tourist that were running around or shouting. We were there late in the afternoon and it was a cloudy day. So there are only few tourists but still, some were loud."
Bell Church,"Close to boundary arc of Baguio and La Trinidad, from Baguio this will be the last right corner with a police station. Place is well maintained, there will be alot of stair climbing for this place as well. On the peak of tourist accessible only location is a sight to behold. As far as Ive observed it seems to be a Chinese temple as there were alot of traces of Chinese characters and items relates to it."
Bell Church,The place is well maintained and they also have a lion dance for visitors to watch. Love also the colors of the temple.
Bell Church,It's a really cool place to spend your time. Just got to be ready with the steep stairs and a lot of climbing.It has a parking for a few cars.
Bell Church,"A hidden gem of Baguio city, Bell Church is a Taoist temple that is known to be one of the most peaceful places in the city. A striking pagoda and beautifully landscaped gardens soothe the soul even before you enter the temple. Bells, dragons and flags welcome you to this Chinese temple that is calmly spiritual and incredibly tranquil. There is even a lotus pond that adds to the beauty of this serene temple."
Bell Church,"Bell Church is a Chinese temple of the Chinese Filipino  located in the Baguio-La Trinidad boundaryNo photo opt inside the temple (church), observe silenceBut photo opt in the whole place is of course mayYou may climb up to the highest tower to have an overlook view not just of the church but the neighborhood and houses on the clip of the mountainMinimal fee per pax and car park: p20Souvenirs are available before the main entrance of the place"
Bell Church,Fine place to go to. Car park is limited. No video or picture taking allowed at the temple.
Good Shepherd Convent,"they open 8:15am until 4pm but it's better to be there earlier, because the gate hasn't opened yet but the queue is long. Also, not all products are available, every day there are different products available gaya ng cookies pero ung ube laging available!"
Good Shepherd Convent,"What‚Äôs the hype about it?  Ube jam made by the convent sisters ( and strawberry jam but sold out at this time) Decided to check out the convent but (apparently) the only thing to do here is buy from their store (which you can also buy outside for additional 100 pesos).  Tip:  buy from the resellers if you see a long queue as they‚Äôre legit Ube and the convent sisters approved their reselling, you get to help the sisters and the small merchants at the same time."
Good Shepherd Convent,"We all know that their products are so good, resellers/scalpers flock the area as early as possible to be able to queue many times. Most products are out of stock as early as 9am, we were just able to buy two 12oz of Ube, ‚Ç±350 each. Resellers sell this for ‚Ç±400 to ‚Ç±500 pesos in the market. They even sell just in the entrance of Good Shepherd, they‚Äôre making a business out of someones business. It is annoying but we can‚Äôt do anything about it. We just don‚Äôt buy from these resellers."
Good Shepherd Convent,"This is where you can get quality ube jam. The only downside is the long lines. If you're in a rush to buy ube jam, you can go to one of the nearby stalls, albeit the price will be a bit higher."
Good Shepherd Convent,"There's a long line for buyers when we went here on Monday, took us roughly 30mins to an hour. They have chairs set to line but there are portions exposed to the sun, hopefully they can organize it better.They only use paper bags since they don't support the use of plastics, they offer P45 ecobag or cartons for big orders only, so better if you bring your own ecobag. Ube jam bottles are not wrapped on papers, its less secured.Product taste and quality-wise, exceptional as ever."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Manage your expectations. In order for the manufacturers to maintain the quality of their products, they have only limited stocks for sale everyday. Hence, buyers should flock the store early in the morning to avoid shortage. When we went there, the strawberry jam was unavailable. Max of 2 bottles of ube jam are allowed per person. Others may be purchased more than 2 perhaps. They also offer other products."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Although there is a long qeue of lines, its stil best to buy your pasalubong, knowing its new or still fresh stocks compared to the market"
Good Shepherd Convent,"Long line, then limited piece per order for snowballs. Imagine a tourist from manila mostly booked in a hotel. Going from the hotel paying almost 200 pesos for the taxi fare finding out that they can buy only 1 pieces of sbowballs? What? You think we dont have families and friends to give pasalubong? Someday It will be your loss."
Good Shepherd Convent,Long line so go here early. They also have a limit on the quantity of items you will buy to discourage reselling.They also have a bdo pos terminal so they can accept debit and credit cards.
Good Shepherd Convent,Good products but it's too haggard to fall in line. Their service is slow.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We started the trekking from butterfly farm and ended up exit via the horse stable which we think it‚Äôs not the exit. Lack of signboard is the issue.Overall the trekking was enjoyable with cool breeze. There should have been some shelters at checkpoint in case it rains. It rains when we were half way trekking, though we have umbrellas but it‚Äôs very chilling."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"My experience? Just had fun taking photos... I didn't knew there's dress code, I was in heels so I wasn't allowed to take any of the rides. The place is so nature, you could smell the pine trees' refreshing aroma. I definitely want to go back and try at least one of the rides! Recommend much!"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We had a nice experience at Tree top. Their staffs are very friendly and helpful. The rides are safe enough, we tried the Canopy ride and the Surfer slide which costs 400 pax for the both rides."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Had a lot of adventure activities to offer. But if your not that adventurous, the 300-meter trek is worth it especially at the end of the walk where the amazing view of Itogon mountains awaits.Must visit destination at Camp John Hay."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Wow what an expirence it was to visit this tree top adventure we had a blast here. There was cable cars/seats to travel along to an observation point a nice gentle ride. With very friendly staff and plenty of saftey equipment. Fast ziplines and trekking. Once you have been here an had an amzing time I recomend heading to the butterfly sanctury for a beautiful hike around the mountains so many breath taking views.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We did 'Trekking and Skywalk' and enjoyed the experience. The required hike was short and easy, and the view from the skywalk was breathtaking. The whole activity lasted us an hour.There is a briefing upon entering the place to inform visitors of the activities on offer and what those activities involve."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,It was the venue for my nephew's wedding and the first time I've been to this part of Baguio City.I'm one of the Filipino people who could be proud of this particular place for any party or get-together or any activity you name it. It's an adorable place which I've witnessed seeing it from top and looking down below I was amazed.I even dreamed of having the place for my party in future in God's will. Just take note of having a good caterer company to cater all your needs and up to your standard then everything will be perfect.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Highly recommended for families and friends bonding who loves adventurous and thrilling rides through ziplines with very beautiful view of tall and giant pine trees in Baguio.  Very good and well maintained facilities, and very courteous staff."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"This place is the best destination for all baguio visitors who are looking for adventure, thrill, excitement and fun.It has many rides supervised by professional and kind staffIt suites adults and kidsAlso it is located in Camp John Hay which is considered as the most popular picnic destination in baguio"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We came here as early as 9am and we've experienced riding the Canopy, Silver Surfer and Superman in priority! Haha We enjoyed the rides, especially the views! It's a nature trip with a twist! üòâüëå Plus, the Packages prices are so much affordable. Best to enjoy in groups (family or friends)."
Valley of Colors,"A new tourist spot in Baguio. An instagramable place just along the high way going to La Trinidad. This spot will not take you about 5 minutes to complete your photoshoot. So when you are visiting this spot, you also try to visit nearby destination like the Bell Church which is just 3 minutes walk away."
Valley of Colors,The concept is actually great. What is remarkable is that this number of private houses agreed to be painted absent their choices of color in order to bring the best of this hill. This may symbolize that unity can achieve greatness. I did not realized such before because maybe this place is very familiar to me as I almost daily passing it by. The place is easily accessible thru La Trinidad Jeepneys. There is no specific parking place but you can park side of the highway.Hope they will repaint it again to bring back how it was once vibrant. The animated photo is not mine (CTTO).
Valley of Colors,"Honestly not worth it. The place has not been maintained. Crowded and there's really no room when several batches of tourist come at once since it's literally along the highway. However, I won't stop you if you really want to experience it. Camera filters are the key. üòâ ‚Ä¶More"
Valley of Colors,"Good photo shots from afar, not nice up close. Crowded residential area painted creatively. If it weren't for the paint, it would be close to a city slum area on a hill. I think it needs improvement to be a safer & scenic tourist spot. The colorful houses have a 10 pesos donation at the space near the entrance that also sells goodies. You can take photos only up to the bridge. Don't go further in because it's a private residential area beyond the bridge.The view still does have a little charm of watching a movie's scene where poor people live. You can see some laundry hanging outside. The ambiance isn't relaxing. There's water under the bridge. The bridge can be shaky, so don't shake it while walking through it. And since it's a private residential area, there's quite a number of passerby and traffic along the bridge since it's not separated.If you just want photos, it's a quick stop. If they improve the traffic by making another bridge path for tourists, then maybe it'll be better. It's hard to take solo pictures while people pass through the bridge after all."
Valley of Colors,Colorful cute houses! The area is still closed but you can still go to the bridge area to take photos. We had this photo taken on our way to Banaue Rice Terraces.
Valley of Colors,Use as a setting for Erich Gonzales famous teleserye The Blood Sisters. Love the vibrancy of the valley!‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Viewüì∏üì∏üì∏üì∏üì∏ - Instagrammableüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä - Enjoyable

Valley of Colors,Great art work! A must visit. More fun in the Philippines!
Valley of Colors,"You have to wait for your moment to get a perfect picture. Few mins walk to bell church. I just hope that the residents show their appreciation for having their place as an attraction- by removing their clothes hanging in their window, just sayin‚Äôü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Valley of Colors,"It's nice, but if you don't stand directly on the foot bridge you capture everything else."
Teacher's Camp,"I love the room so homey and simple but  clean. Beddings super clean also . There is hot and cold  shower. Near of everything resto and restobar convenient store, accessible tp public transpo. Most of all i love the view. We had coffee on the bench while bracing the morning dew and the beautiful sunrise. Difinitely we will go back again."
Teacher's Camp,It has been a nice place to stay when in Baguio. It‚Äôs cheap rates and discounts for government employees are great. Staffs are kind too
Teacher's Camp,"Beautiful place. Conducive learning environment. The weather is cold, a lot of corner and instagrammable spots."
Teacher's Camp,"Stayed here during our 9th PTYC. I enjoyed the view of towering pine trees and relaxing environment, it was a memorable experience."
Teacher's Camp,"I just love the place. Cheap but nice place to stay, esp when youre having vacation  with your family. We stayed in  1 of the guest houses furnished with with sala set, dinning set, refrigerator, kitchen where you can cook if you wish too."
Teacher's Camp,Really had a nice stay here in Baguio for the CMLI Annual Convention. The building we were staying in was newly renovated and secured with CCTV cameras. The rooms were also clean and very spacious. Their bathrooms are one of the most comfortable and clean bathrooms I've seen. This Camp is very big and you can stroll around the place. Very beautiful view and cheap souvenir items.
Teacher's Camp,Super Enjoy!!!! from Bestlink college of the Philippines
Teacher's Camp,"I went here to visit their gardens. Beautiful rows of flowers. Very picturesque. I congratulated the lady gardener and said thank you for what she grows. She gave me a big smile, I know she's proud of her work"
Teacher's Camp,Refreshing air and nature it's good and cold üòÇüòÇ we stay for 2 night and it's very freezing ...
Teacher's Camp,"The place to stay in Baguio for travellers on a budget. They offer rooms mostly with common toilets and baths with hot water. They charge per person and provide toiletries. Friendly caretakers and guards. Facilities need upgrades and improvements, esp. the conference halls and rooms. Many pine trees and cool air but expect air pollution as many vehicles pass through the main road. Discounts for government workers."
