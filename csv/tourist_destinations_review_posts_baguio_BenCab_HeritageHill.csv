BenCab Museum,"Very nice museum. I enjoyed seeing arts plus a good view of a hill and trees in one of the veranda of the museum. If you're already hungry, you can order a snack at their Cafe Isabel located at the ground floor of the building. ‚Ä¶More"
BenCab Museum,Really glad to have finally visited this place. I wouldn't wonder why sir Ben Cabrera is a National Artist. His works are magnificent and his taste on art is impeccable. Really glad the place has expanded so you get to enjoy and appreciate different types and media of art. Totally worth the time and effort. ‚Ä¶More
BenCab Museum,"We bought an entrance ticket for 150pesos each. If you are fond of paintings, you can enjoy this place. If you want to eat in the restaurant inside the museum, make sure to bring enough money because 1 meal cost around 200pesos. When I asked the cashier how much is the bottled water, she didn't answer me. That's why I gave 4 starsüòÖ By the way, the bottled water cost 60pesos eachüòÅ"
BenCab Museum,It looks so good inside the museum. Taking videos and pictures with flash is not allowed though.It's also hard to get a taxi/grab there so I recommend that you bring your own car.
BenCab Museum,Must see when in Baguio for those in the art scene. They also have good cafe restaurant. Allocate a full day to tour the place and enjoy the experience the artist has brought to his guests.
BenCab Museum,"Interesting collection. I did really like some of the paintings. The view outside is also beautiful. There is a cafe at the lowest floor, will definitely try it next time."
BenCab Museum,BenCab Museum is a great place especially for art lovers like me. It houses several galleries of different artists and exhibits and a nice place for venue shows. It also has a nice caf√© and beautiful farm and garden below the premises.‚Ä¢ Parking Space: Ample‚Ä¢ Staff: Super Friendly and Nice‚Ä¢ General Admission: ‚Ç±150They are open Tuesdays to Sundays at 9AM to 6PM.

BenCab Museum,"This museum is very informative and of course beautiful and meaningful paintings. It has a cafe and something like mini pond that has ducks and fish which you can feed (can be bought from cafe) them. There is also a souveneir shop. Overall, it has a nice view and very calmly ‚ù§Entrance Fee? Yes. Php150 per personCafe food price? Ranges from Php100 to Php300"
BenCab Museum,"If you are into art or just want to take artsy or hashtag cultured photos. You must visit Bencab! For only 150pesos you can enjoy various paintings from BenCab himself and other local artists.After touring around the museum and immersing yourself in art. You can take a seat on their caf√© and order a food. The food tastes so good!! Actually, no restaurant or cafe failed me in Baguio!"
BenCab Museum,"This place is awesome. The main highlight of my Baguio trip. It features tributes to the work and life of the National Artist Benedicto Cabrera as well as highlights the history of his art. Also displayed are relics from the natives of the area.You can spend hours immersed in it all and afterwards relax and recharge at the cafe and garden at the lower deck. A bit pricey but of course taking it all in with the view makes every bite worth it. Had pares, bulalo, and basil pasta. Will definitely come back the next time we visit Baguio."
BenCab Museum,"Amazing museum on the outskirts of Baguio City. Extensive collection of beautiful cultural artifacts. The view cannot be understated as well. 10/10, would recommend. ‚Ä¶More"
BenCab Museum,"A trip to Baguio will never be complete without going to this museum. I get that most of the artwork on display are still the same year-in, year-out, save for a gallery that‚Äôs being updated based on who‚Äôs exhibiting. But the sheer pull of BenCab himself, as well as the art he made of the place, with the museum building and then the garden and the ponds, and even the cafe, makes a pilgrimage to it worth it every time."
BenCab Museum,"Lovely museum in stunning grounds, definitely worth visiting if you're in Baguio. All of the art on display, by local artists, is excellent and the space itself is very nice. 150 entrance per adult.There is a cafe on the ground floor and a koi pond and seating area outside. The grounds of the property are huge and very beautiful - you can do an eco tour for an extra 150 per person to explore the grounds."
BenCab Museum,Love the curation of Filipino modern art in different mediums. They have other experiences as well; outdoor nipa hut on the lake and the cafe.Would be better if the front desk lady wasn't rude if you don't have smaller bills.. Also much better if they have gcash payment if they can't give you the change right away.
BenCab Museum,Adequate parking. Friendly staff. Php 150 entrance fee. Discounts available for students and senior citizens. Paintings and sculptures from renowned and upcoming artists. There is a cafe with a great view. Must see when in Baguio.
BenCab Museum,Super awesome... One should not miss visit this super amazing museum. Apart from the beautiful amazing materials in the museum... the outdoor of this museum is jaw-dropping          ‚Ä¶More
BenCab Museum,Nice place to go to.... Nice pieces on display.... View is good....  Took so much photos with my besties.... The staff members are super helpful if you have questions about the art pieces and also helpful in helping us take nice selfies.       
BenCab Museum,"A go-to place whenever I‚Äôm in Baguio. Located at Asin Road. Just took jeepney from terminal near Burnham Park then the jeepney will stop at the Asin Terminal, few minutes walk to BenCab Museum. Entrance fee is around P150 (adult price). A good way to immerse on art and culture of Baguio. There‚Äôs a variety of painting and sculptures. At the ground floor, we dine in at Cafe Sabel - overlooking the garden, pond and mountain view."
BenCab Museum,Love the place. The museum and the outdoor. Saw other pieces aside from BenCab. They have a cafe and a souvenir place. Love how they categorically arranged the pieces.
BenCab Museum,This place is very relaxing! Mr. Cabrera have paintings made by Ang Kiukok in his personal collection. Just wow! I love every corner of this museum and I hope I can purchase one of his paintings soon!
BenCab Museum,nice place to visit when in baguio. the property is located outside the busy streets of the city. offers great views and good food of course the paintings and fine arts collections of the owner. could have been better if the place had elevator for seniors and pwd's
BenCab Museum,Great place for art. Has a cafe inside as well plus the koi pond. Saw that there is debit card/credit card option on the store as well. Quite far but the trip is worth it. P25 via jeepney from Burnham Park
BenCab Museum,"a long ride from baguio city proper, but definitely a MUST VISIT. my boyfriend really enjoyed the personalized mini tour i gave him from the bulol, some of the national artists' works and the current contemporary artists i have met and encountered.we also enjoyed a cheesecake and coffee from Cafe Sabel.the view is üíØ."
BenCab Museum,The place is so beautiful with all the artworks. A must visit for Baguio City visitora.
BenCab Museum,"Very creative artist BenCab. Various works of Art depicting people's life and culture.  Ohhh I love the pond, the garden and nature around. Must see while in town"
BenCab Museum,Amazing view for picture taking around the edge of the mountain. Lots of beautiful art to look at and ponder. Reasonable price of 150 pesos per person as this review is made. $3.50 CAD. Spent a couple hours there including eating at the Cafe. I had the fish and it was tasty. There's 4 floors included with various art and a little pond with ducks outside.
BenCab Museum,Love this place... The whole place showcases Baguio's heart of art.  We enjoyed our afternoon coffee drinks here. Relaxing views because its far from the city proper.We find a hard time finding transpo going back to the city proper at around 5:30pm. Its not accessible by Grab and only few taxi were passing by. You can ride a jeepney back to the city.This is a must go places in baguio...
BenCab Museum,"We came in during the rainy season,so theres not much people around. The place was nice as expected and theres a lot of scenic areas in the garden for selfies and photos. You can also reach the place thru commute jeepney even if you dont have your own car."
BenCab Museum,"Definitely a must see in Baguio.Sharing some photos, but the real artworks are much more awe inspiring.It‚Äôs 4 floors below with a coffee shop at the bottom. If the skies are clear, there‚Äôs a scenic view to match the coffee.The tour is arranged so that you get through all the artworks and talk about it after with coffee.There are feature artists from time to time so there‚Äôs reason to come back and appreciate new art."
BenCab Museum,Much more than a showcase of the artist's work and his collection of artifacts from the region. It's a sanctuary and nature park that visitors to Baguio should not miss.
BenCab Museum,"The place is amazing, except it's not PWD-friendly. There are no ramps, only stairs. The artworks are lovely! We got to eat in the restaurant and the food is so delicious, but pricey. The view is so relaxing as well ‚Ä¶More"
BenCab Museum,Damn what a great collection of paintings. When you think the tour is over your view overlooks a beautiful koi pond garden backed by a mountain wall of trees. The cafe has some pretty awesome eats as well. I highly recommend the strawberry shake. So FRESH! ‚Ä¶More
BenCab Museum,Nice collection and awesome view at the mountain with ponds with koi fish and ducks
BenCab Museum,I'm a lover of art so this place is very close to my heart. The place is spacious and very ideal for long-staring contest with the pieces that adorned the walls of the place. I love that it has an outdoor garden as well as a Koi pond.
BenCab Museum,Good place as it is.  Videos and cameras with flash are not allowed. üòÅ
BenCab Museum,"The place is really a gem. Great contemporary local art and indigenous craft.For¬†art lovers¬†a must visit, some interesting works by Filipino artists covering many different styles.Showcasing beautiful and amazing art pieces. Also, the outdoor landscape is so beautiful..."
BenCab Museum,"Not so crowded, 150 entrance regular, nice artwork ‚Ä¶More"
BenCab Museum,I love arts.. so I enjoyed my visit here even though there was no tour guide but I enjoyed my tour by myself. Beautiful scenery‚Ä¶
BenCab Museum,"Wonderful works of art are displayed all over the museum. If you're planning to bring your kids, you might not enjoy the museum that much. Don't hesitate to avail of the eco trail to maximize your visit. ‚Ä¶More"
BenCab Museum,"Location: üåüüåüüåü Quite far from the city. We rode a taxi in going here, but I noticed some jeeps will take the passengers directly in front of the museum.Going out of the area is a different story though. When the jeep passes by the museum, it's already full and not many taxis pass by due to the location. We had to walk maybe a kilometer just to look for a taxi that will take us back to the city (I'm not complaining though because we were able to enjoy some carved wood stuff that the neighboring shops sold).Price: üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Entrance fee is okay considering it is one of the most beautiful museums I have visited.Museuem itself: üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü the way they organized the artworks is what amazes me. From the Igorot artworks to modern artworks, all were so beautiful. It will leave you in awe.The musuem is situated on the mountains and the view is mesmerizing.I will definitely be back with with my family once more.Overall rating: 4.5 out of 5"
BenCab Museum,"Lots of different types of art to look and admire at, with a spectacular nature view."
BenCab Museum,"It's always been a good experience going to Bencab, though it's general admission fee is a bit high. Generally, it's expensive going there since you got to take a cab to and fro the city. It's worth it on a good day, but not on a rainy day. You can't enjoy the garden if you want to.The artworks are awesome, but there's nothing new. I hope there will be more new pieces to see.CafeSabel is nice, except for the prices of food and beverages. But of course, you've got no choice when you're thirsty!"
BenCab Museum,Good for the artsy. Good for the gram! üì∑ Good food at Cafe Sabel! A bit pricy but worth it! Try their baby back ribs & volcano ice cream for the dessert. üç¶
BenCab Museum,The museum itself was full of dry modern art. Not a big admirer of art in general but despite even that i was just not inspired at all. The only thing that saves the place is that they have a nice small pond with koi fish and some ducklings in the back area. ‚Ä¶More
BenCab Museum,"I will NOT go back again. The customer service ruins my experience with the art museum. The personnelles do not¬† know how to greet us back. They don't know how to say simple thank you nor welcome and they are annoyed when being approached. Some of the guest are unruly, kids running around like it's a park, people talking too loud and will crowd you when you walk - no staff close by there to maintain the ""museum"" atmosphere. The comfort room is squalid. Knowing that the guests pay here, the floor is muddy and the toilets have no flush. Also, you taking video is not allowed. You may want to check their facebook reviews too. Better go to National Museum in Manila."
BenCab Museum,"Well, this place is a must see spot when you are exploring Baguio specially when you do love artworks. They also have a cafe for a small bite and some refreshers. You may also be amaze with the scenery and calmness of the landscape."
BenCab Museum,"Very interesting museum, it features the rich culture of the Igorot too. A must visit in Baguioü§©"
BenCab Museum,The location of this art museum is quite far from the city but it‚Äôs still worth the long drive. Not just for art lovers but also for people who appreciate nature or both. Entrance fees are paid at the reception area. They have several sections of paintings and sculptures showcasing local talents. BenCab has several nice masterpieces in oil and canvas. It has a coffee shop inside the museum. You can also have a guided tour along the trails for those who‚Äôre nature lovers. Very nice location for a museum.
BenCab Museum,"This is a must visit place. There are a lot of art works to see. They have different collections - paintings, sculptures, etc. There is also a small resto and their food is delicious and tasty. You can also enjoy the scenic place and take lots of photos except for some restricted areas in the museum."
BenCab Museum,"As a Baguio Resident, I can confidently say that this place is a must if you're visiting Baguio City. Just around 30mins or less from the city center you could enjoy this superb place full of solid beautiful local art and the museum itself gives a world class vibe. It also has a cafe inside, no need to worry if you get hungry specially that you need energy and time to fully explore the area. An eco park is also located inside the premises where in an eco trail tour is also available upon request (tour inside are also available). This place is truly worth the visit, staff are very accommodating too. A gem near Baguio. . . fascinating üëç"
BenCab Museum,Place is nice but crews not so .. ‚Ä¶More
BenCab Museum,we go here not only for the artworks but mostly for the coffee shop at the basement of the museum. nice and relaxing view of the garden and ponds. pretty good food selections also.
BenCab Museum,Try the eco trail. PhP 250 ‚Ä¶More
BenCab Museum,"I was very impressed and glad to finally visit BenCab Museum!This is definetely a place to go if you are in Baguio.Car park available at the front of the building and also along the road.Once you have paid for your ticket, you will be informed/reminded that pictures are permitted however without flash. No videos allowed. You will also be given a map of the Museum.Toilets facility is available inside the premises.There is also a restaurant/cafeteria where you can enjoy a meal, coffee or simply a snack with a beautiful view. The food and coffee are really good.There is an outside area of which I enclosed some pictures. Is very beautiful and peaceful.Inside there are different sections with a variety of subjects and artworks, I won't post any pictures because I took too many and I don't know which one to chose. I think you should really go and experience it yourself,  is worth it :)Enjoy!Thank you,AMestizaInManila"
BenCab Museum,Galleries are always updated. Its always a new experience everytime I visit.I visited again during the pandemic which was awesome because I got the place (almost) all for myself. I was heartbroken by the time I visited this place because of an unexpected turn of events from an employment opportunity in the city but visiting this place made me forget the worries. Viewing the artworks was soothing.
BenCab Museum,"Aside from the astounding art pieces in the museum, the view on the museum's balconies is amazing. You could also grab lunch at Cafe Sabel in the lower ground floor or take pictures at lake just outside the museum's cafe."
BenCab Museum,The place is far from the city of Baguio but that makes it better since it does not become overcrowded. The location is also idyllic and you could go and relax here.The works and collection of our national artist is really interesting. There are tours and the tour guides are very accommodating and will answer your questions.They also have a cafe and the food is good. They have an ecopark which comes with a minimal fee.Restrooms are clean as well.
BenCab Museum,"This is a really great place with beautiful art. First of all, I appreciated the fact that the place is accessible via public transport. I find Bencab Museum to be similar to Pinto Art Museum and I think I've spotted a few artists at artworks on Bencab that have been previously displayed at Pinto Art. Not 100% sure about this though. I enjoyed our own quiet time looking at art and also appreciating nature outside the museum. It's my first time in the museum and I feel like I haven't fully appreciated what the place has to offer. So I will definitely come back and give it a second visit the next time I am in town."
BenCab Museum,"Museum had a good range of exhibits and a koi pond. There is no Grab service here, so be prepared with your return transportation in advance."
BenCab Museum,An awesome museum. Very nice collection of art. The cafe and outdoor area is definitely worth exploring
BenCab Museum,"A lot to see in this museum, worth the entrance fee of P120 pesos per head. An array of paintings and varied artworks of talented artists are on display to amaze and tickle one's mind. üòâ There's also a caf√© on the lower level to satisfy one's hunger pangs! Very nice garden, too! Must-visit when in Baguio!"
BenCab Museum,We paid 150 pesos (adult rate - if I remember correctly) for entrance fee. And I think it's worth it especially if you are fascinated with arts. You can go here via local jeep. And go back to the town via jeep as well to save you money.
BenCab Museum,"It's a beautiful place for art lovers. Entrance is P150 each, but offer discounts to all student, PWD and Seniors just present your ID's.Bencab is closed every Monday. Open from 9am to 6pm Tuesday to Sunday."
BenCab Museum,"A multi split-level museum with specific room for sculptures, relics, artworks, etc. which help us to roam around the museum without any hamper and foot traffic. They also have cafe at the lower ground of the building which a lil bit pricey. But all-in-all, it's a good place to relax and get some ideas if you're into arts.By the way, don't forget to bring your student i.d. üòâ"
BenCab Museum,I am really amazed by the artworks presented as well as the history presented by mr. Dizon from his memory. It has a cafe inside. Tours in the museum depends on the number of people you are in a group. Nevertheless you could just tour it by yourself and take the time that you want. Wood arts are also presented by the culture of benguet. Amazing!!
BenCab Museum,The place is quite far but you can easily ride a taxi going here. Entrance fee is P120 pesos per person. There are parking spaces available for those who will bring their own car.The place has good collection of paintings and sculptures. The view is alao instagram worthy. You can also eat at Cafe Isabel.
BenCab Museum,"Such a very maintain place, wonderful and very educational,  children will enjoy looking around. Seing the masterpieces of different artists. The place also displays the beauty of nature with is island gazebo."
BenCab Museum,"Great artwork pieces by BenCab and other Filipino artists. I love the landscape behind the building and the view of a hill across which is fully covered with trees. It is just so beautiful, so relaxing. They serve good food too...a must visit in Baguio. Entrance is P150 but all worth it."
BenCab Museum,"Beautifully landscaped garden and forest trail, awesome sceneries to behold, very stress relieving! Varied and interesting paintings, stimulates the creative side of visitors!"
BenCab Museum,"We visited the Bencab Museum during our 3 nights stay in Baguio City, on our way to Banaue, January 2016. We got a very good, friendly & very knowledgeable young man as Museum Guide. It was a very interesting & informative museum visit with regards to native history & art. We also managed to have coffee & ice cream in their cafeteria. It is located outside the City but definitely worth visiting for a few hours. Highly recommendable."
BenCab Museum,"A nice way to know the indigenous tribe of the Cordilleras..You can have a Museum tour cost of P150 per head. See all the greates art of Ben Cabrera and artifacts from the tribes displayed on the museum.You can also get the eco tour for P150 per head, guide included and stroll on the vast 6 hectar total garden. Learn about some of the native tribes and anjoy the view.Meals are available as well on their Cafe.A bit pricey for the water. P60 per 500ml bottle but the bottle says all sales will got to charity... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
BenCab Museum,"LIKE A HAIKUBy: Jeannie E.JavelosaToday, I entered a haiku poem. in three parts:  the Beauty of Art expressed. Nature‚Äôs Spirit speaking.  Palate pleasures pursued. Here visiting an old friend‚Äôs museum in Benguet and all at once a package of world class experiences curated by our National Artist BenCab, emerges. Paintings, prints, his collection of bulol rice grainary traditional sculptures, contemporary art of artists he supports are the first come-one; then, an Eco-hike that takes you around the museum (including farm plots where vegetables are grown for the cafe Sabel), and into the wild of the mountain trail. The prize? Spectacular views, waterfalls  and clean mountain air.  We cap our experience with delicious farm to table slow-food type cuisine (fried itik which is a local duck, watercress salad, creamy risotto like mountain rice, pumpkin-carrot soup and mountain rice suman sa latik) as one looks out into the hill slowly disappearing from view as the fog quietly engulfs it.  So quiet this place...as we were the only ones there. Until Ben comes out and a weird reunion of sorts with masks and social distancing mark our place and the unique time we are in. But no matter... for the experience of beauty that he has created in his destination place here in Tuba, Benguet stops all time - past, present and future. A place we always would want to return to. For it is like a timeless masterful haiku poem that fills both spirit and senses. #travelswiththejeannie #supportlocalbusinesses #slowtravel #naturelover #journeywiththejeannie"
BenCab Museum,"It's a nice place for people who knows how to appreciate art. There are lots of art to see. The the type of art in this museum is not so intriguing for me, since I'm not an art enthusiast myself. But it's a friendly place for instagramers and people who pretends to know art. #eisenphireChecked"
BenCab Museum,"First of all, the museum is located a bit far from the city so you have to arrange a transportation back and forth.It's a three storey museum filled with artworks, paintings and sculptures about northern cultures. You'll get to know more of their history by visiting this place. Perfect venure for art lovers.The garden at the back helps you forget your problems for a while lol. Sitting in the cottage gave me the most relaxing 15 minutes of my life üòÅ."
BenCab Museum,"Awesome museum with a large collection of Filipino art - paintings, sculptures, furniture and indigenous pieces. The displayed art pieces are not only by Ben Cab (owner) but also by other Filipino artists. The general admission of 150 php is very worth it.The museum is very contemporary with spacious white interiors. There is a cafe at the lower floor which faces a koi pond and garden. The museum also offers an ecotrail/ hiking which has a separate fee. Highly recommended for tourists visiting Baguio."
BenCab Museum,Very nice work of art. The place is fantastic with great view. entrance fee is 150-200 per person cant remember the exact price.
BenCab Museum,"If you love paintings, this is your place to go. Staff are accomodating and the place is not crowded. You will also love the outside ambiance if the weather permits. There is a cafe also if you'll feel famished."
BenCab Museum,"Great artworks, great views.There‚Äôs a Cafe at the first floor (Cafe Sabel) with a great view of their pond and mountain ranges with lushes of greens."
BenCab Museum,"There so many art pieces to be seen and to be loved. If you are an art lover or love the Philippine's history, culture and tradition, this place is very worth visiting!"
BenCab Museum,"Excellent lay out with a good, varied collection of art work. Not a very big museum which makes it manageable.Nice cafe on site and also well presented garden area for a short stroll.If you're lucky you'll be able to meet the maestro himself who is always willing to spend a few minutes with you and have a photo with you. A real gentleman.Well worth a visit if you're in Baguio."
BenCab Museum,"BenCab Museum is a little bit out of the way compare to other Baguio sites, after all its in Tuba. The road going here is a little bit quite and lonely since its far from other tourist spots but the visit was indeed a very memorable one. BenCab Museum showcases not just Cordillera's arts and sculptures, it also houses contemporay arts made by young artists. The museum was a work of art and it complements the serene environment it was situated.A definitely a must visit place."
BenCab Museum,It‚Äôs an honor to have visited a national artist‚Äôs museum.
BenCab Museum,"BenCab works epitomize the struggles of his generation, of Philippine history. His collection of arts and sculptures at his museum is one for the books when you visit Baguio."
BenCab Museum,"Beautiful artwork. Great destination for solo or small groups. Lots of stairs, don't bring grandparents"
BenCab Museum,Love this musuem. Small but includes worthy artworks. Entrance fee cost 120 pesos. For public transportation from city center it costs us 250 pesos (fix rate not metered as per the taxi driver since it is far) around 20-40mins travel time depending on the traffic. nice view and you get to see different types of art pieces.
BenCab Museum,A must place to visit to those who have a  heart for arts.Very interesting and some of the sculptures or artifacts were a representation of ethnicity in the mountain province.And also the garden at the back of the museum is a good place to relax and enjoy the view of nature.
BenCab Museum,One of the best museums Ive ever been to. Literally one of the most facinating and most chic. Contemporary arts and a pinch of surrealism. Everything s is just love!
BenCab Museum,"Great artwork from awesome artist. Amazing ideas ,?creativity and imagination. Beauty is on the eye of the beholder ,as said. You gonna love it ,if your fond of arts."
BenCab Museum,Brings the artistic you with mesmerizing art display. Gives you the throwback feel from the early Filipino culture. Wasn't able to try the food serve here since we have a reservation with another location. But definitely a place you need to visit when your in Baguio.
BenCab Museum,"Cool museum put up by the Ben Cabrera if you like and enjoy arts as personal expression. Entrance fee at 150/ head. Not too crowded this time, although travel is quite around 30-45min from the city center. Enjoyed the variety of art pieces and how they were put together for the public to realize we have great local artists! Great work!"
BenCab Museum,This place reminds me of the Met museum in NYC which is cool! Def worth the visit if u ever go to Baguio!
BenCab Museum,Beautiful museum. Worth the drive over. Real nice art and an amazing lunch cafe with crazy good prices and nice view of gardens and fish pond.
BenCab Museum,Nice place to visit since there were really few people
BenCab Museum,Amazing place to enjoy the afternoon. Outstanding artwork and artifacts. There is a gallery hosted within that has rotating exhibits to purchase from as well. The cafe and grounds are a good place to relax and enjoy the views.
BenCab Museum,The place is huge and of course full of art pieces. It is 25 to 30 minutes away from Baguio City. You can ride a jeep that cost 12pesos or take a taxi for 190 to 220pesos (depends on traffic).
BenCab Museum,Great exhibit. ‚ù§Ô∏èI also love the view in this place. üòç
BenCab Museum,A Very nice Museum worth visiting with family or friends.  Excellent paintings and different art works can be seen here.
BenCab Museum,"I was able to appreciate the work in a quiet atmosphere, and it is healing in a pretty garden."
BenCab Museum,"This superb museum is one of the best places to visit in the whole of the Philippines. Located in a beautiful valley in BenCab's very own estate, this is a stunning home for some outstanding artwork. EcoTours of the estate are also available and last approx. 1hr (additional charges apply). The cafe is excellent too. The artefacts from the Cordellera are also excellent with a vast collection from all over the region. This really is an outstanding place to visit. Visit time for the gallery is about 1hr but you can easily stay longer if you want to eat, do the ecotour or just simply enjoy the view. Wildlife lovers should also enjoy the variety of bird life especially the numerous sunbirds in the surrounding gardens."
BenCab Museum,"It‚Äôs quite a distance from downtown Baguio but the half-hour trip was worth it. This lovely, well-curated art museum showcases the rich culture of the Cordillera highlands and the work of local artists. Each floor on the museum has a scenic lookout offering panoramic views of the surrounding mountains. There is also a caf√© serving local dishes and drinks.For those taking public transportation, it is relatively easy to reach the museum by cab or jeepney. From the museum, however, there is a bit of wait for cabs and the ones that do arrive are most likely dropping off visitors. It can therefore be a challenge finding a cab an hour or so before the museum closes. The jeepney stop is not far away but if you arrive to a near-empty jeepney, there will be a bit of a wait too. I saw people trying to hitch a ride in vain."
BenCab Museum,"Place is quite a good time to spend in. For art appreciation lookers or museum hoppers. Food in cafe Sabel was quite pricy, there a resto nearby Happy Tummy, you cam try it for those who dont habe thick wallets"
BenCab Museum,"Visiting the BenCam Museum is quite refreshing even if you are not an art enthusiast, the museum has a small entrance fee and photography is allowed except for professional photography and no selfie sticks. The museum has different levels that houses contemporary arts from painting to sculptures, from wooden sculptures to ceramics, they have also a lot of photographs and stencils and if your really appreciate art you would enjoy this visit. I like visiting museums and art show whenever I travel or whenever its possible, the building is modern, clean and tidy. I enjoyed the art collection but the genre of the art isnt for me, I more enjoyed european medieval arts, or ancient greek, roman and egyptian arts but like what I said its a contemporary art collection. The ground level has a cafe where you could refresh and relax, there is also a pond and a nipa hut in the middle where we spent some time. The museum is far from the city centre, we took a cab to the museum and we left the museum before dark fall and there are no cabs outside, luckily the employees are also going home and an empty jeep is waiting for them, we took the same ride. Its worth a visit, something new. They do have a lot of penile sculptures, penis is a big part of the culture."
BenCab Museum,"You'll appreciate it if you're into arts. Other than that, there's a cafe and a big garden if you want to chill"

BenCab Museum,"Disadvantage for groups/ family who will not ALL go inside the museum, you have to pay before using the toilet . However, the place is serene and the artworks is something we can be proud of as filipino."
BenCab Museum,"Inspiring place for those artists and non-artists. Didn't know Ben Cab is such a talented one. He uses different media in his crafts. You will also discover different artists and artworks in this museum. Very affordable price and you will appreciate nature here, as well! ‚ù§"
BenCab Museum,First time here and I love it. A bit far from the city center. I wish we went there a bit earlier.
BenCab Museum,Great place to see Bencab's work and those of other local artists too.Entrance fee is Php100 for adults. Not a lot of parking spaces available but they allow you to park along the street. Place is pretty busy on weekends.We didn't know there were guided tours and we missed it. I'm sure the tour would have been very informative and educational. Our trip to Bencab was still very good.Make sure you set aside time to hang out in the garden.
BenCab Museum,"There are a variety of artworks shown for everyone's enjoyment. From historical pieces to contemporary artists that has a unique perspective to an eco-trail (not available as of June 14, 2022), this is a great family-friendly destination!"
BenCab Museum,"Place is a bit far from the city center, but people go here nonetheless to see and appreciate the art works by Ben Cabrera. The art pieces are stunning. Place is well-maintained but I'm reserving my one star for a full 5/5 because some of the lights shining on the paintings were flickering."
BenCab Museum,There are art pieces everywhere you turn! It's a really cool museum with nice views from the veranda. The only downside is the location which is a little far from the town center.
BenCab Museum,Visit the museum early if you want to enjoy and appreciate the art pieces. ‚Ä¶More
BenCab Museum,"A nice place to be in. Sourrounding yourself with nature and art, it was more than satisfying. I saw a collection there dated 15-16th century works of remrandt and so on.  It was amazing! As an art enthusiast myself i got to see amazing works of art from filipinos such as bencab ofcourse. You cant go to baguio without visiting this place!üòçüòçüòçüòÑüòÑüòÑüôÑüòÄ"
BenCab Museum,"This is a really  must  see Museum.  Great artworks, Ben was there  when we're  there. 120  Peso is really  worth:)But  the cab  that wait  for us charged us a 700 peso just  for  a 30minutes  of waiting.  Bloody  Hell.  Can't  do  anything."
BenCab Museum,"A must for those whose into arts. Do ask for a guide to appreciate the museum. There are many instagram worthy locations within the museum, just be creative."
BenCab Museum,This place is a must see if you are in Baguio. ‚Ä¶More
BenCab Museum,"The Museum was great BUT the cafe has a long way to go to be, at least, ok.The surrounding area is exceptional. I will keep going back to that cafe as their Ceasar's salad was wilted and had soggy croutons (so soggy that it felt it was left out for a few hours or so). Upon complaining with Mike, the supposedly manager, he just smiled and said sorry like it was just to brush me away. Insulting and very improperly impolite to just accept how bad his product was.That experience was enough to upset my whole itenerary of leisurely taking in the grounds and the art.Disappointed here."
BenCab Museum,"Lots of places to take pictures here, another good place to stop over when you visit baguio"
BenCab Museum,"Loved the exhibits, the museum architecture, and the ponds at the bottom part. Nice view as well, towards the late afternoon."
BenCab Museum,"If you're into Art of any form, and painting, you'll surely love this place. Indoor and outdoor, the place is IG worthy. You also get to learn a little of the PH culture and history. Worth visiting when you are in Baguio. Been here twice (2014) and last Nov 2019,but will surely comeback to this place again if I visit Baguio."
BenCab Museum,Things you should do in baguio list amazing art and creativity nice background area pond and cafe was great good food they have little strawberry farm so no need to visit strawberry farm in la Trinidad if you been to Bencab they try to build more garden thing at back I like to visit soon and must have car or ask the taxi pick u up certain time specially at late afternoon they close at 5pm
BenCab Museum,"It was pretty good place, but i don't want to say u must visit bencab. If u want to go there without a car, I suggest u make sure how to return after enjoying Bencab. There was no taxi. I had to walk to a jeepney stop for 10 mins and wait there for 10 mins."
BenCab Museum,Great place to visit. Just be careful with umbrella thefts. You will be able to see the creativeness of every artist who's work are displayed within the 4 story building. They also have an econtrail. Did not try it because of the heavy rain during my visit.
BenCab Museum,"Really love the place, it's to die for. The view is breathtaking ü§© ‚Ä¶More"
BenCab Museum,A famous local museum in Baguio City oftenly known for its vast collection of artifacts from its indigenous people and creations from the local famous painter bencab.

BenCab Museum,"The place is far from the rest of the city but it is definitely worth it. Is cultural, modern and very artistic. I really liked my experience because there's freedom in taking photos like copying the poses in the paintings. The architecture of the museum is also amazing. There's a cafe at the lower ground which quench my thirst."
BenCab Museum,We always enjoy visiting the BenCab Museum whenever we visit Baguio. Not easily accessible but sure worth the side trip!
BenCab Museum,"We went there just this afternoon. The gallery is nice and curated arts were superb. üëå Also, there are few people coming in so we got a chance to get good photos. The museum is located on the outskirts of Baguio and expect a mild delay on transportation as taxis are limited though there's a jeep terminal somewhere nearby. The museum offers cafeteria inside and a souvenir shop."

It is best to come here on off-peak days (weekdays) so there are less people to crowd the exhibits.The museum is multi-level (expect lots of stairs) with a cafe/restaurant on the lowest floor. The cafe sources ingredients from their own farm. There is also a scenic view deck with a view of the mountains, take the time to visit the view deck as it's very easy to miss the door leading to it.They have a guided eco-trail tour which will take you around their farm and various other spots where you can see huts, gardens, and a little bit of forest."

BenCab Museum,"If you're into art, this is a good place for you to go. I think BenCab showcase the culture of baguio, aligning the past to present society. You could see Japanese and american portraits and even european influence to his art style and other artist. Through their art, it felt like you're traveling through time from the start of pre colonial era and how relevant and important these cultures are in the present time. It's a must visit placePlus they have a restaurant thst you could try after looking at the exhibits."

Different pieces of different artist, not only of the known artist BenCab is in there. The scenery of the overlooking is also a great sight. The entrance fee for a museum is a little bit high but still it still is worth the pay especially if you're a art guy.Also there is a small restaurant at the bottom of the museum that is managed by the museum it self. The food is great, the service is also good. The garden is free to visit and take a leisure walk and take a lot of pictures because of the good landscaping."
BenCab Museum,"Lots of paintings, sculptures, in different styles, for different ages, up to those who are interested in erotic art. The museum is of multiple floors, with art works presented and grouped in rooms. There is a cafe inside the museum. Nice outdoor view, with hut and plenty of plants. Getting here can be by taxi at a reasonable rate, or jeep for a more affordable rate if you are willing to wait."
BenCab Museum,Bencab must be on your itinerary. I just wish there's another entrance straight to the cafe
BenCab Museum,Expensive entrance fee considering the numbers of artwrork that you will see inside. Clean toilet.
BenCab Museum,Good place for the people who love arts.
BenCab Museum,"One of the most celebrated wood carver,  painter,  a national artist who takes great pride in his work. Each painting, each carving was a representation of how he expresses himself.  Each gallery has a theme and group accordingly. A view of the garden at the back of the gallery/museum was also great for selfies or groupies. But I suggest to learn about the stories each painting inside the museum before taking pictures. There's also a cafe at the ground floor leading to the back garden. I've been here once and that was back in 2010. It was December and tourist was scarce that time. Had a photo even of the fog..  Try to visit if you happen to go to Baguio. The museum wasn't far from the city proper. You could also ask directions from locals and they will help you."

Nice cafe toüòã"
BenCab Museum,An amazing collection of paintings and various forms of art. Benedicto Cabrera at its best.
BenCab Museum,"A year ago my family went there to enjoy the sceneries and the works of art that the place could offer. The place was wonderful and the art works were really speaking to me. The only thing that was below expectation was the food and the expensiveness of it. I would have gladly spent money but the food was not even that special. Overall, if you want to appreciate art you should go here."
BenCab Museum,"The place is huge with so many artworks to see, coupled with amazing scenery from the viewing decks as well as the outdoor section. Went with teammates as last leg of team building activity, I wasn't able to enjoy it as much though, since I brought my toddler along and there were lots of 'do not touch' signs. üòÖ"
BenCab Museum,A place where you could appreciate nature and art at the same time. It is a small but cozy museum. Artworks and sculptures displayed are mixed of modern and classic art. There's a lot of IG worthy spot.Entrance of 150 is reasonable although the place is a bit far from the city proper but it's worth it.
BenCab Museum,"Got to meet the national artist here, Ben Cabrera. Awesome. ‚Ä¶More"
BenCab Museum,"The art pieces were really great, and the views are perfect for taking photos. There is a cafe inside the Museum which serves food and drinks. Great overall experience."
BenCab Museum,Best to go before they open at Nine am.
BenCab Museum,Not crowded. The art is not to my taste and the entrance fee is steep considering
BenCab Museum,Ifugao folk art with contemprary local artists in a unique gallery  good for a day tour.
BenCab Museum,Best place for art lovers and instagramable shots
BenCab Museum,"First, the paintings were made by different artists so you'll see different kind and type of paintings. Mr. Ben's masterpiece tho are superb, really great.  It will definitely inspire and motivate people who are into arts. Second, not only paintings are to see here but also lots of woodworks sculpted by awesome artists as well. Vintage sculptures are a must see. Third, some who didn't recommend the place were against the employees but for me they were actually nice. They will tell you things that you need to know before proceeding in the museum and there are comfort rooms you can use, for free. Lastly, you have to see the garden as well. I think I'll stop there. You have to see it yourself. :-)"
BenCab Museum,"Super love this art musuem. Been here 4 times but never get tired of going. Great exhibition of pieces by  national artist Ben Cabrera, up and coming artists as well as indigenous artwork from various native tribes found in the region. The museum is wonderfully designed and has a zen, relaxing atmosphere as well as a nice garden that you can stroll and relax in."
BenCab Museum,"A must visit if you like paintings, sculptures and arts in general . Its a 3 storey art museum with a cozy cafe. At the back of the building, there are fishes and huts where you can just sit and relax and enjoy the view of the nature. You can feel almost sleepy because of the fresh cold air."
BenCab Museum,Love the arts and sceneries. Very relaxing
BenCab Museum,"The place is quite a bit of a travel from the city centre. But people can easily access the place via taxi. Going back to city wont be a problem since there is high foot traffic in this area. You can also ask taxi drivers to wait for you too. While its a bit far, its totally worth your visit. It houses a lot of artwork paintings and others. There is also a gallery of artifacts from native times that will give you a glimpse of history. When taking pictures dont be shy to ask gallery attendants to help you out, they know the place too well and can do some unique trick shots. There is also a cafe available for visitors. Food is 4.5 out of 5. Try to take some time to explore their small garden and enjoy the view of the mountainside."
BenCab Museum,The place is a bit difficult to go to but worth checking out once. Pro tip: They also sell ube and/or strawberry taho outside the museumüëçüòç
BenCab Museum,"This is the only place that makes me keep coming back to Baguio! After finishing a tour in the museum which will definitely satisfy the artist in you, the cafe is absolutely heaven. Food is great and awesome although quite pricey. The view is amazing. Its quiet and perfect for those who are soul searching/ traveling alone."
BenCab Museum,Nature and Art. Even  just the act of exploring this place  is art in itself. A must see when in Baguio
BenCab Museum,"Wide range of art exhibits. Very nice view of landscape behind the museum, relaxing and you will appreciate nature. They have small cafe so you can have light snacks, coffee and other refreshments."
BenCab Museum,"Different one from the usual places to visit when in  Baguio, a bit pricey when it comes to entrance fee."
BenCab Museum,You will love the place whether you're a fan of Bencab/of art in general or not. Great that the museum encourages other artists and other genres by showcasing their works. The cafe has good food and great coffee. Highly recommended when you're in Baguio. 15-20 minutes from the city proper. Be there at opening time (9AM) to avoid the crowds (and traffic).
BenCab Museum,A good way to end your trip in Baguio with a stimulus of fascinating art.
BenCab Museum,"Nothing to see except for sculptures and paintings. If you are not an artsy person, this is not the place for you. Ticket cost at p150. They also have street parking.It's good though that you could stay at their coffee shop while your artsy friends are still busy analyzing the paintings and sculptures."
BenCab Museum,Great place to visit if you're passing by. Bonus: The restaurant is great.
BenCab Museum,Great art works..... world class masterpieces...
BenCab Museum,"My family and friends gave this place a visit last year. It was a nice break from the usual stuff that you can visit in Baguio. I'm not really into art but I enjoyed what they have on offer. It was raining when we visited ... that prevented us from viewing the ""park"" outside though."
BenCab Museum,Wonderful mix of Filipino art. I love its location in the valley below Baguio City. It feels like a space where you can take in the art in the peace of nature. Too bad too many people visit it. It's best to experience the museum during weekdays when visitors are minimal.
BenCab Museum,A great place to immerse yourself in the culture and indigenous heritage of the Cordilleras and in Ben Cabral's contemporary art.
BenCab Museum,Nice place to explore for knowing more the Cordillera culture.
BenCab Museum,"Very liberating art works and different from the usual museum because they exhibited not just the artworks but a garden and a cafe. While you can finish your visit half a day, you will fill fulfilled. and P150 is worth it."
BenCab Museum,"There were a lot of interesting sculptures that featured the wood-carving artistry of the mountain people. We came in on a rainy day and went down to visit the garden and koi pond. The place has a quiet, calming feel, surrounded by mountain peaks."
BenCab Museum,Nice place to visit. Art lovers will surely adore this place.
BenCab Museum,"Great artworks, great experience, wonderful visit. Highly recommended. üòä"
BenCab Museum,"It's very good to see Filipino heritage and arts.  It's a nice museum.  Worth visiting indeed.One issue is lack of wheelchair access, it's a new building and should have been built to cater for all.  Google maps said is is wheelchair accessible.. sadly it's not."
BenCab Museum,Lots of interesting art. The cafe has awesome ambiance.
BenCab Museum,Nice painting & art and location
BenCab Museum,"Temporary galleries makes it worth coming back to. The current exhibit about a travel diary made with watercolor was interestingly fun. The permanent artworks became timeless to my eyes. It is always worth noting that the view is very beautiful and lush, making the experience more pleasant.All is good except for the cafe, while it had good ambience, I am not really a big fan of what they offer. The coffee we got were too watered down and it was not worth our money.Try to go sometime without much tourists, it's one of the best museums in Baguio."
BenCab Museum,"We arrived 1hr before closing, the staff were not at all welcoming and at quarter to closing time were rushing us already to exit. We just paid entrance to eat at the resto, not much time to look at the artwork. We don't like the attitude üòíof the staff. Also, they were not properly wearing face shields when they require guest to wear them."
BenCab Museum,"If you're at Baguio, don't miss visiting this museum! It is quite far from Burnham park (as a point of reference) but our travel time took only less than 30 mins. The ticket price is less than 200 (150 I think?) and discounts are given to kids who can present their school ID upon buying tickets. There are a lot of magnificent paintings showcased in the museum, plus a breathtaking view located at the back of the museum. They also have a cafe store there if you got hungry during your visit there. Overall, our experience there is worthwhile, and we'll surely visit again once we return to Baguio."
BenCab Museum,"Small and beautiful museum. Owner is Mr. Bencab who is most famous artist in Philippines. Entrance fee is 150 pesos, inside cafe has nice and beautiful green view .  but during weekend so many tourists are there."
BenCab Museum,"Awesome, the location is so great away form the city's irritable noise, the climate is good also. Every art for me is a master piece, it never fails to amuse me. My concern was the front desk doesn't recognize my Student ID to avail the student discount but still I enjoyed and learne a lot."
BenCab Museum,"I enjoyed my trip here. The entrance fee of PHP150. 00 is reasonable enough since the museum houses the many different art collections of our national artist Bencab. When you see all his work you will really say that he deserved to be called the national artist. I admire his used of different medium in his work. I am quite astounded on his attention to details  that shows his passion and patience.The museum also has a breathtaking view of the adjacent garden, farm, hill and mini-forest. Plus the views of the surrounding mountains.There is also a cafe inside in which you can spend time with friends while enjoying a good meal."
BenCab Museum,I dont had much fun to take photos in this place..they dont aloud mono pod and i am touring by myself..just handling your phone cant get a good angle!
BenCab Museum,Taking the art and talent of Pinoy in an international level.
BenCab Museum,"Amazing museum, phantastic landscape, mind-blowing Eco tour, beautiful sunset and an absolutely delicious lunch in the Caf√©!!! One of the best experiences in Baguio. Thank you Ben! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
BenCab Museum,Place has calming vibe and insta worthy. Try their pasta dishes it won't disappoint.
BenCab Museum,One of the must visit tourist spots in Baguio. Though the road to get there can be full of up and downhills the museum is definitely a must visit since it features a vareity of artworks from both famous and local painters. It also a restaurant and an outdoor park where you can take lots of pictures.
BenCab Museum,"If you're a person who appreciate art and enjoys looking at the beautiful art pieces, then this is a must-go-to place. The place is very far but the trip going up the museum is worth the travel. There is a cafe but the choice of food is limited. I would love to try it next time."
BenCab Museum,The place is so relaxing and cozy. The museum showcase the sculptures and arts and cultures of the natives. The location of the museum is really far from thr city but worth it. You can ride a jeep going back and forth or ride a taxi.
BenCab Museum,"My family and I wanted to come here to escape the overwhelming crowd in Baguio, hoping that it wouldn't be as such. However there were still so many people here although not as much.I've never been to this museum before and it was quite interesting. It showed the traditional arts of the natives. Guests can learn a lot about the culture and history of the region. Paintings and sculptures lined the walls although with penises and vaginas.The cafe was out of the blue serving pasta. Drinks were too sweet.Overall, I'd give this a recommendation for a visit in Baguio."
BenCab Museum,Lots of paintings and Ifugao related art. Huge place with coffee shop and a trial to enjoy. The only down is you can't appreciate the art as much since people are usually just taking photos around using the painting as backdrops.
BenCab Museum,"super great place to visit!!!! the paintings are really fantastic. wear your hiking shoes and take the guided tour of the eco-trail. nice view up there in the mountain- the beauty of nature. Ryan, the tour guide and photographer, did a good job in guiding us."
BenCab Museum,"The garden was a great addition to the museum. It gives diversity and a wonderful area for children to enjoy. Its a complete experience: art, culture, scenery and food. I just hope some of the gallery has  different motif."
BenCab Museum,"I've been to other museum, and i found this place inferior. Sort of over rated. Significantly small so you'll get bored easily. No comments about the artwork displays, just how the museum presents them; its so dull."
BenCab Museum,Place is cool and clean. Awesome artworks too.
BenCab Museum,"Great collection with a nice caf√©. The house and the grounds/garden itself is amazing on it's own. There's a hiking tour you can try to explore the area. Good value for money as well, entrance is less than 200 php"
BenCab Museum,Nice view and all artworks ar splendid.
BenCab Museum,"Quite crowded when you go over the weekend. If you want to appreciate the beautiful artworks you have to visit during the weekdays.  Although far from Baguio city's central business district, you do not have to worry about food because Cafe Sabel is just at the ground floor of the museum."
BenCab Museum,We loved the garden view while enjoying cappuccino and turon ala mode at their Cafe Sabel. We also chased some fog. The museum itself gives you a proud feeling for having National Artist Bencab. We were lucky to have a chat with him and ask about his iconic Sabel among other things. It also features his collection of Cordillera art and culture as well as works of local artists
BenCab Museum,"I would consider this a must see, not only for the great museum and garden, but also for a good drive through suburban villages. I would suggest paying your cab to wait for you. The museum has a lot of traditional pieces and a lots of contemporary paintings."
BenCab Museum,Great place not so crowded... love the arts and paintingsüòáüòáüòá
BenCab Museum,Enjoyed every art piece and the place as well
BenCab Museum,"A bit challenging to find the place, but it was still worth the trip! Reminder to students to bring their IDs to avail of the discount- though the fee isn't that bad at P120/head. It might help to have someone on standby in each area who can provide more info regarding the displays in case the guests would want to know more."
BenCab Museum,"Definitely worth a stop, and probably worth a trip to Baguio just to see this museum and grounds. There is BenCab's own collection of important contemporary artists, historical local wood carvings and a great cross section of BenCabs.  Also walks though their farm and virgin nature trail."
BenCab Museum,"The place is kind of far from the city, however, this museum house a vast collection of artworks from artist all over the country. You can also appreciate nature through their garden behind the museum building! Be sure to ask your taxi driver to wait for you (for an additional price) since taxi's and jeepneys does not come by often."
BenCab Museum,Accessibility: It is along a main road and is accessible by private ride or taxi. Grab Taxi is available in Baguio City and you may hire the cab. Jeepneys also pass along the way.Ambience: Nature with a touch of modern architectureArt: The art pieces in the museum depict life in all aspects. My son enjoyed the tour.Cafe: It has cafe to quench your thirst and satisfy your palate.Guided Tours are available for the nature trails. Non guuded tours are limited upto the lagoon.
BenCab Museum,Nice view. Thick and luscious  trees infront of the view deck of the museum. There's snack area where you could buy and eat after an up and down walk looking to the art works.
BenCab Museum,You can find new taste here. Food is not cheap but is ok. Art is cool!
BenCab Museum,"Fabulous Museum and Garden.  National artist Ben Cabrera has assembled one of the best collections in the Nation, beautifully displayed.  Downstairs there is a lovely cafe with excellent coffee and meals."
BenCab Museum,if your curious about painting.. worth it to come here
BenCab Museum,Nice place to appreciate arts and nature but i find the entrance fee too expensive.
BenCab Museum,"Loved the art works, loved the location, loved the scenery"
BenCab Museum,"Bencab Museum is located along side Road in Tuba, Benguet,  The museum building built in a highland that has a magnificent view, alongside of a garden, farm with strawberries, hill and mini-forest. What an awesome view to relax and have some fresh and cool air of natures."
BenCab Museum,"Nothing much to say beyond what others have. Fantastic museum. Could easily lose many hours here which is surprising given it is really not all that big. You find yourself moving slowly, taking in every piece. Memorizing. The staff are friendly too."
BenCab Museum,Artworks and sculptures displayed are diverse of modern and classic art. Entrance fee is 150 pesos. Place is well-maintained. This place is worth the visit though it is too far from the city.
BenCab Museum,Known for its IG-worthy spots
BenCab Museum,"B E N C A BI've enjoyed it so much. The four-level museum is packed of creativity and talent. Also, I love the eye-relaxing view with beautiful landscape (with pond and a hanging bridge which leads to an eco-trail along a forested slope).They also have a restaurant/cafe na super sarap ng mga foods. A visit to BenCab is highly recommended. Worth it yung binayad nyo!"
BenCab Museum,Most of the people who i bring here in the museum appreciates it and love the scenery. Its surrounded by mountains and they added a trail activity that comes with an additioanal fee.i highly recommend this place for people who also wanna learn a bit of cordilleran culture. Take nite that they are close on mondays :)
BenCab Museum,Amazing! The artworks are so breathtaking you won't realize the place is three storey. Lol
BenCab Museum,Wasn't able to take pictures because I was too busy admiring the artwork. This place is worth the trip. I personally think the fee they charge is way low for what you get to experience. This is a must visit!
BenCab Museum,Nice exhibit of native art.Sufficient parking.
BenCab Museum,"Awesome place. Taxi cabs will ask somewhere between Php300-400 per hour just to wait. Ask to just flag the meter going there and another meter going back. And just give them Php100-200 to wait an hour. Anyway, they wont be spending for gas and effort just waiting for you while you tour the museum. It will take you about 1 hour touring the museum, looking at art, and taking selfies at the garden. It doesnt include when you want to dine though."
BenCab Museum,A fresh relief from the Baguio busy streets. You can also find works of other artists. Try to come earlier in the morning or off peak days to digest each art piece without the too much crowd. The usual flow of guest comes after lunch. Entrance fee is 100 peso but for students and senior citizens its 80 peso but a valid ID must be presented.
BenCab Museum,"I went there on Friday 8Feb 2019What a great place. If you are coming to Baguio, this Art Gallery is a must. They have a nice coffee shop on level 4 which serves light lunches. (GOOD COFFEE) Expect top spend at least 3 hours there viewing the art work. It's VERY impressive and not what you would expect from Baguio.If you want a more extensive lunch, try Happy Tummy, 2 doors up Asin Rd.If you are taking a Jeepney down, it costs P11, and you take it from the top of the Maket Place about 200meters below the  Baguio police station. If you are not sure where, make sure you ask someone. Ask for Km6 Asin Rd"
BenCab Museum,Chill place to appreciate artwork. Hard to go to and come back to the city if you have no car of your own just fyi. The garden is gorgeous and very good for picture purposes.
BenCab Museum,I'm not an artsy person. But I liked this place because the art pieces are organized well. Aside from that there's a cage and pond area at the lowest level perfect for picture taking.
BenCab Museum,Impressive art collections and nature park
BenCab Museum,Entrance fee is Php 150 which is not that bad considering the aesthetics of the place and the art pieces it has on display. It also has a very nice view of the houses on the side of the mountains.
BenCab Museum,"To appreciate culture and arts, visit BenCab Museum. Serves good coffee too."
BenCab Museum,Really nice collection. Don't forget to bring student's ID for discounted entrance fee
BenCab Museum,If you wanna see some artworks from ben cabrera go here. The artworks are good but the scenery appeals to me more. The place is beautiful with its scenery and I suggest you try their paid tour it's worth 80 maybe. You get a tour guide and go to the trek not accesible to those who do not pay for the tour.
BenCab Museum,Very nice and artistic place
BenCab Museum,"The place  is not that crowded when  we went there. The entrance fee is P150. They have a cafe inside (groundfloor level) the price ranges from P200 & up. They also have an Ecotour (P150 fee + P100 for the guide) an hour walk where you can see the garden, ponds, cross 2 bridges, Danom Falls, a bit of trail (pero hihingalin ka if hindi ka sanay sa mga paakyat) & old houses of different tribes."
BenCab Museum,"Relaxing place, good food (although slightly expensive for Baguio standards), good curation of artwork, great view. Recommended for art enthusiasts or those who want to have a chill baguio experience. My only issue is that the tour guide, a student trainee at that time, wasn't really efective and didn't explain anything. Would've been a good opportunity to train the student and at the same time impart knowledge to guests."
BenCab Museum,"My dream place, the behind part is better than the facade."
BenCab Museum,‚ú®     Great place
BenCab Museum,Wonderful work of art and view are one of the best
BenCab Museum,Great artworks from various artists.
BenCab Museum,"It's good. If you are art lover, this is the best place for you. The ticket is 150 pesos. You can roam around the museum in 20 minutes."
BenCab Museum,Very nicely maintained art museum with an interesting collection of works in a beautiful setting. Worth the trip from Baguio City (PHP 11 by Asin Jeepney or about 170 by taxi).
BenCab Museum,Interesting collections of artifacts and paintings from different times and styles.
BenCab Museum,Its a nice place for artlover..
BenCab Museum,It's amazing to masterpiece of our own artists
BenCab Museum,Amazing place to appreciate art more.
BenCab Museum,"Love the art museum and history behind artifacts in the Cordillera Gallery. Haven't tried their eco-trail but seeing it from afar and the people hiking, I'm sure the experience would be great. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
BenCab Museum,Still creepy as it used to be.One problem with us Filipinos is that we lack appreciation of history and for this reason we don't care about maintaining cultural heritage. Extra effort must be done to avoid more vandalism inside and out the old building.
BenCab Museum,"Many items om exhibit and nice trail. Excellent view. However, resto is expensive and public transport is a bit hard. Taxis reject hailing passengers when they say they want to got to bencab."
BenCab Museum,"Entrance : 150 adults, Eco trail for 1 hour is 100. With discounts for students, group tours and seniors.Cafe Sabel is located at the ground floor (2 level down from main road) where you can enjoy their foods and other drinks. Try spicy tuyo pasta if you're into hot and spicy foods."
BenCab Museum,"If you love art and paintings, this is the place for you in Baguio. However, it is a little bit fatmr in the city. Probably u neednto rent a cab as your transportation. However, the place is IG worthy with nice view in their balcony."
BenCab Museum,"Remote place but its worth the extra effort. If you cannot afford to buy artworks for sale, surely you can bargain hunt beautiful piece of wood carvings at local shops along the highway. If you are a fan of wood works, its heaven for you!"
BenCab Museum,We went there almost a month ago.I hope the collection was better.Anyway i love the view of the mountain scenery there.It was magnificent.Its just that i hope they could lower entrance fee to atleast 25% to make it more affordable for students.
BenCab Museum,"Good tour of artworks in different forms (paintings, carvings, etc). Food is okay as well. Breathtaking view esp. with presence of fog."
BenCab Museum,"Must see museum. 120 pesos per head entrance fee. :) to get there, you can ride a taxi from town that will cost you around 100 pesos or take the jeepney. The jeepney lines are found in Kayang street (around 15 pesos, i think). There are parts of it that's not for kids üòÇüòâüòâ. Nonetheless, it's a wonderful place."
BenCab Museum,If you appreciate art? You nid 2 visit it.
BenCab Museum,"The museum of one of our Philippine National Artist. Art inspired by the Cordilleras and the Highlanders, and also their artifacts and heritage. There's art of other aspiring national artists as well. There's an art souvenir shop, a small caf√©, a small park, and an eco-trail. Entrance fee is affordable, the caf√© and shop is a bit pricey but has unique selections, and a separate fee for eco-trail with tour guide. If you're lucky you will see Mr. Ben Cabrera himself. Overall, it's still a worthwhile visit for art, highlander history, and nature lovers out there."
BenCab Museum,"We went here early because we know that the place is far from the city proper, but don't know how the traffic is going here. We arrived 30min early. We were told to stay outside in the parking area. We asked nicely if we can have monoblock chairs that we can sit on but staff was rude. Didn't enjoy the visit here. No customer service."
BenCab Museum,"Fantastic collection of paintings, sketches, sculptures, carvings and many otber works of art by national artist Ben Cabrera and other Filipino artists. Very nice food served at Cafe Sabel with vegetables grown and harvested fresh from the organic farm. Guided museum and ecofarm tours are available upon request."
BenCab Museum,Very cozy ambiance...a quiet place...the paintings are beautiful but i love the self portrait of sir ben cabrera which is seen or placed right at the top wall facing the the door which is the entrance..im just not sure if its still there because my last visit was way back 2009...
BenCab Museum,"From someone who admittedly isn't familiar with local art: I appreciated the garden more than the museum itself. Also, they should install an elevator for the elderly/disabled."
BenCab Museum,Experience nature and art at the Bencab Museum.
BenCab Museum,A nice place to see artworks. They allow picture taking as long as you don't use flash. Nice to sit in their cafe and just absorb the moment.
BenCab Museum,Cozy place. Love the cafe.
BenCab Museum,"Too far and too expensive.  At ‚Ç±120/head, the collection in not that great to come and visit.  Not Senior Citizens friendly as there is no elevator and it is 4 storey down.  Restroom is 1 per sex and it is located 3 floors  down.  Hotel Luna in Vigan has a better collection like Juan Luna, Amorsolo and the like masters and it is even free to see.  The painting collection in Bencab are young and mostly dark feel for me, the oldest 2 painting I noticed was by Joya and Sanso and they were small.Visitors are not even artistically interested as they were noisy and busy taking family and group photos. Heck they do not even know who Bencab is.  Because there were no guides.  Some visitors were even touching furniture peices that were older than their parents that were clearly marked fragile do not touch."
BenCab Museum,"Nice place to visit for appreciating art and ifugao culture, and sightseeing mountain view as well. They also offer various snacks and (non-alcoholic) drinks in their coffee shop."
BenCab Museum,"This art haven is awesome and relaxing. Art collections are solid and the location itself is very close to nature. It feels like you are in the midst of paradise, a gift from the creator where the art creations are also being housed."
BenCab Museum,"The place is nice seeing the art of Bencab, but I think the entrance fee of 150 is a little pricey for general public. I would say the price should just 100."
BenCab Museum,it was a place that showcases sculpture in the eyes of Baguio artistry. my kids and i were awed by the big space i believe 4 floors but the most amazing area was the garden.the backdraft of a very quaint bahay kubo surrounded by a mini version of rice terraces was  my fave. my kids though really wanted to embrace the colorfuk joyous koi fishes in the geometrically assembled ponds. my gosh dobt forget to go to tge farthest ends of the garden coz they seem to place very strategic photo opts areas to capture nature at its closest u can almost kiss God for putging these greens browns and even hues of red on the mountains.they have cafe sabel to satisfy craves for coffee and shakes while you sit on again colorful benches.4 because maybe tgey could have a small portion where kids can also play and make their own sculptures and maybe bring home or leave there display and so leavs the place feeling so proud and feeling a part of the museum.kudos....let's promote this as a Baguio voice for true artistry. the blood that criesHail not onlyBaguio bht Philiplines
BenCab Museum,This place is about 15 to 20 minutes drive from the Baguio City's CBD.This is one of the best museums I have been to. There are a lot of art pieces that you can marvel at. There is also a caf√© where you can try different foods but please do not forget to try their BenCab's Brew (coffee). My favorite part of this place is their farm and garden!
BenCab Museum,"This is where National Artist (national treasure) Benedicto Cabrera ‚ÄúBenCab‚Äù houses his Cordillera art collection. It is in the outskirts of Baguio City, but it is only around 6 kilometers from Burnham Park or about a 20 minute trip by car, taxi or jeepney from the city. The street level gallery is the entry point where entrance fees are paid and brochure with museum map is released with the ticket. More art is displayed at the lower floors. On the bottom level is caf√© ysabel where you step out from the museum building and onto the gardens, pavilion and ponds that await to be appreciated in your visual memories and in your ig feed."
BenCab Museum,Leonard Aguinaldo's work was superb
BenCab Museum,Really cool gallery. Enjoyed my visit here despite the storm.
BenCab Museum,"As I can remember, I am still shook on what I saw in the galleries. BUT!! BENCAB museum is a great place to visit, just be ready on what your eyes will see. ‚ô•"
BenCab Museum,Beautiful scenery and artworks!
BenCab Museum,Showcases works of local artists in its museum.  Guests also have an option to roam around the property with its guided eco trail.  It has its own cafe as well.
BenCab Museum,We always pass by this museum when we are in Baguio.
BenCab Museum,It's a great place to go to when you're in Baguio. Ticket price ranges from 100-180 (forgot the actual price but students get discounted price just present their ID upon entrance)
BenCab Museum,A good place to relax and see a bit of the outdoors. If you are a tourist this is a must see. You get to experience a bit of the culture. They have a good place for a light trek.
BenCab Museum,Perfect for museum dates.
BenCab Museum,"It's a beautiful art museum which I never saw in such an area like in South East Asia. I was positively surprised by the quality of the museum, arts, architecture, structure and environment. If you are in Baguio then you should visit this museum."
BenCab Museum,Ben Cab Museum lives up to the national artist level that tourists exepect. It's beautiful that they also showcase different local artists in their gallery. The location of the museum is not in the route of jeepneys so you really have to ride a cab. Dont worry about getting back to baguio proper since there are people who arrive ridding a cab so you can ride theirs back to baguio proper and the security is courteous enough to assist you in getting a cab. A must see place when you go up  to baguio.
BenCab Museum,This houses the amazing work of arts of one of the Philippine's National Artist Benedicto Cabrera. Nice ambience and good view of mountains and landscapes.
BenCab Museum,You can learn a lot from the exhibit
BenCab Museum,Very nice place showcasing various artist and the mountain province artifacts. They have a very good restaurant too and also offers an hour eco trail hike!. Affordable entrance fee
BenCab Museum,"Peices are great, the crowd isnt. I've been bumped on more than 3 times by people walking backwards taking selfies. Kinda ruined the experience for me. DONT GO ON A SUNDAY!"
BenCab Museum,"The view is mesmerizing. Though, most of the visitors are just there to take photos of themselves with paintings and sculptures. I hope people will spend more time in understanding the arts."
BenCab Museum,Educational but with less displays yet plenty of tourist
BenCab Museum,Good food nice artwork
BenCab Museum,A great place to unwind with your family and by taking a walk there will definitely destresses‚Äã your soul!
BenCab Museum,"It's a homey museum with little farm, garden and restaurant. The mountain tricking is a plus itinerary while inside BenCab.Will bring visitors for sure."
BenCab Museum,"Many awesome reviews about the place so I'll just write about how to get there on public transport. Go visit. It's worth it.About 90 pesos to get there from Session Road in Baguio via taxi. Some charge a contract price. Highest I heard of was 250. I left that taxi and just waited for another.To go back to the city from BenCab, one can either wait for a taxi which is rare or just walk back a little bit maybe 5-10mins and get on a public jeep at St Joseph's Church. Fare is just 11 pesos. There's sometimes a jeep waiting and sometimes you just have to wait for one to come."
BenCab Museum,Nice local art! ‚Ä¶More
BenCab Museum,Wonderful scenery and artworks. The food is delicious as well
BenCab Museum,"Beautiful and educational place. Fare from city through jeepney is just 11 pesos but youll have to walk a bit, it's manageable dont worry."

BenCab Museum,My son loves the pond with the gazebo.. we sometimes spend an hour or so feeding the muktiple koi fishes and a few ducks while seated on the bridge..I love how it celebrates life thru art and nature.
BenCab Museum,You must go here whenever you're in Baguio. ‚Ä¶More

BenCab Museum,It was refreshing to be at the museum. Artworks were one of a kind. I just wish they would have an escalator goiung up. It eas a challenge to walk up four floors.
BenCab Museum,This is more than a museum. Make sure you bring your cameras (or have your phones charged) as tons of instagram-able photos can be taken.
BenCab Museum,"The cabs are very cheap, you can ride a cab from City proper to Bencab and the fare is roughly 90php (depending on the traffic). Good place sans the cafe area where everything is overrated and overpriced."

BenCab Museum,Even non art enthusiasts like me will love BenCab Museum! üòÉI visited BenCab Museum after standing for many hours from the Panagbenga parade. Visitors can surely relax at BenCab Museum.
BenCab Museum,Ben Cab should really be a national artist.  His art encompasses almost all deep sorrows as well as the joys of living.  I envy his passion for nature preservation and making it available as an art.
BenCab Museum,Its a 15 min ride from the city. Great place for people who likes arts. There's a cafe quite expensive but the taste worth the money.
BenCab Museum,"Fusion of art and Cordilleran artifacts. Such a surreal museum. It's a museum with an attitude, a sort of mysterious bite but with a spit of calmness and serenity."

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This place is a aesthetically pleasing for people who have brave hearts. Well, I mean, you know the history. The air near the hotel is somewhat heavy for me and my other friends. But the place as I said is beautiful.I just hope their souls rest in peace and don't mind the visitorsüôÉüôÇü§û"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Last time I went here was October 2019, where you can still go inside the building and climb up to the roof top. As you go inside, you‚Äôll get that eerie feeling. There‚Äôs a fountain in the middle part where it feels so classic and vintage.Now, It‚Äôs 2022 and I went back with my partner. Tourists are no longer allowed to go inside due to the falling debris inside the building and for safety measures. You can still take pictures outside and within the premises. They now have an entrance fee of Php10.00 per head. They are only open up until 5pmFollow to catch up with me and my reviews! ‚úàÔ∏è"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place was a bit crowded when we went in last March 20, 2022. Probably because it's the weekend and the restrictions were lifted. The place kinda gives you a creep but we find it amusing and amazing at the same time. The view is very calming as well and it's nice to take picture almost everywhere. Too bad we cannot go inside anymore not the same as 3 or 4 years ago. Overall we'd love to go back here when it's not that crowded anymore."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Simple and looks like it's ravaged by war kind of ambiance from the movies. Quick visit. Really old style preserved and only the fa√ßade is allowed for pics, can't get in due to renovation. There's entrance of 10 pesos for this outdoor pic. There's a garden nearby to unwind after if you like pine trees.This spot also has snack sellers, a place where you can take a break indeed.If you like old and dated, this is someplace to consider passing-by. Only, it's tough to get a solo pic at lunch time with lots of passers, so come early."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Wanna get spooked?Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden is the new name, Dominican Hill Retreat House as referred to before, to me it is Diplomat Hotel. Diplomat Hotel as it is called in the many TV shows that featured this edifice will scare you for the many elements that live in it.Did we get the vibe? Make a guess.We went here on a rainy afternoon. The rain beat us badly, we got wet. Thanks to the umbrellas that we have, it didn't soak us.Approaching the place made me think twice. I am skittish, jumpy, high-strung, even neurotic sometimes despite having so many horror books I have in my room or no matter how many hundreds of thriller-horror movies I already have watched and ghostly experiences I dealt with years back. So, I almost backed out but I did not. Thanks to my friends who laughed at me.We arrived a little past 5 pm. We paid for the entrance fee and waited patiently for our turn to have our picture taken in every part outside the hotel. Yes, outside the hotel. It is in renovation these days that we can only have a glimpse of this famous structure from the outside.Should I be thankful for that? Well, I guess not very because my heart secretly wanted to get in.Anyway, we meandered in the place for the remaining daylight there is and took photos of whatever we can. We went through a path in the garden and posed many many times for the camera for a souvenir that we braved the Diplomat Hotel. Hey, we loved the pictures by the garden. Braved if you can call it that way. Hey, we loved the pictures taken by the garden. It looked like from a fairy tale land.As for the spooks? Sorry, we didn't experience such. We're outside the building.We'll just go back sometime in the future to get this vibe."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It‚Äôs been a decade before i went back here. More clean and many people becoming more interested in the place. But they don‚Äôt allow people enter the building maybe for safety purposes. I still amazed and grateful to be back    
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Hunted mansion but still very unique. Paid entrance fee of Php10.00. At first glance of the mansion, it looked scary.  It‚Äôs abandoned mansion with some horrifying stories. It has garden at the back and with a nice view of the community and there is another garden with paved walked way adjacent to the front of the mansion is a garden."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Quiet place for prayer but they were cutting trees when we visited. First time buying their Angel Cookies. Sweet but I liked them.There's a small place for candle lighting.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We visited  this place, yet they restricted  you to enter the main hotel due after the earthquake  because  the building  is quite old , and for the safety for all..Entrace fee is 10 pesos for adult and 5 for kids.Operated  by the lgu so quite reasonableOld building full of history.üòÉ üëß my pay, my say  üòä"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It was sooo foggy when we got there around 4pm, feeling you are really in a hunted place üò±. Tourist are no longer allowed inside the building because of the falling debris, but you can take pictures outside of the eerie old building. It was constructed in 1913. You have to pay P10. entrance fee per head and closes at 5pm. You can take your best OOTD as the outside building facade is soo vintage and very beautiful but just be aware there might be a ghost or white lady behind you ü§™üòÇ‚úåÔ∏èüëâ PS: You may watch, like, comment and SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel üòò"" Arlene Aces """
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The small garden at the left side of the Old Diplomat Hotel is worth checking, especially when it's dark. When we went there, the park was serene and no one was there but us. Great place to just sit down ang talk.When we went there Dec 2021, the Old Diplomat Hotel was closed because there were falling pieces of rocks from the wall and ceiling due to a previous typhoon. I hope they renovate and fortify it. The graffiti inside though was a bad choice for me. It took away the historical significance of the building."

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Not worth the hype, at least not at the time of day and when I went. It was very crowded and the building was temporarily closed to walk around inside and get a more creepy feel for this haunted building.We managed to get several nice pictures outside and around the building, and you can have a glance inside some of the opened windows. Maybe a night time experience with a small crowd will make for a better experience, otherwise it was fairly lacking for the 20 minutes or so we spent there."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A very historic and quiet place. Been here twice already. It feels creepy and eerie everytime I go inside as the voices of other visitors slowly fades. However, this place is great for photo ops."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I love the views from the rooftop‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs scanty because of the pandemic.. quite lonely but it‚Äôs a beautiful place for views and pictures. Entrance is php10 for adult and php5 for kids
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This was once a beautiful property. I have had the honors to work here in the 70‚Äôs and was then, the most gorgeous grounds establishment you‚Äôve ever laid your eyes on. The attention to details, from the entrance all the way to the back, was class act!!! It‚Äôs sad to see this place deteriorate. I wish someone would bring it back to its old glory."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Creepy! Cold air coming from inside the place whilst the sun is shining outside. ‚Ä¶More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place is cold. If you like historical places, this is for you."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great place to have bonding with your family and friends.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I visited the place way back in 2017. The place was kinda normal to me, maybe it was because there were lots of people that time. The view was nice, though. I enjoyed my time while we were at the rooftop. I hope they could guard the place better to maintain the beauty of the place, because if I remember clearly, there's vandalism on some parts of the place."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A very nice place to go strolling and breath fresh air since the place is also surrounded by nature. Sometimes there are art exhibits held inside the hotel. It is quite creepy when there are only few visitors. But if there are a lot of people, the place gets very noisy. Go to the roofdeck to get a nice view of the city, and if you're lucky, and the weather is great, you will also see Mount St. Tomas and Mt. Cabuyao."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice hidden gem in Baguio. It's a breath of fresh air so to speak. Something to go to other than the usual go to places of Baguio
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Location: üåüüåüüåü Quite far from the city and the jeepney will only take you halfway. I suggest you take a taxi or bring a private car. Going out is also a problem because it's a secluded place and not many taxis will go up unless they are taking a passenger there. We had to walk for a bit in order to secure a taxi that will take us back to the city.Place: üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü I mean it's a known ghosty area so expect eerie vibes from it haha. Quite cold on the downstairs area, but when we got to the rooftop, it was kind of humid. I didn't know why, considering the whole place was so foggy.I will definitely recommend this for those who are into these kinds of things. But be careful though, you might disturb those who are permanent residents there."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A must-visit place when you're in Baguio, as it has unparalleled views of the city especially during sunset. Just be careful when taking photos as you may end up capturing some eerie images. ü§´"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It is pretty but since we got to go there in morning, it is not that creepy. We had fun strolling here and I love every corner of it. The only thing that I didn't see was the restroom because there's a lot of people that time."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"When you like to have some goose bumps is  Baguio City, this is the place to go,  They say ghosts live here. But I didn't feel anything at all. It was just an old abandoned building overlooking the city. For me it's  a place to relax and feel the coldness of the place. There's a parking space and an entrance fee collected by the city government ."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great for walking and those who want to see historic ruins and garden.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Indeed, history with deep roots is difficult to eradicate. ‚Ä¶More"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"You cannot enter the hotel itself because of safety issues I guess, now its only famous because of the horror stories.But nonetheless you can just take pictures outside.If you're going to visit this when you're in Baguio. Make it least in your priorities. Nothing much to do here"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I rated 5! I'm curious about knowing the unknown. It can be scary but I didn't see anything. ü§£ Maybe because it's morning and there's a lot of people visiting this place at that time. A structural heritage and best place for knowing the history behind what happened to the people who firstly live here. Hope the locals and government preserve the place for the next generation.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Spooky as they might say but very much visited ‚Ä¶More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Love the scary stories of this old abandoned building!‚úîÔ∏è - Parking Area‚ùå - Comfort Roomüòõüòõüòõüòõüòõ - Enjoyable‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Historical (w/goosebumps)           - Ambience ( scary )
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"(Visited last Nov 15, 2022) 10pesos entrance fee per head, only to find out that you can't enter the building.Not worth it to travel and visit until they open it onced again. Visited this place last 2019 with the same entrance fee, but we got to explore the whole area and loaf around the roof deck.Commuter Tip: You can visit this area via Taxi, but when you're ready to leave, you'll have to wait at the gate entrance for another taxi or try GrabTaxi (with an extra booking fee on top of meter fare)."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"You only get to walk around the house, the garden and the long walkway area. It is nice but can be done quickly. We did some photo ops and that was it. ‚Ä¶More"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice place to discover... Eerie for some but I find the place great for seeing Baguio in a much better viewpoint.Quite difficult to go to for some dye to steep roads but it's a great ride :)
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Still a great tourist spot! Diplomat Hotel ‚Ä¶More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Old Diplomat a.k.a ""The Silent Hill"" looks like, especially when the place is foggy.. Perfect for pictorial activities.. Oh by the way, it has also a stunning view of some part in baguio city when you go through to the roof top.. #BoyBagito"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This place is more of a historical structure for me, not that creepy and haunted hotel some people were saying. You can see rooms where guests used to accommodate, fountains (not working and surprisingly, working) and souvenir shop. Above. You can see the lovely view of Baguio. I wish they could bring this building back to life."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Come and visit this place if you need to relax your self from stressful work. I assured you that you can get what you want!!! What are you waiting for? Hurry up!!!
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Somehow gives me creeps. Doors and windows are almost barricaded. An eerie feeling is what you get when looking into its windows. ‚Ä¶More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It's an old historical delapidated building. That's it. The drive going there adds a little bit of a thrill.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Wasn't able to go inside as it's not allowed when we went there. They blocked the entry way. It was creepy. There were a lot of people. Even so a couple doing prenup.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This is our #1 priority attraction from Baguio. The view is good!  Can give you panorama view of Baguio and it was less creepy unlike those documentary videos you've watch. It was worth it.  Very very worth it to visit.  üëåüëåüëåüëå
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,When we went here It‚Äôs close to public for a bit of rehabilitation. I hope the next time we came here we can explore the inside. You can take photo‚Äôs outside tho while it‚Äôs close to public
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Good to drop by and learn its history. The cold and fog certainly adds extra spooky points.Ample parking.Property is now government-owned so both police and military serve as guards.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We really had a good time when we went to Diplomat Hotel. It is a heritage site to behold. The architectural design of the place is fantastic even if you can onlg see the ruins. When you walk along the corridors, it is like you are walking back to time. My first thought was that we are gonna have goosebumps but when we went there, we did not feel anything extraordinary but we felt so amazed. It is open to the public at 6 am until 6 pm. You can bring snacks with you (but you should know how to put your trash on the proper garbage bins). If you wanted to eat, there is also the Hive just beside the old hotel."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice to explore. Not scary as I thought. With the right shot  many corners are insta-worthy.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Nice place..but when we went here, the building was temporary close. Will be back here again."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Although we did not have the opportunity to go inside, we were able to enjoy ourselves outside. This is how you appreciate what you have in life, and we are all grateful for it."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"They say its a creepy place since lots of people lost their lives there. For me, it's merely connecting to our past. While going around the place I keep thinking of how the early generations lived and lost their lives there. Thumbs up to their local government for preserving this ruins in order for the new generations to have a glimpse of the past. üëçüëçüëç"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I love Baguio,so cool to be there,and the cold breeze of air and foggy weather is awesome,üòçHeritage hill and nature are also great for relaxing and peace of mind."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This place is really historical imagining the history behind this hotel where it served as a refuge during World War 2. It's amazing how the walls are still standing and withheld the test of time. The place is at the very end of Dominican hill in Baguio. There are many tourists coming in so no need to be afraid
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,We only have an access outside the site but still we enjoy the place ans the view.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Not all taxi driver know the area, closed this time ( not allow to roam on building) but accept entrance fee at gate, only outside of building"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It's a nice historical place but it needs restoration
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Hard to go, not so scary or non-haunted place. Full of jejemon(fake hypebeast) or high school kids and weird christmas decorations. I really don't appreciate this place. This place doesn't look like haunted building. I just wasted my time there. I really don't recommend this place. 1 star for the view that you can find everywhere in baguio."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We went here during the day and it was a nice place to stroll around. The thing that made it less eerie was all the junk that were lying on the floor like paroles, signages, and other junk. I wish they kept the place as natural asit was."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I've been here twice when I was just in high school. Theirs a lot of improvements in this hotel and also the name was recently change. The garden beside the building is quite a fantasy. It has a variety of plants and colorful flowers. The place was improving its like they are actually reviving the Hotel. Some pictures of the Hotel was hang on the wall so other people can read the history of this place. And my instincts tell me there is a big tunnel under the Hotel. I still believe that this hotel still holds the secrets of the history of the past. Because from what I know this Hotel was a home from a wealthy family up until it became a church then a hospital and becoming a hotel later on. Being a tourist in this place, you'll expect that something weird you'll see or hear scary noise. And some other cases you might smell some nasty stuff. And that means you might be experiencing a paranormal activity. I'll visit again soon to check on this matter."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This is in Baguio, a city where I grew up. This place is part of my childhood. Located amidst trees and top of a hill, this used to be a church then a hotel. Spooky they say it is now a prayer mountain and a tourist spot. Today you still get the eerie when visiting the place. Old stories about being a haunted place still echoes in the city. Good for pictorials too."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Visiting the Diplomat Hotel was on the top of our list and we won't miss it for anything, mainly because of the history of the Hotel and grounds, the death and chaos that surrounds the hotel during the war. Getting in and out of the hotel is not a problem if you have access to the internet and could book a Grab taxi, its quite secluded and no taxis will passed by the hotel, you might need to walk downhill before getting a ride back to the city. We went around the hotel and took some photos first, with the creepy windows and garden, I really enjoyed onld houses and architectural design such as this one. We went at the roof top and waited for quite some time, hoping to catch the sunset but before the sun gone down the guard already asked everyone to leave the hotel, we were the last one to leave the rooftop and when we reached the second level going to the ground the door is already locked and we are trapped, starting to panic since its getting really dark and we are the only ones inside we tried to catch the attention of some visitors that are still outside and the called the guard and finally we got out. We stayed for a while and chat with the guard while waiting for our grab taxi, the guard is really nice and he was  telling us a lot of stories about the place, and they actually dont stay at the hotel, and the reason why they close early is probably because of the huntings. They stayed at the guardhouse by the gate which is very far from the actual hotel and they still hear noises comming from the hotel and still sometimes hear knocking at their guardhouse door. We wanted to stay until night time but it isnt allowed, but he told us that we could stay for the night if we get a permit, some were actually staying for the night and camp at the rooftop with a permit, I dont know how or where to get a permit. There is a toilet and washroom outside the hotel, there is also a spacious parking space."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This was part of my Baguio trip itinerary. They said that this old Diplomat Hotel is considered one of the most haunted places here in the country, to really check if it is true I went there to see it for myself. The ruins of this hotel is now a heritage and nature park, you can see pictures of people who once suffered the harsh punishments during the war, prisoners of war being housed in that place. It was a place of suffering. The place was not maintained well, there was water on the ground floor, it was dripping from the upper level. Some of the stairs are not passable (due to the weak foundation) I hope that they will still maintain the place. It was a very sad and eerie place for me, the remnant of the old world, still standing amidst it's dilapidated state. You can visit the place and see the view on the upper floor (fourth level)... Since I am not from Baguio, ( I am residing in Mindanao) I rented a taxi for 2,000php for six hours, it brought me to different Baguio iconic places, and this Diplomat Hotel is part of that list."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I am a local and I must say that this place still gives me the creeps whenever I go here. Too bad that on my most recent visit, it was too crowded already. Maybe because of the influx of tourist going to Baguio.Nonetheless, if you are looking for a picture perfect memory here in Baguio, Diplomat Hotel is a must visit.Follow me on Instagram:@LimitlessFirstpectiveFacebook Page:LimitlessFirstpectiveYT: Joey Nacario Vlogs"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Nothing scary. Must visit place in Baguio to satisfy your curiousity ‚ò∫Ô∏è Still, the building is old already so one must take extra precaution when shooting photos ."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice place to visit... its historical place..Before its a dominican rest and retreat house then for the refugee and turn to a hotel.. now its historical place you should visit. Open 6am-6pm. Its not that scary place.. more like historical site
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I can't believe I get to take a photo of the place myself. I used to look at the photos from the internet but now I have taken shots of this famous place by myself and I loved it! It's creepy knowing it's history but I loved it!
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Highly recommended for history lovers. This place is creepy. Instagram worthy üòÅ. The place is secured because it has security roaming around. Not recommended for kids. There are available tables and chairs at the ground floor, you can use it if you bring food with you. Just make sure not to leave trash after. Ghost might get mad."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,A beautiful historical building with a horror or scary vibe - sadly can't enter anymore due to some circumstances. People come here to make the church as tiktok backgrounds so maybe you tiktokers can hit the ney ney here and whip it real good. View of the mountain was üëå ‚Ä¶More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It was nice, the creepy feels are still there. Too bas we were not able to see the art galleries. No idea why most of the displays are gone"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Revisited the hotel during the pandemic and it hits different with no tourists bustling along with you. The air is colder and it's like someone's always looking from your back. Haha.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,You‚Äôre no longer allowed in the building anymore. So it‚Äôs pointless to go there. So pointless. ‚Ä¶More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Diplomat hotel one of recommended place to visit in baguio  but at this time you are not allowed to visit inside the building but still hoping to visit after restoration. The largest Ten Commandments is found here it is proven by guinness world record on 2011
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It's a haunted hotel they say. It looks like an abandoned place, you can see from its interiors. Some parts are undergoing renovation already. No entrance fee for this place."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Basically an old burned up building. Went there at about 4pm and it closes at 5pm lol. It looked nice but you not gonna be the only one there.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great scenery in taking photos to remember.  üíö‚ù§üíú
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This building should retain its history but not sure what happened why it looked like it became an art exhibit. I do love art but it should be in a proper place. The place has been known for his haunting stories and it would have retain its appeal if not because of the paintings. It looked like it was vandalised but on a good way.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It is not about the ghost, Old Diplomat Hotel is about our rich history and looking back about the suffering happened in the past. It was all written in our history. We may not have  contribution in the past, but remembering the souls of those unknown can help them to live at peace in the next life. Let's value the life offered here."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The Old Diplomat Hotel and used to be a Dominican Seminary. Rich with history and ghost stories. They have renovated the place already and now it looks livelier. The top of the building is good for 360¬∞ view of Baguio. Just don't forget to make ""pagpag"" after visiting this place. Lol"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This is a cool historical place. It's a bit creepy but if you're like me who's a bit excited about the creepiness of such a place this will be a good one. Not just the creepiness who will just attract you to visit the place but also the history behind it. And if you will have the chance to go upstairs it will give you an awesome view of Baguio City.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We went here to take some photos around 5pm, and this place is creepy. When you enter the main door a few steps you would feel that someone is watching you. There is only one main light inside. Recommended for ghost hunting activity and guys if you want a to have a scary experience I recommend that you visit this place. This place is open from 6AM to 6PM."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This place is amazing another good place to visit when you're in Baguio.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"They say it's one of the haunted place in Baguio City the reason I was very curious to visit. But since everyone heard about it, a lot of people are already flocking the area especially on weekends and holidays. I did not see any ghosts, however, I enjoyed the tour because of its rich history and architecture. A must visit for old stuff enthusiasts."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Its so cool place hahah
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I love the view and the vibe of the place
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Not worth going!! Don‚Äôt waste your time here! Half the park is fenced off by the groundskeepers. Not sure if they just made the back house their residence or what? ‚Ä¶More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The building  still standing but they're not allowing people to get inside the building.. pay parkint lang babayaran..
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I love the story behind this old diplomat hotel
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Cool! Very busy site... Got a good view of baguio
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Lots of tourists lately. You can't feel the ""scary vibe"" inside no more unless you go at night üòâ Still no entrance fees so it's a go-to place for backpackers."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Building is temporarily closed for renovations. If you're wondering there are no food stalls, but you can bring your own food, and there's comfort rooms too!"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"As soon as you enter the gate, there's this vibes that would tell you it's haunted. I wasn't that scared too much since there were a lot of people when we came but I can tell that some rooms had creepy vibes. We roamed all over the place and the building was very old as hell lol. Each rooms has it's own story to tell. I suggest going there past 4PM if you want to give your visit a thrill. üíÄ"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A historical place/building.Rich in story.In the morning or afternoon, it's not that scary. It's look like a place for overlooking or meditation.On the right side when you fronting the lobby, it is closed and renovated exclusive for meetings etc etc.On the left side, that's the place where you can start a short walk up to the roof top.Too many rooms to explore.No entrance fee.They have a parking area.6am-6pm"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Eerie and beautiful. This place offers a nice view of Baguio City as well. Explore the area and go into each nook and cranny.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice place to visit. Overview of the capital. Free entrance. Free parking.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A great historical place, well maintain and well protected, quite and clean, should not missed this place if your visiting Baguio."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Also called the Diplomat Hotel. Previously an old church seminary, camp during the war,  then a converted hotel, and now a haunted (?) or heritage building of the city. An old ruin with some partial renovations. A good 360¬∞ view of Baguio City. Entrance is free."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The place is still amazing tho visitor's are not allowed to enter the building anymore. :(
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Main building is currently closed due to falling debris and you only get to see the outside part of it.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Spooky and cold.. nice exploration for this historical haunted building.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,You can't enter but it's good to experience it if you haven't.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,creepy tho great view on the rooftop IG worthy
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Free entrance and good for picture taking, although expect lots of photobombers. If you fascinate abandoned places,  this is a must-go. I just wish the history of the place were written somewhere so guests will have an idea."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Nice place, creepy, but people love to take photo"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"An eerily beautiful building located in Baguio City. It has an entrance fee of ‚Ç±10 and parking charges. As of writing this review, people aren't still allowed to enter the building due to falling debris, but the place is still worth the visit!"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The rooftop view is pretty good and the history of the place is quite interesting. Not spooky enough imo.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This is one of the tourist attraction in baguio. One can ride a jeep or taxi to get to the place.   Aside from the old diplomat hotel and its horror stories, you can also find the big 10 commandments and ark of the covenant.It is best to visit in the early in the morning or late in the afternoon. The guard is also very accomodating and tells you stories of the place."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Got nice view of the old building. A bit creepy  but full of history.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Scary but super enjoy
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The view is scenic and panoramic. There are a lot of pine trees so it is a nice place to relax. You can view the city proper from the top of the old building. At the top you can see the beauty of it's former glory. You can see a lot of tourist coming in. It is accessible thru taxi transport and jeepneys(just one ride from city proper) . I bring my friends and they are amazed by it's view.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The fog adds scariness to it. Did got some unusual feelings though at the first few minutes in the ""hotel"", the climate was very low yet i was sweating as hellüòñ"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Old diplomat hotel. Nice place to visit ‚Ä¶More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,When you went to Baguio you should try to visit it. It can give you thrills in visiting it.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The place doesn't have an entrance fee and there's available parking space both inside and outside of the area. The place is not really that special because it wasn't maintained properly as well. Just the wishing well ia nice.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Beautiful place. Great view! It's ironic that the most haunted and the most scary place in Baguio has the most beautiful view! 360 degrees of Baguio is what you can see once you get to the roof deck. (I think this is the coldest place too, the fog adds to the eerie-ness of the place) 100% recommend, must see!"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"this place is so beautiful in the morning but creepy at the afternoon, perfect location for photo shoots :) and there's no entrance fee once you visit the historical diplomat hotel the only thing you do is to log your name when you enter , one of my favorite places in Baguio."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The Dominican Hill Retreat House, also commonly known as the Diplomat Hotel, is an abandoned structure atop Dominican Hill, Baguio, Philippines. It is now undergoing rehabilitation through the efforts of the city government."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Went here a few years ago. The Building has probably witnessed so many tragic events that one can feel how sad the place is.Something weird happened here also, my friend took pics here of us and 2 pics turned out distorted! First time to witness and see those kind of pictures in my life. Place also Scary as if someone watching you."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"2nd time being here last Oct. 27, 2019. Love to take pictures, it is open until 5pm."

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great for photo ops enthusiast whether a beginner or pro.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Spooky at first, but you'll feel the history of that place. Just don't think about anything since that place is crowded until past afternoon."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great place.. preserved historic building
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It wasn't spooky, nice ruins though. I can totally imagine what it could have been if they continued it"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"You'll hear a lot of scary stories about this place so I really don't want to visit this place but when we arrived here, there are a lot of tourist roaming the whole place! The whole place is rich in history and you'll be in shock knowing what really happened to some people during the Japanese occupation in the country."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I love Diplomat Hotel! Im glad that its open to public for free. Perfect place to shoot.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Get your own goosebumps üòÅüëåüèª
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It will make you curious to visit with the history and ghost story this place holds.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Unforgetable Tourists' spot in Baguio City.... indeed mystical
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Its nice to visit
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,A very beautiful place though not well maintained. Hopefully they could remove the parapernalies from festival because it looks like a warehouse..
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Not advisable to visit if you are easily scared. We didn't go inside because it is prohibited when we visit.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,One of the well known tourist spots in Baguio. Place now have different paintings for attraction.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,A building with a historical background and now infamous for being one of the most haunted places in Philippines.A must visit if in Baguio city.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,3 stars to give way to improvements especially proper preservation of historical buildings and other artifacts. ‚Ä¶More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Eerie yet beautiful abandoned structure worth visiting for... Great view atop Dominican Hill Baguio.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Explore the old Diplomat hotel with its picturesque facade but don't let your imagination run wild!
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Open for public but the inside of the building itself is not Open. You can only take pictures outside.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"OLD BUILDING, CANNOT ENTER INSIDE. VERY HISTORICAL"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Good place to see more of Baguio. Kinda give you chills when you went up to the second floor. Haha
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"My family and I have a great time exploring this place. I love the greenery, the flowers, the butterflies. The hotel ruins bring a chill to the atmosphere.üòÅ"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Thought it would be scarier,  but not.  Any way,  my boyfriend and I enjoyed the viewüòä"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Majestic and educational. These are the two words that can describe this place. I really loved the way they restored and enhanced some parts of the hotel. Kudos to all of the management and to the City of Baguio.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The review is for the Old Diplomat Hotel. OK to visit just once. It takes just about 5 mins to go around the area and that‚Äôs it. To be fair, entrance and parking fee is cheap. P5 for adults, children are free, parking at p35.The building is, well, old and dilapidated and I guess has the haunted house charm.  To be fair, the area is kept clean - it doesn‚Äôt smell like pee and you won‚Äôt see pop lying around.The surroundings of the building are very much alive with trees, flowers and greenery.If you‚Äôre pressed for time on your visit to Baguio - not a place I would recommend to see because really, there isn‚Äôt much to see üòÑ"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Cool place (literally). It's good but not maintained properly. Also, no functioning comfort room when I went there."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Historic building, quite spooky , creepy üëª"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nice old place
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A must go place for people who love horror and mystery. Easy to find a taxi to take you there, but you have to be patient to wait for a taxi that will take you back to the city."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Very historic and creepy place to visit in Baguio. A good place to visit if you want to see Baguio City top view
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Not much to see here, went Feb '19 and no art installations, just a packed dilapidated building. Garden outside was ok, views from this height are great though."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,imagining how magnificent this place is before.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Very beautiful place despite its eerie history, too bad the indoors are temporarily off limits to visitors due to the damage caused by typhoon Maring. There's no entrance fee before but now you have to pay but only for a small price (which I hope they will use to maintain and retrofit the area). You can still stroll the graden area and take pictures with beatiful nature views."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Better coming here as a group with private car as commuting going back to city proper is a challenge.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This place has become a joke already. When this place was virtually unknown to the outsiders in the 90's, it was a mystery and really spooky.   But now, it is just another tourist trap."

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,View from old Diplomat Hotel ruin.

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Very historical
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Deifinitely the rich history of the structure will capture your curiosity.  One of the best place to get a beautiful look at the scenic landscape of baguio.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I've been to Baguio City umpteen times but it was my first time to visit Diplomat Hotel with my officemates for a weekend getaway last December 8, 2018. It's an abandoned place, a bit creepy in  some areas but it offers some historical knowledge. Go for it, it's worth your time"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,a nice place to see the old buildings still standing
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It's interesting to see, but I would have liked more information for tourists about what the building is and why people believe it's haunted"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Mini park behind Diplomat Hotel.

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Nothing unusual about the place, has a good viewing deck, sadly weren't able to go inside since its prohibited"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A little creepy, but overflowing with history... You can feel the ghost of the past and war here"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place is normally closed to the public after 4:30 PM. But we were able to enter the building as part of the Pine City Fright Tours. It was our last stop. As it is, the place is already scary as hell at night. But learning about its history made it so much more frightening. It was thrilling but I'm not sure it is something I'd like to do again."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I had the chance of going there while there was a painting and photo expo + a lyric singing concert! The atmosphere was amazing!The house in itself is pretty impressive also. So go there! You never know what you might stumble upon :)
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Scaring? No.. more or historical...
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A historic site. Has a nice view of the city.  Roof access no longer available as of this writing. Possibly for safety reasons. Views would have been better there. Site and building could use better maintenance and upkeep. ""Strategic"" restoration of certain sections would be awesome, making the site last longer and look a lot better."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Awesome place to visit, better than expected"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,its good to be here
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This place lives up to its name: heritage. There's a different feeling when you get there. It's creepy and at the same time amazing because it takes you back in time when you still do not exist. The historical photos displayed inside are really awesome.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Best place to walk.I used to walk there from home every Friday morning and stayed there a whole day.Although it get 2hours to walk from home to get in this place, but after that it's worth it.It's a beautiful place. Peaceful. Out from this air pollution from the car in the city.Very nice place."

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Jampacked with tourists but the place is really nice.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A haunted hotel in Baguio,"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place is hauntingly beautiful but the tourists are really a turn-off. They have been told not to stand on high ledges and yet, they still do it. The entrance is free and you can get great photos! Another thing we noticed are the vandalism on some walls. I hated the EJK signs because, cmon, even here?!"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A must go tourist destination. Feel the chilling vibe of the old diplomat hotel. According to sayings, this place is haunted. Place is not crowded. Securities are present within the area. The view is overlooking some place in Baguio City. Unfortunately building is not well maintained and damages can be seen in the structure which add to its haunted vibe"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Not that scary as says in news and some people. I'm looking for a ghost but i saw nothing. I think it is because of the renovation of the place. This place is good for photoshoot. I hope it can bring back the scary feeling of the hotel when I go back to this place. Great tourist attraction. Thumbs up for thisüëçüëç
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Quite crowded in the morning. Due to the volume of people, the ambience of the supposed to be creepy place was gone,. Maybe the place will be different by afternoon or evening. Will go back to check on a different time. Nonetheless, the place is beautiful. The view from the top is amazing."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Nothing special but an old ruined building
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The building is temporary closed. Entrance fee should've been free since the main attraction is not really accessible.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Definitely worth to visit! The view is really nice. We walked from the intersection to the diplomat. The road was elevated so it can be quite tiring.  Didn't see anything tho, but you can feel the heaviness upon entering the place. Can't quite explain it üòÖ"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,10 Pesos Entrance and 35 pesos for Parking.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,closed. you can only view from the outside window.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Best to visit 2pm-4pm before it closes.  Better to visit also during lean days para you can enjoy the creeps of being alone.  Lol
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great architecture on top of a hill. You'll have goosebumps once you get in.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"An abandoned seminary school built in 1913, it is also called Diplomat Heritage Hill and Nature Park. It was converted into hotel by Diplomat Hotel in 1973 but closed when its manager/owner died. The roofdeck of the building provides a 360 degree view on Baguio City. A great place for reconnecting with Baguio's history and lots of photo ops for photography buffs. Paranormals believe to be  a haunted place due to its brural past during World War II. But you got to find out for yourself."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Really appreciate the structure of the building.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place has changed so much since I've last been here.Gone was the creepy, foreboding and gloomy Heritage hotel. They host events and extremely remodeled the place that the hotel no longer offers the thrill.All you can do now, is drop by and take some pictures. Too many tourists drop by now and I think they all scared the ghosts away. Hehe"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,We were not able to go inside the bldg. Said they have restricted it because the structure already has a weak foundation and might cause unwanted accidents.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We visited the place on a night time. We joined the security on their rounds. The inside had a still air. We took some pictures and they showed images rarely found in a normal picture. There were children, nuns and a friar in the photos we took. Or these were just products of our imagination."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Scary Diplomat Hotel at night ‚Ä¶More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,just an old bldg with nature. nothing so special
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Pretty much an old building where a lot of young people have photo shoots üòÇ I enjoyed reading a little about it‚Äôs history however it would be great if there were guided tours or even ghost tours around this place. The roof of the building has great view of the whole city so that was pretty much the best part of my visit.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Interesting place. We've just visited awhile ago at around 5pm and there's not much people, we'd taken pics as much as we want."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Weekdays, best day to visit the place to enjoy the arts and ambiance :)"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Added a hint of wxcitement to our baguio trip. The place is apooky and will give you the creeps
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,See different kinds of house here.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,you can see beautiful view from the top of the building:)
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Would be such a lovely place if it did not suffer from poor maintenance and sanitation. There is a strong smell of urine every where you walk in the building. The structural steel supports in the concrete suspending the 1st floor is rusted and subject to structural failure. I saw the exposed steel and left the building.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Awesome
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Although the dilapidated state of the building brings in that haunted vibe to which this historical site is known for, it would be nicer if there is ""life"" added to this historical place. Still a good place to visit for those who wants to know more about the history of baguio or for those who wants to feel the ""hauntedness"" of the place."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Amazing place to tour around
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A heritage place that has great potential to teach history, but the historical content of the structure need to be searched, collected, and curated. The government oversees, but it is apparent rebuilding and maintenance need funding. Hoping here for benevolence and public support."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Interesting place to visit, the history about it is very extensive with many strange and horrid happenings. Currently in a restoration phase which is great."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Just ordenary old hotel , nothing to do aside from that just the history itself."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"I LOVED IT REALLY. So many spots where u can take pictures to post in ig. Im an aesthetic and meticulous instagram narcissist and I assure you that it is recommended. Especially to those who wants vintage and dark feeds. You can roam around the ruins of the hotel and the garden. Gosh i loved it there. I would have given four stars because we exhausted ourselves getting there since we went by foot but nah, I considered the place in general."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This place deteriorated from the last time I visited it around 2 years ago. What's new are the art pieces on some of the walls that looks out of place.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It's been a long time since i last visited this place..
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The only thing that I like about diplomat is the exterior design (plus the windows.) They're renovating I think half of the building which flooded some of the rooms. It is famous for its scary stories and people being possessed, maybe that's why a lot of people go there? Ps. It is so hard to take pictures without photobomberü§´"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The place is not that scary but haunting. Efforts are already been placed for the repairs of the building
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,At the moment you can't enter the hotel ‚Ä¶More
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We had so much fun there. Someone said to me that once you go visit  the diplomat hotel, some spirits or ghost will follow you, haha but that's not true. The place has so many nice spots to take pictures."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Creepy
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Now the newest art hub in the city. Come and commune with nature or just admire the art works on display for the First Baguio Creative Festival. You'll enjoy yourself either imagining things that you think you saw or just taking in the sights.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Creepy it is but there's more of a horror stories about this hotel.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It's not that creepy and the view on top is amazing. Must visit place in baguio.

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,We are not allowed entry inside. üò≠
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Considered as one of the most haunted place in the country. Yeah! I'm convinced. I saw a white misty figure coming out from the main entrance. I wasn't frightened but amazed. üòÆüëªüèöÔ∏è
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Also known as Diplomat Hotel.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Great experience to visit Diplomat Hotel. Not scarry since we visited at around 9 or 10 am and a lot of people there were exploring the place

We should all pray for the souls that rested here."

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Its a quiet yet  eerie place...visit on weekdays because not alot of people visit the place but they do visit on weekdays and the place would be crowded.you need to have a car or rent a taxi because the place is out of jeepney lines and they wont bring you directly at the hotel,you will have to walk the rest if that is the case but if you rent a taxi you dont have to walk."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Love this place very serene
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Diplomat Hotel, as it's most popularly called, is known for its derelict appearance and ghost stories. In recent years, the city government has made efforts to improve it and develop it as a heritage site, complete with art exhibits and useful historical facts. However, with each new enhancement, the place becomes more and more an actual hotel, slowly shedding off its source of infamy."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I like the old ruins and the view on top
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,One of the heritage places in baguio you must visit

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It's a good place to visit and really gives you the creeps but it also gives you a historical sense which is really good
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Most people go here with the objective of finding ghosts. There are so many people who go here so it isn't as eerie as you expect it to be. Maybe visit during rainy days or foggy days for the full experience?

Located in city of Baguio or known as summer capital of the Philippines.It used to be a vacation house and a seminary way before it was developed into a school and eventually, a hotel.According to some residents in the area and caretaker, there are the spirits of nuns and priests who were beheaded during the war. Exploring its quiet and gloomy passages will give you chills and goosebumps.#olddiplomathotel #revisiting #baguio #travelthrowback #haunted #abandoned #fountain #travelph #travelphotography #gopro #photoofthedayFollow IG: jay291350"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Lot of unnecessary drawings and writings on the wall. Hope the local govt here will still restore the history on that place
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This building is truly beautiful. The structure and it‚Äôs architectural design is really interesting. You can still see the old bricks and still feel the coldness inside.I would love to stay longer but due to the massive number of tourist visiting the level of excitement went down, it‚Äôs pretty sad that they‚Äôre everywhere shouting and running here and there.I think the best time to visit the place is around 8am it‚Äôs solemn and for sure you will enjoy the calmness of the Diplomat Hotel."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A bit scary place, much creepy. Some part of the building has nasty smell though."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"... The place is maintained,  though there are some rooms filled with debris. The second floor is closed and under renovation.  All and all good for it's very historical..."

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This is one of our favorite places to visit in Baguio. There's no entrance fee and although it is not pretty accessible from the city via commute (less you opt to ride a jeepney then walk some five minutes instead of hailing a cab or bringing a car), it's an amazing spot to see fog and pine trees on top of the infrastructure ruins (hopefully not some ghosts)."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place was renovated, they added a glimpse of the history of the place. The largest tablet of the ten commandments is also located here."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,love the view and chilling experience.

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The ruins of the old retreat place is really eerie but still you feel a solemn vibe overall

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"When I found out that we will be going to the Old Diplomat Hotel I really got excited. I just love visiting old historical places. And this building intrigue me from the stories I heard.This hotel sits on top of the Dominican Hill with a panoramic view overflooking the city of Baguio. There are a lot of tourist when we got there. I believe this place is the first on their list when they visit Baguio.Inspite of the stories I heard I was more fascinated than scared because the hotel is beautiful even in ruins and decay.  I find the atmosphere of this abandoned place fascinating and delightful.  I felt going back in time imagining  about the people who used to walk through that halls and slept in the now empty rooms. I imagined how beautiful and grand it was during that time.Most of all the place is really good for photo shoot. There  are a lot of spots inside the building such as broken windows, eerie  walls, and the famous fountains which makes a great backdrop. At  the rooftop you can have a photo overlooking the picturesque view of the place."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,A must visit in Baguio City. Food is available in the area for a minimal cost.

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"According to the history, it used to be a vacation house of a seminary, it was established by the Dominicans, so the place was called DOMINICAN HILL. Now it is one of the most haunted abandoned hotel in the world, because of the World War II (WWII)."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,If your looking for something different the Diplomat Hotel is worth checking out. It's known to be one of the most Haunted places in Philippines and the day we decided to go planned out perfectly there was a very heavy fog that day so it made the hotel more creepy looking and just walking through it there was an eerie feel to it. I recommend it to be one of ur stops whenever ur in Baguio

Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,too sad the entire building is no longer allowed for people to enter
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Last 2019 was quite memorable for me because I finally got to visit one of places that I used to watch on paranormal shows and documentaries. It has a sad (and brutal) history, and to see the old, decrepit building in person was solemn and eerie; quite a contrast to the beautiful garden right outside.I've heard that there has been a few changes (or restrictions) since then, nevertheless, if you're in Baguio, this site is a must-see."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This is a beautiful area and worth seeing, however I do wish there was a way to restore the old church back to its original state. We spent a couple of hours here looking inside the church from the outside. This church sits quietly on top of a small mountain. There were venders there and I tried yam ice cream for the first time. This is worth a visit for sure."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A century ago, the Dominicans built a holiday and study home on a hill. The house, which had many vicissitudes during the war, was renovated into a 'Diplomat Hotel' after the war, an imposing building with a square plan.After a fire with the dead it was abandoned, in the smell of ghosts.Now, it is among the attractions that are managed by the municipality, with a beautiful garden.You pay a 10 peso ticket."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"When we went he was close I don't know why but the building is still the building and its beautiful as it is. We didn't just go inside, we were just outside taking pictures around the building. He has no entrance fee, he is free. He is also close to Lourdes Grotto, so it is also convenient to visit 2 tourist spots immediately."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It is forbidden to go inside due to falling debris. The climb is steep. It's okay to go in the afternoon when it's less crowded.Nothing special. It looks like a normal old building.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I hope it's ok if I can come in haha. We would have gone ghost hunting in case the building was closed and no entry was allowed. All tourists just outside. We paid for parking and entrance fee though
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The time we went there the building was closed. You cannot go inside the building because of falling debris. I hope they have a way to prevent this from happening so they can go inside.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The area is scary especially when it rains but it's still a best experience you must visit during baguio time .. BOOK NOW Highly recommended @Lakbay Tourismo Travel and Tours
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The place is clean and the entrance is affordable. P10 for parking and P10 pesos for entrance. Although you can't go inside anymore. You can only take pictures outside.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The view is beautiful. When we went, it wasn't open. The hotel diplomat was not allowed to enter the building. Someone was throwing rocks."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The building is now closed but you can still enter the vicinity. Make sure when you go up and you don't want to walk down, you have a car"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,not much to see. it is forbidden to enter the ooob
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,One of the places you have to visit when you are in Baguio. It is often used in shows and movies that are scary. M
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"üòáüòçIt's scary being alone here hahahah, this place is also beautiful"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"As of June 2022, it is no longer possible to enter the interior due to falling debris. You can only go around outside and in the garden."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"It can only be viewed from the outside, so it's worth going for a walk. Go if you have a lot of time. It's not worth going."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,This place feels heavy. A bit eerie and creepy. The place is well guarded and has a fully functional cr. The parking space is also ok.You can bring pets like chihuahua but not the big dogs.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Idk but this is my fav place in Baguio because the view here is perfect. Feeling european. haha
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"There really is a ghost.,. But if you put your fear before going there, you will be really scared and you will feel their presence.,. But if you go there, just think that the diplomat is like this and don't think if there is a ghost watching or not.,.There were some changes when we went last time.,. The photos of the monks and nuns were removed from a corner of the hotel.,. It was the second time I went and I didn't feel that anyone was following or watching unlike the first time,.,.Careful maybe in taking a picture with the mindset that ""it's okay if there's a ghost to be photographed"" seems like a challenge,., Just take a normal picture like a vacationer.,.Every part of the hotel is beautifully photographed. Especially when it's foggy.. highly recommended for Baguio visitors"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Chill plus creepy vibes .. If you know history .. Hehe better go there in the afternoon for exciting haha
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Do not enter inside
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,There is no point in going here either. You can't go inside either. There are also no seats and hangouts. Even the theater is still closed.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place is beautiful! They say it's very scary, but it's very beautiful here at the Diplomat Hotel"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Very eerie feeling at Diplomat Hotel. When we went we were not allowed to go inside until we were just outside. 35 pesos is the parking fee and 10 pesos is the entrance fee (adults) and 5 pesos for children.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,CreepyliciousSolemn..nice view at the rooftop..the glass looks like there's a nun but of course that's just a mischievous imagination
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,No demons :((
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Fantastic nature path. Pine trees. Nice chill. Silence. Relaxation.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,nice and clean so the building itself is closed and I hope they can improve their CR but it's clean nmn
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"If you're looking for a place to scare yourself this is not the place, the ghosts have left and the crowds are crowded every day ... As of today they don't open and can enter right inside the hotel, you can round and paid I forgot howmuch ..."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"A hotel built during the Spanish colonial days before 103, and a war broke out in this place between the two places and the Philippines on one side, and the Japanese on the other."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"very beautiful place, you climb on the rooftop very romantic view üòç"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"You are not allowed to go inside yet, but it looks like it is being renovated"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Amazing place, historical, pretty uplifting"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"My family enjoys the place, please visit me momo daw"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Only 2 stars because the ghost didn't show up
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Hmmm, a place the locals should visit"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,The view is beautiful.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Nice place, if it's closed, they're poor ghosts who come out to scare diplomats outside, because people are not allowed inside"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"First of all, the road to get here is a bit confusing especially if you use Waze or Google Maps. We were taken to a remote place but we also found the way to it. Just follow the road signs.Second, the place is beautiful and the scenery especially on the roof of the Dominican Hotel. You can't feel the vibes when there are a lot of people, especially during the holidays when people flock. Try to go during hindi holidays so you can feel the old vibes here.Lastly, you can learn not only about ghosts here. You can see important information and history here because there is information posted on the walls."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,I will come back when I have time üòÖ nice...
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Under maintenance so not inserted inside. Bawi nalang next life.
