Burnham Park,"An excellent place for family and friends to visit. It has no entrance fees, and has a lake where you can ride a boat (P 150) and park grounds where you can ride small bikes (P 100). Not a place I would recommend at night as it gets quite dark here at some spots. But the morning is a superb experience you will definitely want to come back to."
Burnham Park,"A lovely place to be on a nice day.We were pleasantly surprised and very pleased at how long a period of time that we had aboard our boat on the lake.You may hire bicycles(some carrying as many as three people)on the cycle track for a modest fee,and once again the period of time allowed is most generous indeed ~ so it is good value for money.Spend time here is amazing. I love the place."
Burnham Park,"Definitely one of the best places to visit in Baguio. üíñ Burnham Park is a crowded tourist destination, but for good reason. The assortment of flowers that you will see in the park is truly breathtaking.Aside from sightseeing, you can also do boating, have your picture taken by a photographers' cooperative in tribal clothes, rent cars or bikes, and play at the amusement park."
Burnham Park,I have always been looking at this park ever since 2018. I only had the chance to review the park because I flexed the view of this park to my Japanese friend so that he can go here someday. Still crowded as ever. There's a lot of tourist as always. It is still fun to see everyone having fun here.
Burnham Park,Very beautiful park with boating and cycling available inside the park. Good place to relax and have clean air. Whenever I visit Philippines I make sure to visit Burnham park each time.
Burnham Park,A lot cleaner and crowd is more manageable more than ever. Police presence is constant so you feel more safe. More public CR are around and increased number of evenly spread out trash bins. Just make sure you do your part and clean as you go.
Burnham Park,Bring something to protect you from the heat of the sun when going up in this place. family vehicles are not  allowed to go up to this point because the area where you will see a good view of the tower and the west Philippines sea is not wide enough  for vehicles. tricycle fare per trip is 50 pesos as of 2022 with a maximum of 3persons per trip.
Burnham Park,"I/we enjoyed Burnham Park. We visited when it was busy and mellow, day and night. Felt safe. Numerous low level things to do for all ages. Fun to see nostalgic things to do (bumper cars, bike/pedal rentals) all sorts of food vendors, even massage people (but not sure where that happens).We had a picnic and someone offered (and we bought) blue tarp to sit on.Recommend and would return but wouldn‚Äôt call it a must see.Parking is hard to come by so walk or get dropped off is key."
Burnham Park,"Burnham Park is considered to be one of the most famous parks in the country. It is located on Jose Abad Santos Drive, Baguio City 2600 Benguet Philippines. A park is a popular place for both locals and tourists. This place is often full-packed with people regardless if it is rainy or not. The most well-known activity in the park is ‚Äúbiking‚Äù. There are lots of bicycles for rent at a very decent price. It is an excellent activity for youngsters and adults."
Burnham Park,"The place was also nice to see in the morning especially trying activities a family can enjoy like biking, riding a boat and having picnics. There are food area and lots of rest rooms. Parking is just hard during peak season. (Forgot to take pics since we just visit first in the evening for the night market üòä). The night market is beside the park."
Burnham Park,The best place to have a relaxing time after a long day or week. Most especially on a really nice weather. Have a sit in one of the benches around the park while sipping your freshly brewed coffee or any fave beverage. This is a not to miss place. Free and worth it!
Burnham Park,"Very busy during daytime, glad that we are almost back to normal now. Bikes, Tricycle, boat, etc. for rent are very affordable/cheap. Just the right price. Clean area minus the color of the lake's water."
Burnham Park,"A great place for a trip with your family, friends and your partner!-There are available paddle boat operators that you can rent from 200-350 pesos.-Bikes can be rented from 75 pesos up to 150 pesos that is already good for 30 minutes.Location is strategic. There are several walking distance establishments where you can eat and jeepney vehicles are just nearby."
Burnham Park,I love walking around baguio especially at Burnham Park because you can see a lot of flowers around the park. You can also do many recreational activities like biking and riding a boat. They also have food stalls once you got hungry! This park is also near markets.
Burnham Park,"one of our favorite places in Baguio. Unfortunately, only those checked-in or with membership are allowed to visit. they have golf and other sports activities, great food, activities for children, clean and spacious rooms, and very near to camp john hay."
Burnham Park,Burnham Park is a good place to stroll both night and day. There are paid parking lots around the area you have to pick the area where you will be staying for a long time to prevent longer walks.We took the boating at night and it is more beautiful and silent than in the morning. We paid ‚Ç±150 for the boat plus additional ‚Ç±50 because we were tired to row the boat.We wanted to try roller skates but it was already closed at 7PM. The bump car was the other ride we were able to try it was ‚Ç±100/5 mins/head and with a weight limit.
Burnham Park,Big park with plenty of space to do a variety of activities offered by the park or on your own. Many restrooms situated around the park as well as food stops. Not many restrooms open when it gets dark. Not sure I've seen many trash bins but the park seemed to be well maintained from garbage
Burnham Park,The park offers a lot of activities and is well known for the boat ride. You may choose what you want to do there and enjoy the weather while doing your activities.
Burnham Park,"Things to do around Burnham Park are:- Have a boat ride in the lake- Rent a bike to ride around- Walk around the park- Eat local food- Learn a little about history of the place.NOTE: There are locals who would suddenly stand near you and sing a song and ask for donation. It is up to you if you would give them. There are also locals who will offer you a massage for Php100.00.At weekends, it can be crowded. If you want a much quiet time, go on weekdays.There is a night market that pops up beside the park. It's a whole street of people selling products such as souvenirs, shirts, jackets, and a separate area for food."
Burnham Park,"Always iconic üåª Haven't been here for so long despite my distance, but it's due to some busy schedules and some usual distractions. Indeed, if you wanna ponder over things and genuinely cry while walking down the park like I did this early morning. Early as 4, 5 or 6AM is perfect if u wish for a wider space & less people. Meeting joggers too on the way pictures a healthy environment while the cold breezy wind dances.Tired now, benches are free, yet cold ha-ha!Burnham Park is üíû"
Burnham Park,It's a nostalgic visit for me. There you still have the man made lagoon where tourist can go on boating. There's these biking & cart area where kids & children alike can while away time waiting for their elders. Not far off is the market where fresh produce can be bought & taken as pasalubong.
Burnham Park,"Great park for a walk. In the middle you can rent a boat for a boat riding around P200 for 30 mins. On the upper part there was an amusement park with skating rink and or you can rent a bike, price depends on what bike youll rent. Overall its an enjoyable place with the family."
Burnham Park,"Had we arrived during day time, we would have relished the beauty of Burnham Park to the brim. We visited there late in the evening, but we still captured the spirit of fun and calmness that this park had offered to us. Thank you people of Baguio City. Your Burnham Park is superb!"
Burnham Park,"Gone are the glory days of this park but still the local government find ways to improve the park to be more attractive to local tourist you can paddle boat ,bike ,take a picture and taste of strawberry Taho  and Also nkt forget the cold weather"
Burnham Park,"This place is iconic and sits at the heart of the city. No Baguio trip is complete without this stop as a staple.Upside: there are lots of activities you can do in this park, including boating, biking, and skating. Early in the morning, there are also different workout groups you can join (Zumba, Tai Chi, etc) At night, Harrison Street is closed for the pop-up night market. There are nice policemen helping out with directions and making sure there are no peddlers. You can have a picnic here. Every street that surrounds the park has enough going--food places, souvenir shops, ukay stores, gas station. Name it. Easy to get taxis too.Downside: when in Baguio always keep your purse in front of you. Their streets are known for petty thefts. This last trip during the pandemic we felt safer and more relaxed. Restrooms are old, they aren't that clean. You have to pay up and some cubicles are squat toilets. Just do your numbers back where you're staying.Do we recommend this place? Yes.Are we going back? Yes."
Burnham Park,"Since we came there late at night, obviously I can no longer make a detailed review of the place. Anyways, from where we sat down, I still can see the beauty of the lake. There are still a lot of people going to and from my bench. Expectedly, the place is cold. Too bad I don't have anyone with me to cuddle. Hahahaha. Will be visiting the place again soonest I will be back in Baguio."
Burnham Park,"A place for the family and groups of people. It has everything from entertainment to relaxation, from skating rinks to bikeways to fun rides and food. Parking is quite difficult to come by, so you have to be patient to get one."
Burnham Park,"Its not complete for a tourist/visitor not to see this restored park b4 he leaves the city. Walk to see and take selfie with the (dont pick) flowers, grounds, boats, trees and fountains around. The lake has few fishes and different boats designed for you to have fun rowing or just ride. Also Join free zumba or just run and walk around best every (early) dewy mornings (sometimes to catch up fogs) . Located at the center of the city and its accessible to all transportation areas some with mini buses that offers free sakay going to the mall, market, cathedral.... Accessible to food houses, recreational centers, grocery, coffffeeee shops, churches, night market, pasalubong stores, close to meetings, banks, schools and other universities, other govt entities and tge like. Youll find almost everything nearby malay mu pati jowa ma-nearby Burnham Park. So i suggest u walk. Rampa your beauty and the pogi looksüòÅ and its good for your health walking. Enjoy. See more and have fun staying in Baguio City."
Burnham Park,"Wallow in the cold breeze and peace here in Burnham Park Reservation.Just before leaving Baguio, my friends and I settled to hit this park for photo ops of course.We rambled the area despite the fact that in a few hours we'd leave for Manila.Noticing the kayaks afloat the lagoon, we agreed to ride one. Each has an oarsman (unlike our experience in Villa Escudero that we ought to learn how to row a canoe because no staff will go with you) yet some of us take turns in rowing our vessel. And we enjoyed it!I have forgotten if the ride is 30 minutes or more. What I vividly recall is our conversation the whole time. We amused ourselves talking about the presentiables and teasing our oarsman of it though he never really revealed who was he in favor of. The lad who rode with us is a college students according to him. In my guess, they are working to support their education. I don't know but the staff are of the same ages so I thought that they work there in order to study. They wore blue t-shirt for their uniform. Hey, you can look for them should you decide to ride a kayak and you could help send them to school.It's not a only a park where you can ruminate about life in general but it's also a park where activities can be done. Come and have a peek of it."

Burnham Park,"Went here mid March, on the week of Panagbenga Festival. The park was decently maintained, not a lot of litter as expected, and there were park guards at the Grandstand, especially during the event.We also went in the evening to try out their boat rides (we paid around PHP200 for 30mins, and you can rent out a boater as well if you can't row your own boat for Php50 additional fee). Definitely a decent place with benches if you want to relax and have a picnic for free. They also have bikes for rent if you want to roam around the park.Accessibility to the park maybe a little bit hard as they have designated gates for vehicle entry. If you're travelling via taxi, the drivers can only drop you off at certain gates."
Burnham Park,"Lots of things to enjoy in Burnham Park!First, you can go boating and you‚Äôll have plenty of choices. You can ride the basic boats (manual rowing) for 30min at 150-200php or add 50php if you‚Äôre not fit for rowing and someone will do it for you. üòÜ There are also boats that move by pedaling at 250php for 30min.Cycling is also fun. You can choose a bicycle, tricyle or a 4-wheel kart which cost 50-75php for 30 min. Just beware of the reckless drivers (mostly kids)!You can also have photoshoots from traditional photographers with the Igorot attire in this park. They take decent pictures and even guide you to pose for better experience. They charge 75php per 5R picture and will also send you soft copies via facebook.Fooodies! Even with the cold weather, you can never resist the strawberry and avocado ice cream. It‚Äôs at least 35php per cone (cheaper than what we bought in La Trinidad). There are also strawberry and ube taho, cotton candies, green mangoes, pomelo, guava and more which you can munch while walking or sitting.Lastly, you can just walk around and enjoy the view and weather in this park. There are lots of benches around the park to eat and rest. I even saw some families bringing food and having a dry picnic there."

Burnham Park,Went there for Nostalgia. Not the park I remember from when I was younger but it was still fun.Still relatively clean and the facilities seem to still be adequately maintained.Water quality on the artificial lake could be better though.

Burnham Park,"Hopefully, the LGU will make an effort to make the place as beautiful as before or more during holidays.Christmas lights, decorations, and the Christmas tree are being liked by people in the park, thus it may have been a good project for the city.Locals and tourists love to go here to spend time with families and hang out with friends especially during weekends and holidays, so attracting designs will entice them to go often to the place which will eventually help the local businesses in the area as well.At night time of holidays when there are many people in the park, if there are designs, it would be a great opportunity to attract more tourists to go to the city.Additionally, regarding the waste, large garbage bins or regular changing of trash bags will also help in the problem of 'full bins' as some address.The place has been one of my favorite places to go since I was a kid and I wanted it to be the same with the locals and tourists.Also, we observed that the fountains are not being played already and it kind of disappoint me and others.This coming holiday, I hope that the fountains will be on."
Burnham Park,"The most iconic park of Baguio offers all kinds of activities. In the morning, you can jog and exercise around the perimeter and after that you can join the zumba dancing. You can also have a boat riding on the burnham lake or enjoy the bike for rent along the road. If you‚Äôre tired, you can sit on the benches scattered around the park.

Burnham Park,"Everything here should have been perfect and I would have given this place a perfect score because of its vast green spaces and cool air, aside from the various sights. However, with regards to cleanliness, I cannot just overlook the plastic bottles, food wrappeds etc. Furthermore the rides are too expensive considering the pond water is so dirty and smelly. Furthermore, this place is not safe at night. One time, when we chanced upon this place at night, there are a lot of suspicious looking people tailing you and there are some offering sexual jobs. Plus, there are no police or security people at night."
Burnham Park,The park is full of recreational activity including the massage of some native people there. üòÜ For those are Abit tired after all the strolling around the city. this will definitely the last part you should visit to sit or do some rides on those cute bikes and release your inner child side.

Just be careful of pickpockets or those offering massages. Also sometimes the place can be very crowded

Burnham Park,"What I love about this place is the night market or bazaar. Every 9PM till midnight a main road around Burnham Park is always closed down to give way for this. If you're interested in flea markets this is a place to check. They sell jackets (winter, leather,denim), pants, shoes, ladies bags, head wears for an affordable price. Plus if you're into street food that got it they even have Korean street foods. Good way to load up on carbs before legging up the market. The local folks here are very friendly. The taxi cab drivers are very polite. No worries. Hotels in Baguio are very decent and air conditioning is optional most of them none very cold here. If you're visiting this part of the country this is a must visit. In the daytime Burnham Park have a lot of activity for the whole family to offer.

Burnham Park,"I've visited this park a couple of times. If you've been here before, you wouldn't want to go biking or boating again especially when the lake water looks filthy and when the biking area was divided by an ongoing road construction making it very crowded. On the good side, there are a lot of good restaurants around this park."
Burnham Park,"Place has lots of people and is back to its former glory! Wear your masks and don't entertain those that offer massages as social distancing should still be in effect, the authorities will fine both of you if you do."
Burnham Park,"The restroom is SO dirty. Like most of the restrooms I've been to during my Baguio trip, it was paid, so you would at least expect some level of maintenance but there was none.

Burnham Park,Went there during the end of Ramadan.It was a holiday but also off season so I think there were relatively less people than usual. there were areas in the park that were bustling with people but generally the place was quiet and a good place to walk around in the morning.saw several groups holding zumba/tai chi events for health (most participants were ladies/old people) while in other areas families/friends were having picnics and just hanging out. there's also a special area where you can rent bikes and play aside from the swan boats for rent in the pond.I recommend trying the Strawberry Taho vendors were selling for only Php. 30!
Burnham Park,"Burnham Park is obviously a tourist destination close to the city center. Tourists can enjoy biking, boating, and buying some plants in the orchidarium adjacent to the park. It is also convenient and accessible, so we advise tourists do some exercise or use public transport.Join the locals exercise and dance at the park from early to late morning here. You'll appreciate the park if it's less crowded.The lights can be enjoyed here when the nightlight bites. Lightings are installed all over the park. More festive lights are enjoyed here at Christmas, though."

Burnham Park,It was my first time there yesterday. I asked for a fresh donut. I didnt get one. The place wasnt busy or anything.  So sad. But i asked for ice and they complied. You have to buy 6 donuts for them to put it in a box. Donuts are large. 1 inch high and 4.5. In diameter. Good or sharing if you areused to krispy kremes. The taste reminded me of eating donuts in Baguio City's John Hay (when the americans were still there). For some donuts they have on offer buying two krispy kremes would be more efficient. Good to try at least once. Not all flavors available. Holiday creations were available when i visited
Burnham Park,"It's a big park in Baguio that i never missed to go to whenever we're around. A lot things going on in the place. The park is ideal for walking and jogging also for a weekend-picnic with the family. There's a man-made lake where anyone could test their paddling skills and go boating ( your option to go on your own or together with a boatman). Of course, that comes with a fee. A wide area to test your biking skills. Rent is minimal. Stalls selling souvenirs like handwoven bracelets, key chains, ref magnets, and the likes are everywhere so you'll have the chance to grab a present for your friends and loved ones. Must visit when in the city of pines!"
Burnham Park,Looks like Baguio is back to normal. Lots of kids enjoying the bike rides and open space
Burnham Park,"Perfect place for your kids, enjoy doing different activities like boating , biking and riding bump cars ."
Burnham Park,When you are boring living in crowded place. Why don't you try to relax and feel the nature. Im always in the Baguio because i fell in love to the place. Pine-tree and there's alot of flower and of course the weather. Its cold even you are just in the Philippines. One way bus trip pitx to baguio that's its just sleep in the bus when you wake up you are in the baguio üòäüòäüòä.
Burnham Park,"Ideal place to hang around with your love ones. Biking, boating, jogging are some the activities to choose from. I won‚Äôt get tired going back to this place to spend my afternoon."
Burnham Park,"So crowded now.  You will see the rose garden, but not that full of roses, unlike before. The one i noticed, the prices of renting bikes, are so cheap as well as in boating. P100/boat (4 pax max), if u would like to have a rower, you will pay him P50 for 30 minutes."
Burnham Park,Nice place.. you need to park your car in nearby  and dont go there in weekend
Burnham Park,"The most visited tourist spot in Baguio. This place gets very crowded at times, so it's best to go here very early if you're up for some photo ops. Even the biking area gets very congested, so be careful. You don't want to shorten your trip because of an injury.This place is very big so be wary of your companions especially kids. It is also good for joggers beacause of its vastness. Also, zumba classes on weekends at every corner(just follow the loud music).I just wish they would clean the water in the boating area, the smell denotes very diry water. I remember going here years ago when the pond has fishes and jumps on your boat.I also don't advice going/passing here at night or very early for safety reasons."
Burnham Park,"A place where you can roam around and meet other people or have a picnic. You can also rent a boat or bicycle in this park.

Burnham Park,"The heart of Baguio City, atleast fo me that is. You cant say you've been to Baguio if you havent visited Burnham Park. The best place to go where you don't know where to go.  I forgot the prices for the boat rides. There shop nearby if you wanna go eat or drink. There are a lot of people but it usually isnt a problem cause the place is big. You can always find a place to sit whether on a bench, a sidewalk, or even on the grass. Numerous couples make this place their meeting/dating spot. There are bike shops where you cant rent bikes but only on the designated track though. The place is also nice at night"
Burnham Park,Crowded on Sunday afternoon but if you went late at night there will be less people. Though expect there are a lot of Christmas carolers in the vicinity. In a span of 30 mins shelled out 4 times for 4 diff groups. Still quiet and relaxing place to stay

It was raining in the night so be sure to bring an umbrella when you go out.
Burnham Park,"You don't have  anywhere to park, it's best to find a suite, place, or hotel nearby so you can just walk from there.

Burnham Park,Place where you can relax with your family
Burnham Park,"We went there yesterday for the holiday. As expected, the park was crowded. Even the part where people go biking and do other fun rides looked like there was a traffic jam of go carts and bicycles. Even boats bump into each other in the boating area. It was understandable since it's vacation season. However, what irked me is the Pay CR. It asked 6 pesos for urinating ""with tissue"" lol, and they don't even have water to flush toilet with... They charge higher if you need to defecate but they'll only give you a bunch of tissue, still, no water. Just hoped there was proper maintenance since it's already paid... Other than this part, I think the visit was still enjoyable."
Burnham Park,"This December, they made sure to make it beautiful during the night. Love it"
Burnham Park,Great buys for cheap prices. Security can be improved. Police visibility is not that great. A roving one might be needed to avoid pickpockets.
Burnham Park,"We have so much fun during our visit here with my family. The kids will surely enjoy activities like go carting, biking, roller skating, boating and it has a mini amusement park inside. You can try their rides at an affordable price. Once tired, you can also enjoy the food as there are a lot of stalls you can choose from. If you're on a budget you can just enjoy the view and walk inside the park, watch people around, etc. It's right at the center of Baguio, near the mall, hotels and markets. Not so much to share on photos as I enjoyed the personal experience."
Burnham Park,"It's peaceful place for jogging in early morning, enjoy the beautiful scenery Of the lagoon boats & friendly local people & foreign & local tourists roaming the big Burnham place..."
Burnham Park,I was there at night time only and it was raining. Looking for parking space was a challenge and nothing much was changed. I don't see a compelling reason to visit unless you on a motorbike and enjoy riding the twisties.
Burnham Park,"Nice place to take pictures...Biking, boating and skating are available here"
Burnham Park,"Nice place located at the heart of Baguio City. You can find several activities while you are there. Try rowing a boat or riding a family wagon! There are many street food sellers, too. Don't forget, always keep your wallet and phone safe!"

Burnham Park,Great park!  Loved the lights at night.  Beware of people offering massages.  You will be prosecuted.
Burnham Park,One of the nicest in baguio to spend quality time with family
Burnham Park,"Nice place for family outing and good tourist spot but can be more organized in parking. And put up more signs insude the place. Playground is great for kids very safe.

Burnham Park,Its very family oriented park. You can enjoy rowing on the lake on board a swan boat.
Burnham Park,We went here before the pandemic and it was my 1st time..i just loved the place  
Burnham Park,"It still has some charming spots but overall, the park feels rundown and is perpetually overcrowded. The lake looks especially stressed. Maybe it‚Äôs time to close it for some time to give it some much needed rehabilitation."
Burnham Park,"I enjoyed biking!It was fun! I tried all sorts of bikes and there are plenty to choose from. If you ever get hungry from all the biking, there are dozens of food stalls you can choose from. The ice, the strawberry and ube taho are a must-try.This perfect for family occasions or if you want to spend some quality time with a loved one. Just remember, be prepared for the cold and rainy season. You might need some thick coat and some gloves and mask.Try different kinds of bikes to double the fun.One note to remeber though, the lagoon in the center needs some cleaning as there is quite a bit of unpleasant smell lingering around the area."
Burnham Park,So much fun when you are with your family and friends. It is indeed a park that needs to be preserved. Alot of activities surrounds the park.
Burnham Park,Renovations happening right now. Not the best time to visit specially after a night of rain... But... The Rose Garden and the flowers will give you a good morale boost.
Burnham Park,"An experience that was enjoyable, the Colors of Baguio and the Cordillera . I am so honored to be one of the Judges @ The Panagbenga Festival. The Final event after the Parade was held here @ The Burnham Park.A place to visit and experience , an attraction truly enjoyed thru the years."
Burnham Park,It is a beautiful park for everyone but it's in people's hand how to handle it as well as their moral to clean or leave garbage around
Burnham Park,I just love spending my freetime here. Watching families paddling the swan boat. No worries. Hakuna Matata.üòçP.S. try going at sunset. Take some photos. Very nice
Burnham Park,Nothing beats the classic. Its not Baguio city without this park. Surely is a melting-pot. Almost always crowded during the day especially on weekends and on peak seasons. If crowd is not your cup of tea dont visit this park on peak seasons; but if you want to experience Baguio to the core especially for first-timers in this cold and happy little city then Burnham is a must see. The pictures/shots i took are taken around midnight at the park which means no crowd (haha).
Burnham Park,"Well maintained gardens, cheerful atmosphere, lots to do, but quite popular and extremely difficult to find parking, sometimes even in their dirt lot."

Too bad he got sick during our rounds at this park but I really had fun and enjoyed our stay here at Burnham Park. Pine trees are everywhere, Happy faces and the Strawberry Ice cream is the best!!! I really love to ride the boat but there are too many tourist that rents the boat. If you want to know about our stay and places we visited at baguio, just visit the Youtube Channel of my Boyfriend: Burugista Vlog. Video of our stay in Baguio City is posted."
Burnham Park,"I gave it a 4 because I'm a Filipino. Cool weather, nice sceneries... but the lake color is not appealing."
Burnham Park,"One of the place I like in Baguio especially if you have kids with you, most of the attraction park is quite pricey. Difficult to find parking as well"
Burnham Park,A place where a family & friends could always value & remember. üß°
Burnham Park,Burnham Park Was Alright But They Need To Add more parking space. Because when we got there we had to wait 30 minutes Just to get Ourselves a parking spot
Burnham Park,"Try to atleast ride the boat for a unique experience and view of the area. Locals here are very nice and accommodating. Went here for day tour only. Got tired but still had fun, temperature not bad at all as expected for Baguio üòä"
Burnham Park,"The best park I've seen so far in the Philippines.Family  and friends  can go biking,  picnic,  boating  and rent traditional  costume and take photo over the lake and join  Zumba  session.We had so much fun !"
Burnham Park,Such a good place for fun and enjoyment
Burnham Park,"I visited Burnham when I was 5 or 6 years old. Back then it was clean, there was no much crowd. The Burnham lake has clear water, incomparable to what it is now. I remember somebody was giving food to the fish in there. Sometime in 2013, the gov't of Baguio changed the water of the lake, made some cleaning and clearing too, and hooray, the fish can be seen joyfully swimming. It was fun to row your boat in the lake before, but now, you'll just stand there wondering, whether the people really enjoy rowing and roaming around the sully lakeü§îbut besides it, there are still other things to enjoy at the park. The Children's park has now been opened to the public. I hope they're be guarded forward to ensure the equipment last long for everyone to enjoy. Picnics are also one of its strengths, the grassy areas serve as picnic areas for families to bond during weekends or holidays. The biking area too, lots of stories of my friends were them learning how to ride a bike, I tried one time I only got bruisesüòÖand I still don't know how to ride. I concede, maybe it's something I don't have to learn. Welcome to Burnham Park, enjoy, make sure to take only pictures and make memories. Take part in the cleanliness of the park by disposing your wastes properly."
Burnham Park,Good place to walk around and relax or sit beside the infamous man-made lake.
Burnham Park,I love taking walks here!
Burnham Park,"I suggest going there only on weekdays if you are a local. It tends to get over crowded on weekends and stay away from ""masahista s"" they get so pushy and annoying and they charge like theyve got golden hands. I hope the local government regulates these people"
Burnham Park,"The place is excellent for recreation, photoshoots, vacation or even just a simple stroll. there are also a lot of different things to try like renting a boat, a on- person cart, a bike and more. there are also a lot of food and souvenirs on every corner."
Burnham Park,Good place to take pictures with friends and love ones.. See the beauty of the flowers that blossoms
Burnham Park,"Great place to do your early morning exercise. There are Zumba sessions around burnham park.Tourists tend to flock this place even during early morning especially during weekend.Please clean as you go when you use the picnic tables.Sometimes, garbage bins around the park are not enough to contain the trash of the tourists especially during holidays and long weekend.Lots of comfort rooms around the park ."
Burnham Park,"Stealing a quick stroll during one of those ECQ days... No other people, just the plants, the man-made lake and us."
Burnham Park,"This is one of the busiest tourist destinations in Baguio City because you and your family can enjoy a lot of activities here. You can try your rowing skills at the Burnham lake by renting a boat of your liking. Or you can try your cycling prowess by pedaling to your heart's content aboard a bike of your liking - from two wheeled, to three wheeled, to four wheeled, up to five wheeled bikes. When exhaustion finally gets you, you can relax and eat and drink at the many restaurants and eateries around the park."
Burnham Park,Great experience!! Climate is cozy and cool. People are very friendly and they are willing to help us navigate the place. They were able to keep the park clean and beautiful. One thing that I will never forget is when we ride a boat and we dont know how to move. Thankfully the caretaker is willing to help us explore the lake.
Burnham Park,"A beautiful park with a lot of fun activities. Best place to with family, lovely boat rides.Safe & Clean"
Burnham Park,good to walk in early morning .there's also a nearby shop for coffee to awaken your sleeping good mood ..
Burnham Park,Our group visited this place last October 2018. The park is quite big with a lake offering rides for P30 a person. Other than the lake there's no other attraction. I observed that the park is not maintained for   cleanliness.
Burnham Park,"The Burnham Park is huge and we actually watch the sunrise at the park, its quite peaceful and the ambiance of the park by the pond was tranquil in the early morning before the sun was set, even at that time a lot of joggers are already at the park and you will see a lot of people doing some kind of exercise, there was also a boat ride and swan boat ride at the park, with a small fee. There was also a group exercise such as zumba that you could join, and picnic table for you to enjoy your breakfast. Its a good place to visit and to walk around, perfect for yoga and meditation. It could get really crowded depending on the day and time of your visit. There is a nearby eatery besides the park and I would recommend you not to eat there, we wanted to try some local food but we hot an overpriced mediocre food with questionable sanitation."
Burnham Park,"At the heart of Baguio City. Your Baguio City trip won't be complete unless you visit Burnham park. Well through the years Burnham park continues to improve. Not just a place to be for travelers, but even the locals enjoy havinv their time here. Its because you cab do a lot of things here, ...kids can play, ride a bike or a bike with a side car for groups, or a two-seater bike for couples... friends/couples/barkadas can do boating..people can have picnics, or even just sit down and take a breather.

Burnham Park,"Small park but full of fun. There‚Äôs a lot of activities to choose from biking, boating, play at their playground like a child or just sit down and relax. This is also a best place for picnic and have a quality time with family and friends. I also enjoyed their strawberry taho here."
Burnham Park,A lot of happy memories here in burnham especially when you're with someone special. My favorite hello and my hardest goodbye.
Burnham Park,"If you want a chill place to go to Baguio, I recommend this place. You can sit here after buying food from night market. I suggest the benches near the lake, the breeze is colder. Street vendors are also selling their food here like mangoes and strawberry taho"
Burnham Park,"Park appears to be designed around the lake in. The middle.  Ample areas of shade and sun available to stay cool or warm up.  Nice children's park with enough space for many children to play on swings, seesaws or run around.   Recommend taking public transportation (jeepney, tricycle) as parking is hard to find.  The city of Baguio is designed around Burnham Park. Recommended to visit here when in the city for a nice stroll.  In February (for the entire month, there are flower displays for a contest).  No admission required; to be enjoyed by the entire family.  Panabenga is the name of the month long flower fedtival.  The displays are right next to the market/outdoor shops for food and/or goods for souvenirs."
Burnham Park,"Well as a daily morning routine, Burnham Park always gives me a pleasant vibes"
Burnham Park,Burnham is a great place to lean on specially when you are alone and want to think
Burnham Park,"Many chill activities you can do on the park such as ride the boat, do cycling, sit down and enjoy the cold weather while eating warm shawarma paired with strawberry taho! Also like that they have many trash bins every corner so it wouldn't get messy"

Burnham Park,It was fun renting and riding bikes. There are a lot of people on the boats though since it was Christmas season.
Burnham Park,"Over the years, because of foot traffic, the place has become crowded. The park has now a mix of different recreational activities. A lot of ways to have fun but on the contrary, exclusivity and privacy cannot be expected."
Burnham Park,"Strawberry Taho anyone? This is the City Park of Baguio with a man-made lake in the middle. The vibe in here is just like the Luneta Park back in manila though the difference is its cold out here plus you can rent a boat so you and your loved one can enjoy rowing in the lake. This place is good for families and couples even friends. Here, I tasted the Strawberry and Blueberry Taho, some say its not much different from the regular one, but I say its way different because of the strawberry syrup they put in had strawberry bits too! REMINDER: Smoking or Vaping is not allowed in any part of Baguio trust me, I learned it the hard way. The fine is not a joke, straight up 1k, no 1st or 2nd or 3rd offence, once you've caught. Its done."
Burnham Park,The weather is very very fine üòç
Burnham Park,"What I like Burnham is the many activities that you can do... Boat-ride, jog, bike ride, have picnic, photo taken wearing traditional clothing and or just plain chill at one of the benches. Baguio is known for its cool weather where you can bask safely under the sun and the park is just perfect! Looking forward to be back!"

Burnham Park,"A nice place,  good for hiking and biking riding here in Burnham Park Baguio City Philippines"

Burnham Park,You get to see strangers and talk with them while you wait watch your neice and nephews play. And also the biking area was a bit crowded so we just went to the skating rink where there is less people because the rides there are a little bit expensive. Atleast they enjoyed the bump car and the trampoline
Burnham Park,Great place for an evening out with friends. It's so clean and tidy. Lots to do there. The pedal go-carts are fun. Does get busy at night!
Burnham Park,Nice place.   Nice lake with small boats u can hire.   Don't expect too much here.  it is a bit overrated.   Try not to go during peak season.   So over crowed and traffic is worse than Manila. Don't expect to park within a a mile.  hehe.During peak season this city and attractions are completely over whelmed with super traffic.  It becomes a grid lock. To enjoy this city avoid peak times especially around xmas and new year.
Burnham Park,You can see that this is the most popular area in Baguio since it's always jam packed nowadays. I hope people can try visiting other places in Baguio as well.
Burnham Park,"You can stay here in Burnham park your whole afternoon, You can do Biking, Boating you can do Picnic and a lot more."
Burnham Park,Promising like New York's mini Central Park if they just maintain the greenery in the park. Melvin Jones is where they setup the fireworks for Panagbenga festival. Too dusty though in this area and not much grass. Really needs serious maintenance.
Burnham Park,"Good place to walk, with rentable bicycles, too bad you cant ride with them inside the park."
Burnham Park,relaxing place.family can do different activities.hopefully can be maintained by LGU.best place to buy ube or strawberry taho

Burnham Park,"Burnham has improved a lot over the years. The city seems to manage littering garbage disposal in the area better unlike before where you see litter everywhere and garbage bins are overflowing. Also, at least when we were there lady week, the pee smell is now confined to the Melvin Jones area. Please Baguio, more efforts into eliminating the pee smell.There‚Äôs many things to do while at Burnham park a rent a boat, rent bikes for kids, stroll around the lake, there is also a children‚Äôs park nearby or sit on benches to enjoy the scenery."

Burnham Park,"Very nice place, I give 4 stars only because there's always a room for improvement."
Burnham Park,It's so nice and very fresh place
Mines View Observation Deck,"I went on a weekend and it was overcrowded!!! Barely any space to move! Overcrowded just to see the views. You can buy souvenirs and food there. I got the üåΩ and it was yummy. The bathroom was clean though when I went. The ticket fee isn't pricey at all, but no parking unless you go early."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great place to visit. Don't forget it to your itinerary. However, sometimes it's too crowded that it's hard to get decent photos of yours because there are a lot of people especially during weekends. Luckily I was able to get these photos. Love the scenery."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Come to Mines View Observation Deck to breathe and relax away from work!My friends and I went here very early to watch the sunrise. I managed to get few snaps of the place as it was jam packed with tourists from other parts of the Philippines. On a hindsight, it is always like this whenever I come to Baguio. This place never run out of tourists. And one do understand why... Had I happen to live near here, I'd also frequent this site.We no longer took pictures with the horses nor with igorot costumes on and whatever there are. We just wandered the Mines View Park to appreciate what's in there and buy food and clothing to bring home as souvenir to our love ones.We had our breakfast just outside the Park where a canteen offers inexpensive but satisfying food nonetheless while waiting for the Good Shepherd Convent to open because we'd buy their products like the famous ube jam.In the years to come and given the chance to come again to Baguio, I would still come to Mines View Park and do what I did.Visit the Park if you can! It's worth your time and energy."
Mines View Observation Deck,As usual. You‚Äôve got a nice view here if the weather permits you because sometimes the fog eats the view. Never the less it‚Äôs so relaxing and there are stalls where you can buy your pasalubongs as well. You just have to pay a small amount for you to enter the place but it‚Äôs worth it.
Mines View Observation Deck,"Gives a nice view of the mountains. Can get too crowded though, since tourists are not limited even in this time of the pandemic. Nice place to buy plants or get a quick bite too."
Mines View Observation Deck,"Mines View Observation Deck is indeed a breathtaking view. Despite the sun shining bright, it was only warm and not very hot.‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüëèThe parking area here is limited but the locals guide you to places where one can park. We parked right infront of a gated place to which they reassured us that it will be fine. It was not a paid parking but we provided tip.üòäThere are also a lot of places to buy pasalubong around here. You may check out as you walk to outside.üëèüëè............."
Mines View Observation Deck,There are many other good places you can visit on the ways most stunning views will see on road side if you are going by your own vehicle. This just a small place where from you can see one mountain that's all I didn't find anything interesting there. If you are going to botenical garden then Mines View is 3km from there
Mines View Observation Deck,"Great view of the mountain range. Unfortunately some are covered by houses, unlike before when Baguio was not that crowded. Lots of souvenirs to buy. They even sell a variety of plants in the area."
Mines View Observation Deck,Who would want to miss the Mines View Deck in Baguio City? I think most tourists visiting Baguio would not miss out this spot on their itinerary. You also get to taste the local delicacies & Filipino street foods here.
Mines View Observation Deck,The view was stunning. People liked lining up for picture taking dressed like the one on my image and they are enjoying how beautiful the nature is. The warm sun didn‚Äôt bother us because we feel the warmth as a relief from the city life we had.Baguio has a place in our heart and we will be back again.
Baguio City Market,Philippine bazaar market at its best. I mean when you want a merchandise you have 50 little merchants who want your business. This place is old but its character is pleasing. Every ones very nice. Haggling is encouraged.
Baguio City Market,"Place is clean and well-maintained.With good police visibility, which was good as you feel secured. Vendors are organized and helpful.This is place is nostalgic, nothing much had changed since I last went here years ago."
Baguio City Market,"Always visit the market for vegetables and pasalubong shopping. Bring your own tote bag. Ask around for the best price, you will always find the lowest price towards the middle of the market."
Baguio City Market,"Clean as ever... But you have to be wiser when buying... You have to canvas, haggle price and still check whatever you bought if it's complete, just that you don't have to go back there to pick up what's missing. üòÅüòÄ"
Baguio City Market,Mahal na  ang presyo.  Look  at  different  sellers  because  the  difference  in price   go  up  to as much as 100 pesos.  Fruits and veggies  fairly priced. The   sweets and  pasalubongs really differ per stall.Best  buy  are the  yarns! Comes in all colors  and variants  
Baguio City Market,"I visited Baguio Market on weekdays so I am not really sure if its crowded every weekend. Their pasalubongs are all cheap in price. Sweets, walis tambo, tshirts, seafoods and etc. You may choose this place for pasabulongs and souvenir if you dont want to visit the good shepherd since its a bit pricey."
Baguio City Market,"if you are to buy pasalubong, here is the place to be, the area is complete of all sorts of pasalubong, from baguio's famous walis, strawberry jam, ube jam, peanut brittle etc"
Baguio City Market,"Nice market, very organize and clean esp. on the fruit seller area."
Baguio City Market,"You should never miss the market when visiting Baguio City. Love the coffee, took me almost 1hr! Its clean. Follow the traffic signs, Loading/Unloading road side."
Baguio City Market,Lots of options to see and choose from. Great value for money. This is my favorite market in the country because it's so clean and orderly.
Baguio City Market,"Go to Stall #13 for your walis tambo needs, and Stall #149 for your pasalubong needs. They can give you discounts!As for your Vigan longganisa fix, you can buy it from.manong who sells it at nearby stalls that sell handwoven pasalubongs and flowers.Great place to buy your pasalubongs: Vigan logganisa from Manong. His stall is beside a small flower shop in an alley near the stalls that sell handicrafts and blankets. Get your walis tambo that lasts for years at Stall #13, and your coffee beans from Garcia's."
Baguio City Market,A good place to purchase pasalubong or just simply buying food for your daily needs when staying in Baguio City. The price is very affordable specially the vegetables.
Baguio City Market,"They say that public markets reflects the soul of every town or city and I seem to agree with it. Since my early childhood, I have been going around this place whether to buy fish and meat at the wet market and hire Marvel and DC comics at the souvenir section.The Baguio City market is not exactly the best place that one can go to buy things for the family. Its wet market section is really wet and never dry. Its vegetable section is no longer for veggies only. There is also a missing center park at the market where I used to shine shoes as a child but it is now occupied by stalls where mixed goods are sold. My government job at the Department of Trade and Industry requires me and my colleagues to check on their food items in conjunction with other agencies like the Department of Health and we do on-the-spot inspection.I rate this place 1 star only as it really needs sprucing up. Since the early 80s, the place was gutted with fire and I'm sharing my images here. I'm looking forward to the modernization of this public market."
Baguio City Market,A place to go if you intend to stay in Baguio for a week and save money on food and items.You will find most of what you expect on a Wet & Dry Marketplace. If you are not in the hurry best to check different stalls first for the best price on the same item. Be kind to the vendor it will make the price negotiation a lot smoother.If you are a tourist or foreigner best to hit this  place with a local friend to avoid being overpriced.Overall the Local Gov has done great in monitoring vendors who overprice and handle it. A must check place for souvenirs and treats.
Baguio City Market,"Clean, accessible and cheap prices for veggies, fruits and pasalubong"
Baguio City Market,"Feel neutral about this place. The people are nice and friendly. There may be some chances though that they will add more price to what the product should cost. So I would recommend you to buy from stalls that have their price tags displayed. If you're one of those who are great at bargaining, do it but keep in mind that they are all working hard to make ends meet. üëå"
Baguio City Market,"As a home cook who pretends to chef, a fresh meats, fish and veg market spanning between three and four city blocks is a good way to lose an entire afternoon. As usual with a large open market, the best deals take time and searching."
Baguio City Market,Great to do the shopping..love the place
Baguio City Market,"You'll buy a variety of needs and wants here from veggies to fruits to household items and even preloved clothes and many more! It's a bit cheaper compared to those being sold inside malls.However, don't expect this public market to have tiles and other luxury architecture as it is old and sometimes, when its rainy, you'll meet huge, furry rodents!"
Baguio City Market,Here in Baguio Public Market you can buy product using gcash.
Baguio Night Market,"Baguio Night Market is one of the best and unforgettable experiences. You have to be earlier before 9pm, that's the exciting part! cause you will see how they organize the apparel and a lot more.   You can buy a lot of branded jackets, sweatshirts and more at a cheaper price plus discounts if you know how to ask. After shopping there is a wide selection of food and drinks just a few steps beside the market. Never missed this experience if you visit Baguio City üòä"
Baguio Night Market,"They have a lot of stuff they are selling from thrift clothes down to phone cases and a lot more. As for the food, a lot to choice from like corn, barbecue,takoyaki and many more. There were a lot of people when i went there too. But it is fun to look around, buy some stuff and eat."
Baguio Night Market,"We had to wait until 9pm before the sale started proper. So amazing how all the sellers were so prepared 30 minutes to the start of the market time. The long line of people patiently waiting for both time and their turn. The security guards at the exit gate were so friendly even to remind us that we can't eat outside the market, offered us seat and entertained my friends and I with a lot of international topics. It was really great and fun being there again."
Baguio Night Market,"They started at exactly 9pm and was able to set up quickly. Although it was raining, the store continued. They put covers showing they were prepared. The local police were present but of course, you still have to take care of your belongings.PS. Photos taken using film cam"
Baguio Night Market,Baguio trip is not complete if you have not experienced the food trip and a little shopping at Baguio Night Market. Family and friends will surely enjoy the cold air outside while eating lots of food variety. Most of the ukay items here are cheaper and are good finds ‚ù§Ô∏è
Baguio Night Market,"Clean and orderly with health protocol reminders in place. Nice place to stroll around to see local market finds but it's disappointing how common souvenir goods' prices are seemingly overpriced (Good Shepherd ube jam was 20 pesos or more cheaper at Mines View Park than here). Convenient to buy though with its central location, but just be aware of potential tourist traps."
Baguio Night Market,"The market gets really crowded in the early hours of its opening but gets less people as it approaches 12 MN. Suggest you come late if you really intend to buy things, but the things sold in the night market can be bought naman outside of it during the day just explore other the shops at Baguio's public market. Only thing I enjoyed is the food bazaar."
Baguio Night Market,prices of commodities are almost the same as of those in thrift shops in provinces. the place is very crowded at night and since it is near the burnham park you could see lots of people strolling at night. tourists need to be careful of their personal belongings
Baguio Night Market,"This is an interesting sales venue/event. We got there at about 8:45. The sidewalks were packed and the vendors were ready with their goods on the side of the street. At 8:55, they all extended the poles on their portable shelters. At 9pm sharp, game on. Vendors rushed to erect their shelters and set up their wares with impressive efficiency. Within just a few minutes,  the shopping looked like a feeding frenzy on Shark Week. It is crazy how this can go from a busy street with heavy traffic to a busy shopping area with people elbow to elbow, all in just about 5 minutes."
Baguio Night Market,"Lots of choices to buy from clothes, jackets, souvenir items, shoes and more. Enforcement of one-way policy can be improved as well as police visibility so as to avoid snatchers."
Wright Park,"‚Ç±250/30minutes to ride a horse with a guide is not bad at all. The kids loved it. The guide was courteous, Kuya Rolly. The stroll around The Mansion and the mirror pool was my fave. The area had bike lanes and the paid restroom area had a landscaped zen like garden and was so clean. The whole area was clean and the lark was well kept. The pool had fishes on it. A few meters walk down towards botanical was a steak place you can wind down on, they have . Pine Country Steaks and Waffles! Highly recommended!"
Wright Park,Never fails to be mesmerizing. It's my 5th time to be here and I still enjoy going here. Nice to help local tourist spot and help boost their economy. Specially the ones that are striving to for it. If you love nature come here. But make sure it's the weekdays because weekends produce the most populous days to travel.
Wright Park,Part of Wright Park is under renovation. Love the view of many horses big and small. Also appreciate the efforts and presence of vendors around the park for more convenient tour. A thirty minute horseback riding is worth P300.
Wright Park,"When I was 8 yrs old we went to Baguio for a trip with my family. I wanted my child to have the same experiences and memories. Wright Park had more flowers more than 20 yrs ago. It was more beautiful. Now, even the trees are sparse and the water looks like its extremely murky. Nonetheless, I hope my boy holds these memories as precious as I hold my memories of Baguio when I was young."
Wright Park,"It is less crowded during the pandemic so we get to enjoy the park more.Great place to pass time, unwind and just to enjoy the beautiful scenery."
Wright Park,"This is where people visit for a horseback riding. As expected, there are many horses available but most of them seem unwell so we didn't tried to ride one. We just let the kid to experience it. They offer photo op with the horse and you just have to pay 50 pesos. The smell is quite not nice but understandable."
Wright Park,Nostalgic. Wright park is divided into 2. Upper and lower. The lower part is the horse backriding. The ride is 250/ 30minutes. I recommend camp john Hay if you want to horse backride because the space is limitedThe upper part is great. It is just across the Mansion. Make sure to take a photo at the long pond/reflection
Wright Park,"Ig worthy place. The fishes are cute, they all stop moving for a while. It's nice to take pictures here and also just a very refreshing place to explore. Bring a thicker mask or handkerchief because it stinks in the horse-riding area."
Wright Park,Kids enjoyed riding a horse around the city. P500/ head. Plus tip to your kuya tour guide. üòâ
Wright Park,My kids enjoyed their time on top of their horses. We were the only one's in the park and we loves it.
Baguio Botanical Garden,"One of the best gardens I visited. This place  is Eden-like cozy version. If you are dreaming of going to Denmark or Amsterdam or any European countries but on a very tight budget, this is a good alternative.The place is clean, the flowers are beautiful. The ambiance of the place is relaxing. There are food stalls too where you can just sit, eat, relax, stroll and repeat.This is also a good place to propose!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Marvel at the best landscape architectural project I have ever seen. Don't be fooled by it's name this isn't your typical plant based attraction.This place will be very hard to explain in words so it is best if you see it in personal. It has different cultural gardens. It has a great play with elevation. It has tunnels it has great paid comfort room that brings you deep inside the rain forest. But most importantly, it has a coffee shop situated perfectly to feast your eyes with a view."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"For entrance fee of just 10 pesos, you can spend time with your friends and family in this beautiful and newly renovated garden. Go on a weekday if you can to avoid the crowd. There is a milk tea stall in the middle of the park if you want refreshments, and a cafe near the entrance. Take time to see the cacti collection. Restrooms are clean. Highly recommended to both locals and tourists."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"This is a beautiful place to visit if your staying a few days in Baguio. I saw so many different varieties of flowers and plants, that I hadn‚Äôt ever seen before. There were a lot of people here so be patient you will get your turn to view. Also there is a very low admission fee. Your camera‚Äôs are going to enjoy this location."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"Newly improved botanical garden. With improved ambiance. When you want to shoot or pictorial you need a permit @ the entrance. Don not worry for your safety there are guards roaming around. Also restrooms are within the vicinity, you need to pay for maintenance aside from the entrance fee. Enjoy the view!"
Baguio Botanical Garden,"I visited Baguio Botanical Garden twice already. My first time was in June 24, 2022, then second time was on my birthday August 4, 2022. They have an entrance fee of 10.00 pesos only. It's worth it, beyond worth it. I enjoy visiting this place. It's like everytime you visit, you still discover something new in the place. You got to experience different ambiance as they have Japanese Garden, Korean Garden and lot more. You can see lots of plants, flowers and succulents which I love. You can discover new species of plants that you do not usually or rarely see in your own place. If you go to Baguio, I recommend this place for you to visit. If I go to Baguio for the third time, I will definitely visit the Baguio Botanical Garden again."
Baguio Botanical Garden,"It's good to be back here after a decade and I liked that they have developed this place. You only need to pay P10 entrance fee which is very cheap. The rest room is very clean and spacious. There are lots of beautiful spots for picture taking but expect to share the place with lots of tourists. All in all, it's a very relaxing place worth visiting when you're in Baguio."
Baguio Botanical Garden,great place with a beautiful scenery!! if you like to walk and just admire the surroudings then this is for you! The best thing would be that the entrance fee is only 10 pesos yer you get to see a great view! Tables are also available around so I guess you can bring food for snacks there but there is also a cart inside that sells coffee.
Baguio Botanical Garden,One of the newest open attraction in Baguio after two years of closed because of pandemic.They made a lot of changes in their landscaping. It looks more beautiful now than before.Just visit and see the new scenery.
Baguio Botanical Garden,There was a 10 pesos entrance fee per person. Super nice place to walk around specially if you are into plants. The park has different sections that have their own themes. Be prepared to walk and climb stairs though
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"The Baguio Cathedral is in the center of the city, just along session road. You have to climb up the famous stiff stairs but you have an option to go the other way. The Cathedral itself is huge and it's amazing as it's well maintained church though there's a lot of people going to mass. There's a Chapel that you can go to if you want a more secluded area and more peace."
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"The Baguio Cathedral is right at the center of the city. You can reach it via taxi, Grab or just follow google while driving.Parking spaces are available but you will be charged per hour. There is a ticket upon entering and they‚Äôll charge you at the exit.There is also a food court but it was closed during our visit. Restrooms have minimal charge but are clean.When we got there, we were lucky to have heard mass and see and touch the Black Nazarene visiting Baguio."
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,Well maintained church. You have to climb up the famous steep stairs or you have an option to take the other way which is easier option if you are not willing to put some leg work. Very peaceful ambiance.
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"This church is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Baguio. We went here on a weekday. Hence, there are no crowds, and we were able to pray in peace and silence. If you want to hear Mass, go early since it is always packed with crowds especially during Sundays. There is a pay parking area in the front courtyard. As in any church in the Philippines, services are held in Filipino and English."
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,One of the famous and historical landmarks in baguio. Located @ the heart of Baguio City. A very solemn and peaceful ambiance. A must visit specially for Roman Catholic.
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"We attended the mass around 5pm. After the said mass, we were greeted with an thick fog outside.  Happy to be back again Baguio"
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"Our Lady of Atonement Cathedral / Baguio CathedralOur Lady of Atonement Cathedral which is popularly known as Baguio Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral which was constructed in 1920 and got finished 1936.  It got its name from one of the titles given to Mary mother of Jesus. This church has a simple but elegant facade which (was) pink in color with rose style windows. It is located on top of Mount Mary Hill where visitors can access it using hundred steps stoneMy side story:I originally planned to come here after my appointment(Nov 4, 2021) at the Nationwide Health Systems Baguio Inc. but had to got to Triage first to secure a health certificate. God must have wanted me to go for adoration time before anything else bc there was surprisingly enormous surge of people at the place and each priority number takes a while to get accommodated on the counter. At that time they just called out for #26 and I got #56 on the line and was growing anxious waiting with the uncertain time I have left so i hopped in a cab and went to this beautiful city cathedral. The cathedral was like 5-10mins away from Triage so i figured I can spend a little more time there after saying my prayers. By the way, the cathedral is currently on renovation so I just managed to take a few photos inside and prayed at the Face of Jesus mini chapel located at the back of the cathedral. After 30mins, decided to go back to Triage and arrived just in time! My PN was called in within 5 mins! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èAs to my experience, Baguio Cathedral is a great place for spiritual reawakening! Try to visit and see why I said so üòâ I truly feel blessed for being able to visit and spend some prayer time here. My prayers were actually half answered by the time I stepped out of the clinic(my appointment in Baguio). Baguio Cathedral is a new addition to my favorite places ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚ù§Ô∏è"
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,No visit to Baguio should be complete without a visit to this church. Right in the heart of rhe city accessible from The famous Session road
Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,A perfect place to offer your prayers.

Our Lady of the Atonement Cathedral (Baguio Cathedral) - Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia,"Nice place & structure,But parking sucks.Overall i had a good visit from this place."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The strawberry farm was more organized now than the last time we visited. There is a huge parking space, restrooms are also available and garbage bins. The vendors are all on the side and their food maybe affordable but not very good quality. Hope they improve on this.The farm itself has been closed to the public and we were only able to close up to the gates. Despite it being closed to the public, I think this improved the farm by maximizing the space: putting lettuce below and strawberry on top (see last photo).It was fine for me that the public cannot pick strawberries for tourist purpose because it made a healthier growing environment for the strawberries. Hope people will support this so we can improve the quality of the PH Strawberry."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,This is one of the go-to places when visiting Baguio City. You can buy fresh strawberries here at an affordable price. The vendors are really nice and funny. They sell strawberry flavored ice cream and taho which is a must try! The place is very scenic as well.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"When we decided to go to this strawberry farm we wanted to make sure we will be allowed to pick our own strawberries, we checked with hotel staffs in holiday Inn, taxi drivers we rode in past 2days, vendors in local market nobody was sure if the strawberry season was still on (May 22). No phone number to call and check if we will be still allowed to pick our own strawberries. We arrived at the farm and it is a huge disappointed, Place is full of mud (make sure you are not wearing your favourite shoes), garages, discarded veggies everywhere. Walked half way in mud only to be told there is no starberries and have to go to the other enterance and try our luck there. Picking strawberries is expensive than buying from the store nearby. (Paint my fence and see how fun it is). Overall it feels more like a tourist trap. Good for Instagram influencers."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"Good for shopping, not much for sightseeing or experience. Entrance fee of 10 pesos into the farms, but nothing much to see inside, and with all the strawberries harvested, there's no strawberry picking. Even the lettuce planted in this place can't be picked. But you can buy the purple and green lettuce at 50 pesos per stalk.Large strawberry farm with different owners separated by fences. It's a proper farm with workers going to and fro with their vegetable. You can take pictures here, but most spots aren't picture worthy, just take a random view.The area sells lots of goods not limited to strawberry. Vegetables are quite cheap here compared to NCR, so if you have the space or a fridge to put your haul later on, it's the best way to spend in this spot.There's a wide collection of fruit wines from strawberry, blueberry, mangosteen, Bugnay, etc, at 200 to 250 pesos per bottle, very nice. There's also a strange snake wine with aphrodisiac components for the daring, as the seller said it can also strengthen the bone. Strawberry here are sold at 150-200 per pack of about 1/4 to 1/2 kg, a little cheaper compared to other spots in Baguio that sell strawberries at 250 pesos for less the weight.There are a few canteen style lunch options, the drinks are pricey, and there's no service water or soup to go with the meals,.be prepared to pay about 180 pesos to 500 pesos for canteen style meals.There are other odd wooden toys and items for sale in this place, and strawberry taho and strawberry ice cream (the ice shaved type) here, and lots of parking space. It's a hotspot for people into buying things. Shopping is the norm here, you'll enjoy if you brought cash. Selected vendors accept GCash too, just ask them."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,Went here to pick some strawberries but unfortunately it's not yet harvest season. Nice place to buy pasalubong and of course strawberries. There were a lot of stall to choose from. Be ready to bargain so you can get big discount.
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"I'm not really fond of strawberries but the ones I had in the farm and pasalubong center were good. The strawberry shakes were good, too. There were a lot of shops to buy from."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"The scenery is just that great and you can buy cheaper priced strawberry goods and vegetables.Avoid fixed taxi fare coz there are passing taxis here and you won't be stranded. The fare here is like less than 200 pesos from Genesis bus terminal if no heavy traffic, but if fixed you might get charged of 600 back and forth."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"This was quite a fun experience for us. The municipality of baguio is really strict when it comes to tourists coming from neighboring towns especially to ones who came from metro-manila NCR region. Nevertheless it was a compelling assurance that the people we get in touch with are uninfected or at least vaccinated. My group had so much fun with the different products the people has showcased. What gave us more excitement was the fact that we can actually pick our own strawberry fruits. It was not an everyday experience so for us, it was rare and really special. Hope to visit the place again. The people are also very kind which made it more friendly environment. The restaurant we ate with, gave us free vegetables to take home with us. We really appreciate our time here. Thank you so much la trinidad, strawberry farm!"
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"They have different varieties of pasalubong/take away treats to offer. From fresh fruits and vegetables, to the sweet and satisfying jams and other delicacy. They also sell souvenirs like Baguio printed shirts, keychains, broom, carved wood items, ref magnets and many more."
Strawberry Farm - Home of Giant Strawberry Cake,"So enjoyable, strawberrys are so delicious, fresh and so refreshing. I had taho strawberry and smoothie , Super sarap.There are great selections of vegetables, ornamental plants and herbs , just right for your culinary needs. Highly recommended"
Lion‚Äôs Head,"One of iconic tourist spots of Baguio that you shouldn't miss.During pandemic, it is recommended to strike a deal with your taxi driver to go to and fro here, coz the passing public vehicles are limited.It is not crowded during pandemic compared to before."
Lion‚Äôs Head,This is always a worthy stop-over. Everyone should pay homage to this post-modern structure for a bathroom break or a taste of that home-made strawberry ice-cream or to just take a snap of the big lion which i do all the time.
Lion‚Äôs Head,"It is quite far from the city. And as of August 2022 (during our visit) limited people are allowed in the area since the Kennon is no longer used as way going down to Manila.We were the only tourist during our visit, so you do not have to wait that long to take photos"
Lion‚Äôs Head,"The Lion'S Head:One of the most iconic tourist attraction in Baguio that you shouldn't miss! It's along Kennon Road and it's a landmark when entering Baguio City! It's free for all so have fun taking a selfie or groupies with the the beautiful sculpture made of limestone.üëâ PS: You may watch, like, comment and SUBSCRIBE to my YouTube channel üòò"" Arlene Aces """
Lion‚Äôs Head,This is a marker thst tells you that you are now entering baguio city. Enjoy take some pictures and have some fun. Just make sure to clean up your mess once you start again. Better yet just tale many pictures as you can. Make as many momories as you can. And leave nothing but foot print no trash.
Lion‚Äôs Head,Good experience. We're lucky that Kennon road already opened after the earthquake incident this July 2022. None much are affected in Baguio.
Lion‚Äôs Head,Perfect time to visit around 2pm weekdays not that much of people taking photos ‚Ä¶More

Lion‚Äôs Head,One of the iconic and most visited tourist spots in Baguio. One can say that you should visit this place when you go to Baguio.There were a lot of people when we visited. There were also taho and ice cream vendors.
BenCab Museum,"Very nice museum. I enjoyed seeing arts plus a good view of a hill and trees in one of the veranda of the museum. If you're already hungry, you can order a snack at their Cafe Isabel located at the ground floor of the building. ‚Ä¶More"
BenCab Museum,Really glad to have finally visited this place. I wouldn't wonder why sir Ben Cabrera is a National Artist. His works are magnificent and his taste on art is impeccable. Really glad the place has expanded so you get to enjoy and appreciate different types and media of art. Totally worth the time and effort. ‚Ä¶More
BenCab Museum,"We bought an entrance ticket for 150pesos each. If you are fond of paintings, you can enjoy this place. If you want to eat in the restaurant inside the museum, make sure to bring enough money because 1 meal cost around 200pesos. When I asked the cashier how much is the bottled water, she didn't answer me. That's why I gave 4 starsüòÖ By the way, the bottled water cost 60pesos eachüòÅ"
BenCab Museum,It looks so good inside the museum. Taking videos and pictures with flash is not allowed though.It's also hard to get a taxi/grab there so I recommend that you bring your own car.
BenCab Museum,Must see when in Baguio for those in the art scene. They also have good cafe restaurant. Allocate a full day to tour the place and enjoy the experience the artist has brought to his guests.
BenCab Museum,"Interesting collection. I did really like some of the paintings. The view outside is also beautiful. There is a cafe at the lowest floor, will definitely try it next time."
BenCab Museum,BenCab Museum is a great place especially for art lovers like me. It houses several galleries of different artists and exhibits and a nice place for venue shows. It also has a nice caf√© and beautiful farm and garden below the premises.‚Ä¢ Parking Space: Ample‚Ä¢ Staff: Super Friendly and Nice‚Ä¢ General Admission: ‚Ç±150They are open Tuesdays to Sundays at 9AM to 6PM.

BenCab Museum,"This museum is very informative and of course beautiful and meaningful paintings. It has a cafe and something like mini pond that has ducks and fish which you can feed (can be bought from cafe) them. There is also a souveneir shop. Overall, it has a nice view and very calmly ‚ù§Entrance Fee? Yes. Php150 per personCafe food price? Ranges from Php100 to Php300"
BenCab Museum,"If you are into art or just want to take artsy or hashtag cultured photos. You must visit Bencab!

You can take a seat on their caf√© and order a food. The food tastes so good!! Actually, no restaurant or cafe failed me in Baguio!"
BenCab Museum,"This place is awesome. The main highlight of my Baguio trip. It features tributes to the work and life of the National Artist Benedicto Cabrera as well as highlights the history of his art. Also displayed are relics from the natives of the area.You can spend hours immersed in it all and afterwards relax and recharge at the cafe and garden at the lower deck. A bit pricey but of course taking it all in with the view makes every bite worth it. Had pares, bulalo, and basil pasta. Will definitely come back the next time we visit Baguio."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This place is a aesthetically pleasing for people who have brave hearts. Well, I mean, you know the history. The air near the hotel is somewhat heavy for me and my other friends. But the place as I said is beautiful.I just hope their souls rest in peace and don't mind the visitorsüôÉüôÇü§û"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Last time I went here was October 2019, where you can still go inside the building and climb up to the roof top. As you go inside, you‚Äôll get that eerie feeling. There‚Äôs a fountain in the middle part where it feels so classic and vintage.Now, It‚Äôs 2022 and I went back with my partner. Tourists are no longer allowed to go inside due to the falling debris inside the building and for safety measures. You can still take pictures outside and within the premises. They now have an entrance fee of Php10.00 per head. They are only open up until 5pmFollow to catch up with me and my reviews! ‚úàÔ∏è"
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"The place was a bit crowded when we went in last March 20, 2022. Probably because it's the weekend and the restrictions were lifted. The place kinda gives you a creep but we find it amusing and amazing at the same time. The view is very calming as well and it's nice to take picture almost everywhere. Too bad we cannot go inside anymore not the same as 3 or 4 years ago. Overall we'd love to go back here when it's not that crowded anymore."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Simple and looks like it's ravaged by war kind of ambiance from the movies. Quick visit. Really old style preserved and only the fa√ßade is allowed for pics, can't get in due to renovation. There's entrance of 10 pesos for this outdoor pic. There's a garden nearby to unwind after if you like pine trees.This spot also has snack sellers, a place where you can take a break indeed.If you like old and dated, this is someplace to consider passing-by. Only, it's tough to get a solo pic at lunch time with lots of passers, so come early."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Wanna get spooked?Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden is the new name, Dominican Hill Retreat House as referred to before, to me it is Diplomat Hotel. Diplomat Hotel as it is called in the many TV shows that featured this edifice will scare you for the many elements that live in it.Did we get the vibe? Make a guess.We went here on a rainy afternoon. The rain beat us badly, we got wet. Thanks to the umbrellas that we have, it didn't soak us.Approaching the place made me think twice. I am skittish, jumpy, high-strung, even neurotic sometimes despite having so many horror books I have in my room or no matter how many hundreds of thriller-horror movies I already have watched and ghostly experiences I dealt with years back. So, I almost backed out but I did not. Thanks to my friends who laughed at me.We arrived a little past 5 pm. We paid for the entrance fee and waited patiently for our turn to have our picture taken in every part outside the hotel. Yes, outside the hotel. It is in renovation these days that we can only have a glimpse of this famous structure from the outside.Should I be thankful for that? Well, I guess not very because my heart secretly wanted to get in.Anyway, we meandered in the place for the remaining daylight there is and took photos of whatever we can. We went through a path in the garden and posed many many times for the camera for a souvenir that we braved the Diplomat Hotel. Hey, we loved the pictures by the garden. Braved if you can call it that way. Hey, we loved the pictures taken by the garden. It looked like from a fairy tale land.As for the spooks? Sorry, we didn't experience such. We're outside the building.We'll just go back sometime in the future to get this vibe."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"This is a beautiful area and worth seeing, however I do wish there was a way to restore the old church back to its original state. We spent a couple of hours here looking inside the church from the outside. This church sits quietly on top of a small mountain. There were venders there and I tried yam ice cream for the first time. This is worth a visit for sure."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,It‚Äôs been a decade before i went back here. More clean and many people becoming more interested in the place. But they don‚Äôt allow people enter the building maybe for safety purposes. I still amazed and grateful to be back    
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"Hunted mansion but still very unique. Paid entrance fee of Php10.00. At first glance of the mansion, it looked scary.  It‚Äôs abandoned mansion with some horrifying stories. It has garden at the back and with a nice view of the community and there is another garden with paved walked way adjacent to the front of the mansion is a garden."
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,Quiet place for prayer but they were cutting trees when we visited. First time buying their Angel Cookies. Sweet but I liked them.There's a small place for candle lighting.
Heritage Hill and Nature Park Garden,"We visited  this place, yet they restricted  you to enter the main hotel due after the earthquake  because  the building  is quite old , and for the safety for all..Entrace fee is 10 pesos for adult and 5 for kids.Operated  by the lgu so quite reasonableOld building full of history.üòÉ üëß my pay, my say  üòä"
Tam-awan Village,"Reconstruction of traditional huts and showcasing Baguio arts/history. Nice and short hike trail especially for young people to get them starting, or a couple looking for fun time out. Some stairs or walkways missing handrails though."
Tam-awan Village,Place is a bit dark as there were alot of trees. Highlight of the attraction would be the paintings made by i believe people living there. There was quite of it and if you love paintings and a little bit of trecking you will enjoy the place. You can also buy items there as there is a souvenir shop inside as well as home made kitchen food.
Tam-awan Village,"If you're into nature tripping, this is the place for you to explore. Though, one has to be ready to take the challenge in climbing lots of stairs. Entrance fee is discounted for students and seniors and paid upon registration. There's a hut selling souvenirs, another hut if you want to have a sketch of yourself, another hut where you can have a tattoo. Lots of things to explore and do. But for seniors, take note to visit when its summer cause the stones and steps are slippery and not senior friendly. There's also a gallery featuring paintings of local talents."
Tam-awan Village,Been here before and it was not exactly what I remembered. I remembered more art pieces back then. More sculptures and huts. Also don't bring a stroller here you won't be able to use it. It will just be an added weight. It's a hike going here so be ready.
Tam-awan Village,One of the best tourist spot in Baguio! The place is kinda far from the city but super worth it. Though it's not kid and senior friendly because the stairs are too steep. The place is still perfect if you want to learn about Ifugaos.
Tam-awan Village,"Amazing views at the very top view deck, you can even see the new Igorot Stone Kingdom nearby. Can be quite challenging to climb some high steps throughout for the children and elderly, and some steps were slippery, but it's the closest to nature you can be without doing actual hiking. The cool air is also a plus."
Tam-awan Village,"This village is a blend of Arts and Baguio's Nature. Located at Pinsao Proper Baguio City, art and nature loving indivoduals will surely enjoy this new tourist spot in the City. Nearby tourist spot are the Igurot Stone Kingdom and the famouse Baguio Strawberry Farm"
Tam-awan Village,"When I first visited this place 10 years ago, there were lots of artworks to see. It really showcase what it was like for the indigenous igorots to live during their time. That's why I decided to take my kid this time around. I was disappointed. Very few artworks. The hike turned slippery and dangerous because of the drizzle we were experiencing that day. So we didn't do the full hike. We had to turn back and leave. It was a waste of entrance fee because we didn't see much. Also, there were people in costume if you want to take pictures with them for an additional fee. We tried to get in one of the huts to explore but there are 2 men (the one in costume) that was sleeping inside. So we felt like we were intruding. But this is supposed to be huts on display. I feel like they shouldn't be in there sleeping."
Tam-awan Village,"It's a small village, like a cultural village. There's a short trek, I believe its around 20-25 mins trek. you can also have a picture taken with staffs wearing an igorot costume."
Tam-awan Village,"If the culture or living conditions of people from this area are unknown to you, this place is a must place to visit..it is rather small but it showcases thr houses, terrain..additionally for me very tasty food in the cafe, well worth the price you pay...."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Interesting to look at, challenging to finish looking at unless you're used to trekking. There's much walking and climbing on both left and right sides, and it's not suitable for seniors. The angle of inclination for its slope appears to be retained as is that's why it's tough.The left side from the entrance uses a lot of stones and looks rural while the right side has lesser stones and is like a western-inspired castle exterior. If you choose the left side first, you'd get tired, so better to choose the right side first. It's the side with proper stairs and the tunnel with stones painted like gold. The statues on this side look nice.The left side has a way of sparking your imagination. There are also references to Philippine folklore on this side especially on the gods.What's bothered me on the stone side was the lack of safety precautions in the area. The fence is barely there and is quite flimsy, the stair stone steps tiny, and if you slip, that's a super long way down!This left side has the Igorot costume fitting for a fee of 50 pesos for pictorial and several good photo spots for the view.They also have official photographers in the area who print the photo for a fee of 250 pesos when we came to ask.It's worth a visit, but do take your time, it can't be climbed and finished so quickly if you're easily tired. Rushing this place would spoil the experience."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,It was my first time here and I think it's a really nice place. It's great to see this amazing stone temple giving people some bits of history about the Igorot tribe. Good for picture taking but you must be brave enough to climb to the top to appreciate this beautiful picturesque.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"I personally admired the effort put into constructing this kingdom of stone. They deserve the visit. We really enjoyed taking photos of the stone structures that appear like stair-like terraces. It gives you a glimpse of history of the Igorot communities. With the actual houses and garden, this is a must see!"
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"The spot is still developing as it was made during pandemic. Some parts of it were not yet finished, workers are seen while visitors are in. The rate per person is 100 pesos. I think it‚Äôs a bit pricey but, it‚Äôs understandable as it is a privately owned tourist spot."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Entrance fee is Php100. Pretty crowded during the mid of the day. Great place to do a  hike.  A good place for photography because of it‚Äôs unique structure and architecture. After a 30-minute to an 1 -hour of walking, some variety of storesare available outside the kingdom for snack and drinks. A comfy pair of  shoes are advisable because there‚Äôs a lot of walking/hiking to see the other unique parts of the kingdom."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"View is beautiful. It is a stone throw tourist attraction from our relative's house so we went there as early as 7AM. Because the place gets packed by 8AM onwards, especially on holidays and weekends. Good for picture taking and learning bits about Igorot History. Entrance fee as of May 2022 is 100.00 per person. Parking space is a bit tight but there are few pay parking around. Transient houses are available near the area, too. Best to go as early as 6:30 AM so the place do not have much people yet."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Such an amazing sight to see! This place is built from stone, by hand I was told. I can‚Äôt imagine the time and hard work put into this location. This is a must see in Baguio if you have the opportunity. We stayed a couple of hours here and took some wonder pictures. Even as crowed as it was, people were polite and very patient. I would love to revisit here if I come back to Baguio."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"Open, but few areas still under construction. Good to visit in the morning sunrise. Good for pictures but the same stone background everywhere just different structures.Few shaded areas and amenities."
Igorot Stone Kingdom,A beautiful and a must visit place when you go to Baguio City. Kids and adults will surely love this place. Not advisable for senior citezens though especially to those who have difficulty walking  and climbing up and down the stairs. The place is not fully finished yet.
Igorot Stone Kingdom,"A very beautiful place. It gets too busy on weekends, rain or shine. I hope in they control the flow of people inside and remove the shops/stores from the highlight spots.Nevertheless, I will definitely come back."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,Great scenery. You just have to prepare yourself for a long queue in getting inside. Prepare your vaccination card and P125 entrance fee for adult. Discounts are given to kids and senior citizens. Wear shoes when planning to go here and umbrella for a surprise rain. Traffic is expected during peak hours/season
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"It was raining when we went here, you‚Äôll really feel like it was like winter. It is advisable to go here around 4pm so you can have a good spot for parking.ENTRANCE FEE10:00 AM - 4:59 PMAdult - 90Kids (4-12 years old) -30Senior Citizen (60 years old and above) -50Presentation of Senior Citizen ID is required5:00PM-10:00PMAdult - 125Kids (4-12 years old) -50Senior Citizen (60 years old and above) -90Presentation of Senior Citizen ID is required"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"The price is 250 pesos for adult and 150 pesos for kids. Not the best experience because you will have to stay in long lines as you can see in the picture. The organizers will make a lot profit for this because as I can count from the time that we were there, that number maybe around 500+.Visit this place during weekdays and never on weekends.Limited  parking space.Accommodating staff.Great lightings."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Pros: The place is beautiful, must visit in the evening to see the colorful lights.Cons: The place is too small, a little bit of disappointment because the entrance fee is too pricey for 90 pesos.Note: Bawal ang naka slipper so make sure to wear shoes and bring your vaccination card."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Place might be overrated due to social media, but a must experience. Lines can get long waiting up to 1hr during its peak hours, while you'll be spending less than 15 mins inside (P 125 entrance fee). Slippers are supposedly not allowed inside, but its'nt slippery so no worries. The place is quite small and can easily get cramped so wearing a mask is necessary. However there is something magical about this place that is truly worth the wait."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"It's relatively small. The December 2021 version showcased a short skit of the Nativity. You can take pictures with the cast. There's also a live band that livens the mood, and 'snow' every regular interval (not good for people wearing slippers and those who are careful with their shoes as it's just foam). Great way to bond with friends and snap pictures. But do not expect a grand scale area, again, it's small and limited."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"(Visited last Nov 15, 2022) We had a great experience at the Baguio Country Club Christmas Village 2022 with a theme: Oriental Winter Wonderland. The area is small, you can literally roam around in about 5-10 mins. You'll would probably stay longer for just enjoying the place, taking pictures, listening to the live band and christmas music, watching the Christmas nativity play (happens every hour if not mistaken), or buying food and drinks at the stalls around. It gets quite crowded fast too, thus the 4 stars. Line Queue buildup starts at around 5:30pm, as Evening is the best time for you to visit this place. Finding a parking space is rough and traffic gets really busy at peak hours. It would be best and more convenient if you just get there via Taxi.See photos and captions."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"Very crowded inside and the ""snow"" will surely make your shoes muddy. That's why it's good to follow the rules, wear shoes instead of slippers. Nice attractions though, good for picture taking"
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"This place was known as Christmas village. Yet, when the Panagbenga started, they develop this area and design it into a Japanese culture. When you visit here, you will be amazed of the beautiful scenery. You will really feels you are not in Baguio. Just come in visit this place. The landscape won't last long. It will end when the Panagbenga ended also."
Baguio Country Club Christmas Village,"We enjoyed a lot and It's worth the fee. But as far as I know, there is crowd control and a limit on the number of people who must be inside the Christmas village, but when we were there, it seemed like there were so many people inside that you couldn't enjoy the attractions or take a nice photo because of the crowd. Maybe this part needs to be improved. But all and all, the place is beautiful. If you have kids, I recommend that you bring them along - they will really enjoy it. Pinaka nag enjoy kami sa mga poging Korean Kawal üòÇ"
Bell Church,"I wasn‚Äôt sure that I really wanted to visit this location. But it is worth the visit. This is a beautiful Temple that still offers a place to come and pray. I can‚Äôt begin to imagine the number of people that visited here to pray. The grounds are amazing, quiet and very well preserved. There is a view point that allows you to see the surrounding area, if your willing to do stairs. They invite you to bring your camera‚Äôs, but not inside the Temple."
Bell Church,"A known tourist spot here in Baguio City. If you are a peace and nature loving person, then go to this place. A picturesque mountain side which they turned into a temple. This is along the highway going to La Trinidad Benguet. Nearby tourist spot is the Volley of Colors which is just 3 minutes walk."
Bell Church,"Before you reach the Taoist Temple agte, you'll pass thru the street with shops, you will notice that the Taoist walls were not taken care of. On the temple itself, it's fully renovated, newly painted, and newly trimmed landscape. The view from the lower ground is perfect to take photos of the gazebos with statues. Elders would have difficulty climbing up the ladder since it's stiff. They may just stay at the temple."
Bell Church,"Bell Church is a Buddhist Temple. This place is one of the tourist destination of La Trinidad. Open minded people like me will enjoy here. Aside from the beautiful scenery which will welcome you upon entering this place, you will be amazed of the persons personality inside the church of you are not shy to talk to him. You will gain more knowledge about their religion if you are willing to learn. The key is to ask, then you will find the answer."
Bell Church,"Be respectful, this is still a church. It may not be your religion but it is someone's religion and they hold the place with much reverence the way you would for your own church. So I really dislike that there were tourist that were running around or shouting. We were there late in the afternoon and it was a cloudy day. So there are only few tourists but still, some were loud."
Bell Church,"Close to boundary arc of Baguio and La Trinidad, from Baguio this will be the last right corner with a police station. Place is well maintained, there will be alot of stair climbing for this place as well. On the peak of tourist accessible only location is a sight to behold. As far as Ive observed it seems to be a Chinese temple as there were alot of traces of Chinese characters and items relates to it."
Bell Church,The place is well maintained and they also have a lion dance for visitors to watch. Love also the colors of the temple.
Bell Church,It's a really cool place to spend your time. Just got to be ready with the steep stairs and a lot of climbing.It has a parking for a few cars.
Bell Church,"A hidden gem of Baguio city, Bell Church is a Taoist temple that is known to be one of the most peaceful places in the city. A striking pagoda and beautifully landscaped gardens soothe the soul even before you enter the temple. Bells, dragons and flags welcome you to this Chinese temple that is calmly spiritual and incredibly tranquil. There is even a lotus pond that adds to the beauty of this serene temple."
Bell Church,"Bell Church is a Chinese temple of the Chinese Filipino  located in the Baguio-La Trinidad boundaryNo photo opt inside the temple (church), observe silenceBut photo opt in the whole place is of course mayYou may climb up to the highest tower to have an overlook view not just of the church but the neighborhood and houses on the clip of the mountainMinimal fee per pax and car park: p20Souvenirs are available before the main entrance of the place"
Good Shepherd Convent,"they open 8:15am until 4pm but it's better to be there earlier, because the gate hasn't opened yet but the queue is long. Also, not all products are available, every day there are different products available gaya ng cookies pero ung ube laging available!"
Good Shepherd Convent,"What‚Äôs the hype about it?  Ube jam made by the convent sisters ( and strawberry jam but sold out at this time) Decided to check out the convent but (apparently) the only thing to do here is buy from their store (which you can also buy outside for additional 100 pesos).  Tip:  buy from the resellers if you see a long queue as they‚Äôre legit Ube and the convent sisters approved their reselling, you get to help the sisters and the small merchants at the same time."
Good Shepherd Convent,"We all know that their products are so good, resellers/scalpers flock the area as early as possible to be able to queue many times. Most products are out of stock as early as 9am, we were just able to buy two 12oz of Ube, ‚Ç±350 each. Resellers sell this for ‚Ç±400 to ‚Ç±500 pesos in the market. They even sell just in the entrance of Good Shepherd, they‚Äôre making a business out of someones business. It is annoying but we can‚Äôt do anything about it. We just don‚Äôt buy from these resellers."
Good Shepherd Convent,"This is where you can get quality ube jam. The only downside is the long lines. If you're in a rush to buy ube jam, you can go to one of the nearby stalls, albeit the price will be a bit higher."
Good Shepherd Convent,"There's a long line for buyers when we went here on Monday, took us roughly 30mins to an hour. They have chairs set to line but there are portions exposed to the sun, hopefully they can organize it better.They only use paper bags since they don't support the use of plastics, they offer P45 ecobag or cartons for big orders only, so better if you bring your own ecobag. Ube jam bottles are not wrapped on papers, its less secured.Product taste and quality-wise, exceptional as ever."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Manage your expectations. In order for the manufacturers to maintain the quality of their products, they have only limited stocks for sale everyday. Hence, buyers should flock the store early in the morning to avoid shortage. When we went there, the strawberry jam was unavailable. Max of 2 bottles of ube jam are allowed per person. Others may be purchased more than 2 perhaps. They also offer other products."
Good Shepherd Convent,"Although there is a long qeue of lines, its stil best to buy your pasalubong, knowing its new or still fresh stocks compared to the market"
Good Shepherd Convent,"Long line, then limited piece per order for snowballs. Imagine a tourist from manila mostly booked in a hotel. Going from the hotel paying almost 200 pesos for the taxi fare finding out that they can buy only 1 pieces of sbowballs? What? You think we dont have families and friends to give pasalubong? Someday It will be your loss."
Good Shepherd Convent,Long line so go here early. They also have a limit on the quantity of items you will buy to discourage reselling.They also have a bdo pos terminal so they can accept debit and credit cards.
Good Shepherd Convent,Good products but it's too haggard to fall in line. Their service is slow.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We started the trekking from butterfly farm and ended up exit via the horse stable which we think it‚Äôs not the exit. Lack of signboard is the issue.Overall the trekking was enjoyable with cool breeze. There should have been some shelters at checkpoint in case it rains. It rains when we were half way trekking, though we have umbrellas but it‚Äôs very chilling."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"My experience? Just had fun taking photos... I didn't knew there's dress code, I was in heels so I wasn't allowed to take any of the rides. The place is so nature, you could smell the pine trees' refreshing aroma. I definitely want to go back and try at least one of the rides! Recommend much!"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We had a nice experience at Tree top. Their staffs are very friendly and helpful. The rides are safe enough, we tried the Canopy ride and the Surfer slide which costs 400 pax for the both rides."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Had a lot of adventure activities to offer. But if your not that adventurous, the 300-meter trek is worth it especially at the end of the walk where the amazing view of Itogon mountains awaits.Must visit destination at Camp John Hay."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,Wow what an expirence it was to visit this tree top adventure we had a blast here. There was cable cars/seats to travel along to an observation point a nice gentle ride. With very friendly staff and plenty of saftey equipment. Fast ziplines and trekking. Once you have been here an had an amzing time I recomend heading to the butterfly sanctury for a beautiful hike around the mountains so many breath taking views.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We did 'Trekking and Skywalk' and enjoyed the experience. The required hike was short and easy, and the view from the skywalk was breathtaking. The whole activity lasted us an hour.There is a briefing upon entering the place to inform visitors of the activities on offer and what those activities involve."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,It was the venue for my nephew's wedding and the first time I've been to this part of Baguio City.I'm one of the Filipino people who could be proud of this particular place for any party or get-together or any activity you name it. It's an adorable place which I've witnessed seeing it from top and looking down below I was amazed.I even dreamed of having the place for my party in future in God's will. Just take note of having a good caterer company to cater all your needs and up to your standard then everything will be perfect.
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"Highly recommended for families and friends bonding who loves adventurous and thrilling rides through ziplines with very beautiful view of tall and giant pine trees in Baguio.  Very good and well maintained facilities, and very courteous staff."
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"This place is the best destination for all baguio visitors who are looking for adventure, thrill, excitement and fun.It has many rides supervised by professional and kind staffIt suites adults and kidsAlso it is located in Camp John Hay which is considered as the most popular picnic destination in baguio"
Tree Top Adventure Baguio,"We came here as early as 9am and we've experienced riding the Canopy, Silver Surfer and Superman in priority! Haha We enjoyed the rides, especially the views! It's a nature trip with a twist! üòâüëå Plus, the Packages prices are so much affordable. Best to enjoy in groups (family or friends)."
Valley of Colors,"A new tourist spot in Baguio. An instagramable place just along the high way going to La Trinidad. This spot will not take you about 5 minutes to complete your photoshoot. So when you are visiting this spot, you also try to visit nearby destination like the Bell Church which is just 3 minutes walk away."
Valley of Colors,The concept is actually great. What is remarkable is that this number of private houses agreed to be painted absent their choices of color in order to bring the best of this hill. This may symbolize that unity can achieve greatness. I did not realized such before because maybe this place is very familiar to me as I almost daily passing it by. The place is easily accessible thru La Trinidad Jeepneys. There is no specific parking place but you can park side of the highway.Hope they will repaint it again to bring back how it was once vibrant. The animated photo is not mine (CTTO).
Valley of Colors,"Honestly not worth it. The place has not been maintained. Crowded and there's really no room when several batches of tourist come at once since it's literally along the highway. However, I won't stop you if you really want to experience it. Camera filters are the key. üòâ ‚Ä¶More"
Valley of Colors,"Good photo shots from afar, not nice up close. Crowded residential area painted creatively. If it weren't for the paint, it would be close to a city slum area on a hill. I think it needs improvement to be a safer & scenic tourist spot. The colorful houses have a 10 pesos donation at the space near the entrance that also sells goodies. You can take photos only up to the bridge. Don't go further in because it's a private residential area beyond the bridge.The view still does have a little charm of watching a movie's scene where poor people live. You can see some laundry hanging outside. The ambiance isn't relaxing. There's water under the bridge. The bridge can be shaky, so don't shake it while walking through it. And since it's a private residential area, there's quite a number of passerby and traffic along the bridge since it's not separated.If you just want photos, it's a quick stop. If they improve the traffic by making another bridge path for tourists, then maybe it'll be better. It's hard to take solo pictures while people pass through the bridge after all."
Valley of Colors,Colorful cute houses! The area is still closed but you can still go to the bridge area to take photos. We had this photo taken on our way to Banaue Rice Terraces.
Valley of Colors,Use as a setting for Erich Gonzales famous teleserye The Blood Sisters. Love the vibrancy of the valley!‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Viewüì∏üì∏üì∏üì∏üì∏ - Instagrammableüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä - Enjoyable
Valley of Colors,"If you would like to experience the cold breeze of the City of the Pines - Baguio City, don't miss to take time to travel and witness the colorful houses of La Trinidad, Benguet (Boundary of Baguio City and La Trinidad.It is just 20-30 minute jeepney ride.You should not miss this one! üòÅ"
Valley of Colors,Great art work! A must visit. More fun in the Philippines!
Valley of Colors,"You have to wait for your moment to get a perfect picture. Few mins walk to bell church. I just hope that the residents show their appreciation for having their place as an attraction- by removing their clothes hanging in their window, just sayin‚Äôü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Valley of Colors,"It's nice, but if you don't stand directly on the foot bridge you capture everything else."
Teacher's Camp,"I love the room so homey and simple but  clean. Beddings super clean also . There is hot and cold  shower. Near of everything resto and restobar convenient store, accessible tp public transpo. Most of all i love the view. We had coffee on the bench while bracing the morning dew and the beautiful sunrise. Difinitely we will go back again."
Teacher's Camp,It has been a nice place to stay when in Baguio. It‚Äôs cheap rates and discounts for government employees are great. Staffs are kind too
Teacher's Camp,"Beautiful place. Conducive learning environment. The weather is cold, a lot of corner and instagrammable spots."
Teacher's Camp,"Stayed here during our 9th PTYC. I enjoyed the view of towering pine trees and relaxing environment, it was a memorable experience."
Teacher's Camp,"I just love the place. Cheap but nice place to stay, esp when youre having vacation  with your family. We stayed in  1 of the guest houses furnished with with sala set, dinning set, refrigerator, kitchen where you can cook if you wish too."
Teacher's Camp,Really had a nice stay here in Baguio for the CMLI Annual Convention. The building we were staying in was newly renovated and secured with CCTV cameras. The rooms were also clean and very spacious. Their bathrooms are one of the most comfortable and clean bathrooms I've seen. This Camp is very big and you can stroll around the place. Very beautiful view and cheap souvenir items.
Teacher's Camp,Super Enjoy!!!! from Bestlink college of the Philippines
Teacher's Camp,"I went here to visit their gardens. Beautiful rows of flowers. Very picturesque. I congratulated the lady gardener and said thank you for what she grows. She gave me a big smile, I know she's proud of her work"
Teacher's Camp,Refreshing air and nature it's good and cold üòÇüòÇ we stay for 2 night and it's very freezing ...
Teacher's Camp,"The place to stay in Baguio for travellers on a budget. They offer rooms mostly with common toilets and baths with hot water. They charge per person and provide toiletries. Friendly caretakers and guards. Facilities need upgrades and improvements, esp. the conference halls and rooms. Many pine trees and cool air but expect air pollution as many vehicles pass through the main road. Discounts for government workers."
Teacher's Camp,"A must go place if you are going to spend time at Baguio. The environment is well-maintained. However, the cottages could be a little more better if they will make some maintenance work especially on the comfort room but it's still manageable and their rent is more affordable. There are also strawberry taho vendors roaming around the area in the morning which is very nice to eat some taho while enjoying the nice view of the pine trees."
Teacher's Camp,"If you're looking for a budget room and are not particular in room amenities, this is the place for you. Rooms are presentable at best, they have working heaters though cr is shared (like in dormintories). Awesome view and accomodating staff."
Teacher's Camp,Been here for the second time and don't feel anything strange though. There were a lot of students when we came so it could be one factor why it isn't suspenseful as there were a lot of people around. But checkout my second photo below üëáüëáüëá. Not sure how to explain the photo I caught in the window on the second floor. All of these photos are real. It's up to you now how you will absorb it.
Teacher's Camp,"A nice place to recharge and unwind. A good place for families and friends. As of this month, November 2019, they increased rates for cottages but still affordable. They also have toiletries now üòäüèÜ"
Teacher's Camp,The venue has been improved but the food does not match needs of the attendees.
Teacher's Camp,Beautiful landscape of pine trees. Great for teachers who want to stay in the camp because they have a discount rate. Wonderful place to stay in their cottages with your family.
Teacher's Camp,Very good staff and amenities. God for budget friendly folks of Baguio. Lots of parking din.
Teacher's Camp,Another place to visit when in Baguio city.Quite famous for being one of the most haunted places in the Philippines
Teacher's Camp,"Good place to take a walk,i just hope the oval would be available soonü§ô"
Teacher's Camp,Nostalgic. Love the place. The drainage smells really bad.
Teacher's Camp,Most buildings have been renovated and are in good condition unlike before. Never miss their souvenir shop since they sell goods for a cheaper price. Most things in Baguio are very affordable.
Teacher's Camp,"The units we have used in the past have greatly improved since our last visit in 2018. However, may I suggest that regular repairs and maintenance be programed so that minor defects are corrected early enough and  thus save money. Moreover, if budget allows, screen windows are highly recommended to minimize mosquito bites on guests esp on the children. Praying the above suggestions are viewed as coming from a concerned taxpayer. Thank you."
Teacher's Camp,"so relaxing and the employees, caretakers, guards are very accommodating"
Teacher's Camp,I personally like the place. Too bad we can't wait till 2pm to be able to check in since we arrived at 4am. The staff there didn't shove us away and was kind enough let us stay for quick naps.
Teacher's Camp,"The place is perfect and suitable for training, conferences and the like. It's very accessible. Love the structures there especially the admin building."
Teacher's Camp,Affordable and relaxing place to stay in Baguio.We chose the dormitory type room.
Teacher's Camp,The cost is cheap. It's a nice place for seminars especially for big crowd. Can handle 800+ delegates
Teacher's Camp,"Guest room 4 c,d and e are good locations.Very accessible to the main road and just a walking distance to some of the food stores around the area."
Teacher's Camp,Where here to attend the seminar :)
Teacher's Camp,This is a good place for large gatherings. Rooms are inexpensive compared to others.
Teacher's Camp,Very nice place to stay. I love the ambiance.
Teacher's Camp,Nice place to be with nature and spend your vacation... Verry accomodating...
Teacher's Camp,"We rented a whole house, fully furnished where you can cook your food, with hot shower."
Teacher's Camp,"Nice place with very hospitable staffs. Mukhang creepy pero wala naman talagang mumu. In fact, i slept alone at our room when all my roommates went out to chill. Pang instagram yung place & i love it!"
Teacher's Camp,"Serene, fresh air, feels like you're in  farm that is mountainous"
Teacher's Camp,"Home away from home! I love our guesthouse, it has everything we need for meals and coffee!"
Teacher's Camp,Place is quite old but still works very well. Parking is also not a problem which is very good. Provides very good accommodation to guests!
Teacher's Camp,Not crowded. Lots of open space.
Teacher's Camp,Some staff are not approachable when i went to make reservations but others are nice though..i do understand that maybe she was tired when I went to talked with her. the facilities looks nice.. the buildings are newly renovated that makes it so vibrant and beautiful. The cottages are nice too.
Teacher's Camp,Very very affordable place. Nice and cozy. Kakatakot lang ng konti. Hahah
Teacher's Camp,"If you are equipped for outdoorsy- adventure-stay then this is the place...cabin type houses and dorms. Although be prepared there are no indoor heating. There's hot and cold shower. If you chose to stay in dorms there are no electrical outlets inside rooms, all located outside halls. Decent bedding and linens. Cabin/guest houses are more suited for families."
Teacher's Camp,Nice place lots of flowers
Teacher's Camp,Do you like history? Do you like nature? Or do like paranormal? You can have it all at Teachers Camp! Teachers Camp mainly offers its vibrant surrounding and very accommodating halls and cottages for those who would like to held their seminars or just want to stay there. It is also very accessible for tourists since it is just minutes away from the central business district.
Teacher's Camp,"Good place. Yet, needs maintenance to be more presentable, convenient & competitive..."
Teacher's Camp,They offer low cost accommodation. Not too many amenities so do not expect a hotel treatment. But if you are looking for affordable accommodation surrounded by pine trees this is the place to be. Some say that some cottages are haunted
Teacher's Camp,"The cottages need renovation and should be maintained properly. Cats & dogs roam around the vicinity and if you fail to close the windows with broken screen, the cats will enter your cottage and share with your meals. Water heater in the cottage where we stayed is not working. It could have been a nice place to stay only if well maintained."
Teacher's Camp,"Wide awesome place to just spend your day and enjoy a nice jog or walk. This place is mostly used for workshops and seminars. The thing is, the stuffs sold here are a bit expensive so you might want to buy outside, maybe buy if it's only a must."
Teacher's Camp,"Very affordable with a very baguio ambiance. If you're the type who runs but can't go out running since you're not familiar with the city, there's a track and field area within the premises. Some of the popular night spots and restaurants are also located just across the street. Unfortunately, it is also a very popular place for seminars so they're almost always full. So better make a booking early."
Teacher's Camp,Want to breathe fresh air and want to jog in a quiet place? Here's Teacher's Camp. üòä
Teacher's Camp,"The management should improve their service. You have to go to your room far from the admin bldg without any guides. No signages. When you check out, you have to walk again to the admin bldg. carrying your heavy bags.The place is nice,relaxing and full of nature,but the admin and staffs should have more hospitality training.Except our caretaker,the only staff who greets the guests."
Teacher's Camp,Guest house 3 reminds me of our old house. I hope it gets updated though.
Teacher's Camp,Nice and very clean.. Marami security guards
Teacher's Camp,"my first morning here is so great!.., the first i tasted their strawberry taho"
Teacher's Camp,Nice place. Love it!
Teacher's Camp,"A nice, simple place in Baguio"
Teacher's Camp,Very accommodating and welcoming. The food was amazing and the place was cozy. It also was very accessible and many shops inside where you can buy most of the Baguio souvenirs and delicacies.
Teacher's Camp,Reminds me of my childhood adventures at Baguio.
Teacher's Camp,"The place is peaceful and suitable for group activities like seminars, teambuilding conventions and similar undertakings. It is clean and has perfect environment conducive for relaxation  ."
Teacher's Camp,I went for triage due to Covid-19 here. The people were very friendly and understanding of what I went through. They assisted me as best as they could on my process to enter Baguio City.
Teacher's Camp,Very peaceful place. Its a great area to do some jogging or other outdoor activities. But no restaurants though. So youre gonna have to bring your own food.
Teacher's Camp,Fun!! may be because of the enjoyable activities and team building that we do there prepared by our leaders during YSA conference. They say that the next conference will held there again. It's a nice place. üå≤üå≤üå≤üå≤üå≤üå≤üå≤üå≤üå≤üçìüçìüçìüçìüçìüçìüçì
Teacher's Camp,One of the classic sites in the city that still has a lot of pine trees around. Old but functional structures that reflect the look of the old Baguio City are still around. Hope DepEd will find ways to preserve this historical place.
Teacher's Camp,"I love the places and we really enjoy our stay here from June 21 to 24, 2021"
Teacher's Camp,"Although renovations are on going, i wish the management would put more effort in maintaining the area. It's one of the iconic places in Baguio and it deserves more care and attention."
Teacher's Camp,"They said..pag gusto mo mag ghost haunting,the best place to go is yung white house sa baguio.well,i say..hindi lang dun may multo.teachers camp is one of the oldest camp na pwede ka rin makapag ghost haunting.we had this one experience nung 90's when our group went to baguio and stay in one of the cottages or bunk houses of the the camp.and super creepy talaga when we had that experience at 3am.its a long story but all of us ended up packing up our bags and check out 5am in the morning.still,the place is quiet and nice kapag sa umaga and afternoon.u can jog and relax kasi ang sarap ng weather.you can bring foods and enjoy the calmness of the sorroundings kapag gusto mo mag pa ka alone.üòÇ.so overall 5 star for them."
Teacher's Camp,Mura lang but scary ambiance. If you are in a budget  this is a place to go. For 200php to 300php a night that would be neat. Just don't choose the quirino hall it's freaky.
Teacher's Camp,I had attended an International Seminar last week in here. There are different halls to hold different conferences.  There are dormitories too. A mess hall is also available where participants can be served food.
Teacher's Camp,Rich history. Glad this is preserved. :)
Teacher's Camp,"There are adequate securities manning the entrances and several buildings. However, additional lightings (street lamps etc.) are needed within the camp to further security measures."
Teacher's Camp,"A good place to stay. In addition to that they have free toiletries, friendly personnel and great ambiance."
